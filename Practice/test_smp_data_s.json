[{"Date": "Bulletin \u2013 November 2004", "Text": {"Subtext": ["Download the complete Statement 510KB", "The Australian economy has continued to perform well during 2004, maintaining a solid pace of expansion and low inflation. Business and consumer confidence are at high levels, and there has been some scaling back in the year to date of the excesses in the housing market that had threatened to disrupt the economy last year. The economy has benefited from a generally favourable international environment and rising commodity prices. The sharp rise in oil prices over recent months has emerged as a possible dampening factor for global growth, but the effects at this stage are difficult to predict.", "For the international economy, the current year has been a period of further recovery, though growth has eased from its rapid pace earlier in the year. The recovery in the United States, now entering its fourth year, appears well entrenched. Business investment and consumer spending are continuing to expand strongly and business confidence remains relatively high. Employment is increasing at a steady pace, though not as rapidly as earlier in the year. Other parts of the global economy continue to experience generally strong conditions. In Japan, business surveys report that conditions improved further in the September quarter to be at around their best in a decade. The Chinese economy is expanding rapidly and has become an important driver of overall global growth. Despite a modest slowing since the start of the year, the Chinese authorities remain concerned that the economy is in an overheated condition, and this prompted a rise in official interest rates in October to supplement the earlier tightening in credit controls. Growth in the smaller east Asian economies has been strong over the past year, though the pace appears to have eased recently, while the euro area is continuing its gradual recovery.", "An important feature of the current economic upswing is that it has been associated with broadly based increases in commodity prices. At the global level, attention has focused particularly on the rise in oil prices and the possible impact this might have on global economic performance. The rise in oil prices has been, to a significant degree, a consequence of global economic strength rather than of disruptions to supply, though supply factors have clearly also played a part. It is to be expected that the rise in oil prices will dampen growth of the global economy and boost consumer prices relative to what would otherwise have been the case, but the size of these effects will depend importantly on the extent to which the recent increases are sustained.", "While the rise in oil prices this year has attracted the greatest attention, there have also been strong price increases for a wide range of other mineral commodities. The RBA base metals index, for example, has increased by almost 30 per cent in foreign currency terms over the past year, and there have been substantial increases in coal and iron ore prices. For a commodity exporter such as Australia this represents a significant boost to the terms of trade and is thus providing a stimulus to incomes and spending. As discussed below, rising commodity prices have also begun to put some upward pressure on prices more broadly.", "Financial markets have generally taken the view that the negative impact of rising oil prices on global economic activity will more than outweigh any inflationary impact. Thus rising oil prices over recent months have resulted in falling bond yields and reduced expectations of monetary tightening. Yields on 10-year bonds in the US have fallen back to around 4 per cent, a decline of about 70 basis points since mid year, and similar movements have occurred in bond markets in other countries. This is an unusual development against the background of early-cycle rises in official interest rates. Rising oil prices have also contributed to a lacklustre performance by the US share market, which has shown little net change since the start of 2004 despite strong economic growth in the US. Reflecting the overall negative sentiment in US financial markets, the US dollar has resumed the depreciating trend that began in early 2002.", "In Australia, while the yield curve has flattened in line with developments in international markets, other financial prices have suggested a more buoyant sentiment. In particular, the Australian share market remains very strong, significantly outperforming those in other countries this year, and the Australian dollar has risen substantially over recent months. A common theme affecting both the share market and the exchange rate has been the strength in global commodity markets. Other economies with heavy exposures to commodities \u2013 Canada, New Zealand and South Africa \u2013 are also doing well and their currencies have also risen more than most against the US dollar.", "The most recent economic data in Australia indicate that the economy is continuing to perform strongly. Business surveys have generally reported above-average conditions in the September quarter, in some cases suggesting that conditions were close to their best in a decade. Similarly, consumer confidence has been at near-record levels for the past four months. Retail sales figures, although unexpectedly soft in July and August, picked up in September, and it is likely that household spending is continuing to be boosted by the tax cuts and increased benefit payments announced in the May Budget.", "Conditions in the labour market are also firm. Employment increased strongly in September, following some softer figures in the previous three months, with the unemployment rate remaining around 5\u00bd per cent. Looking through the recent monthly volatility, labour market conditions continue to reflect a strongly growing economy, with employment having grown by 2.5 per cent over the past year. The bulk of this increase has been accounted for by full-time jobs. Prospects for further employment growth appear to be good, with business surveys suggesting that hiring intentions are at high levels.", "The overall growth of the economy has remained highly dependent on domestic demand, with the expected recovery in exports slow to develop. While rural and services exports have picked up over the past year, capacity constraints have continued to hamper exports from the resources sector. However, strong growth in investment in that sector over the past couple of years should see significant additional productive capacity starting to come on stream over the year ahead. At the same time, as noted above, the economy is benefiting from sharp increases in commodity export prices, and this has contributed to the growth in domestic incomes and spending.", "Inflation in Australia remains relatively low, though signs of upward pressure are now beginning to emerge in some areas. CPI inflation was 2.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter, down marginally from the previous quarter, with most underlying measures running slightly below the headline figure. In addition, despite reports of shortages of labour, aggregate wages growth remains under control at this stage. Over the past couple of years, the trend in underlying inflation has been one of gradual decline, reflecting the lagged impact of the exchange rate appreciation that took place during 2002 and 2003. However, this trend appears now to have largely run its course, and underlying inflation is likely to start rising next year as the impact of the earlier appreciation fades. Inflation in the non-tradables sector of the economy remains relatively high, though it has eased recently as a result of a slowing in housing construction costs. Producer price figures for the September quarter were higher than expected, with rising global commodity prices contributing significantly to upstream price increases.", "Currently it is expected that underlying inflation will rise gradually to around 2\u00bd per cent by the end of 2005 and slightly higher by mid 2006. Headline CPI inflation will remain higher than underlying measures in the coming year, reflecting the effect of higher petrol prices. While this outlook is similar to that presented in the August Statement, it is apparent that the trough in inflation will not be as low as had been expected at the beginning of the year, when both headline and underlying measures had been forecast to decline to a trough of 1\u00bd per cent by the end of this year. In part this upward revision has reflected the lower exchange rate prevailing over much of the period since then.", "Developments in credit and housing markets point to a continuation of the adjustment apparent since the early part of the year. Available data for house prices in the September quarter have again indicated flat or declining prices in most cities and at the national aggregate level. The adjustment to date has been an orderly one, so that the risk of an uncomfortably sharp decline in house prices does not appear to be large, though equally there does not appear much risk of a renewed upsurge at present. In addition to this adjustment occurring in the housing market, there has been a welcome slowing in household credit in recent months, following the earlier declines in loan approvals.", "In summary, then, the information becoming available over recent months has continued to indicate a favourable combination of circumstances for the Australian economy. In particular, while business conditions have remained strong, inflation declined further in the September quarter and wage increases at an aggregate level have been well contained. Although financial conditions remain moderately accommodative, the excesses in house price inflation and household borrowing that were apparent last year have been reduced, with a consequent easing of the risk of disruption to the economy from those sources. In these circumstances the Board did not see a case for monetary policy to be tightened when it reviewed the policy setting at its three most recent monthly meetings. In light of the economic data becoming available during this period, the Board's decisions to hold the cash rate unchanged were well anticipated and provoked no reaction in financial markets.", "Looking ahead, the international economic environment is likely to remain supportive of growth in Australia, with the global recovery well established and strong commodity prices providing a firm underpinning to the Australian economy. Although inflation in Australia is relatively low at present, it is expected to begin rising gradually next year, and the recent strength in upstream price pressures is consistent with this outlook. Accordingly, while there is no pressing need for higher interest rates at this stage, it continues to appear likely that the economy will require higher interest rates at some stage of the current expansion. The Board will continue to monitor developments and to make such adjustments to policy as may be required to promote sustainable growth of the economy with low inflation.", "Conditions in the international economy remain generally favourable, and growth is becoming more broad-based geographically. The global expansion is continuing, although the pace of growth has moderated from the very rapid rates seen in the second half of 2003 and start of 2004. This has been most evident in the United States and Japan. The economies of east Asia continue to enjoy strong growth and the recovery in the euro area has become more firmly established. Strong growth is also evident in the emerging economies of Latin America and eastern Europe. Oil prices are at high levels, but this has not yet prompted any significant revisions to growth forecasts. In its latest assessment of the international outlook, the IMF forecasts that world GDP will grow by 5.0 per cent in 2004, which would be the fastest rate of growth in nearly 30 years (Graph 1, Table 1). World GDP growth is then expected to ease to 4.3 per cent in 2005, largely reflecting the return to more normal rates of growth in the US and Japan. Persistently high world oil prices would, however, be likely to see downward revisions to growth forecasts for 2005.", "In light of this strong global growth, central banks around the world have continued the process of removing some of their earlier policy stimulus. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, Bank of Canada and a number of other central banks have lifted their policy rates in the past three months. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have again been notable exceptions, leaving rates unchanged in response to the more modest recovery underway in those countries.", "After experiencing a patch of softer growth around mid year, the US economy has picked up in recent months. Real GDP grew by 0.9 per cent in the September quarter to be 3.9 per cent higher in year-ended terms (Graph 2). The stronger September quarter result largely reflected a rebound in consumption growth after a lull in the June quarter; business investment continues to expand strongly.", "Recent employment data have generally been disappointing, but most other indicators point to a brighter outlook for the labour market. Non-farm payrolls have posted only modest gains since June, after rising strongly in the first five months of the year (Graph 3). The string of hurricanes that hit the US in August and September appears to have had a temporary downward influence on payrolls. The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 6.3 per cent in mid 2003 to 5.4 per cent in September, but this decline can be partly attributed to a falling participation rate. Other indicators of the labour market are generally quite positive, consistent with the healthy pace of GDP growth. Initial jobless claims are running at around 340,000 per week \u2013 a level usually commensurate with monthly payroll gains of roughly 150,000\u2013200,000. Strong growth in temporary-help services jobs, which in the past has been a reliable predictor of payroll employment, suggests near-term increases in employment of a similar magnitude in coming months. The employment indices from both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISM surveys are at high levels, which would normally be consistent with monthly payroll gains of around 200,000, or a little above.", "Consumption grew by 1.1 per cent in the September quarter, up from the 0.4 per cent growth recorded in the June quarter, to be 3.5 per cent higher over the year. Growth in household net wealth slowed slightly over the June quarter, but over the year it has been a strong 11 per cent. The recovery in employment should underpin further solid growth in household spending. Against this, consumer sentiment has recently weakened, possibly due to the run-up in oil prices, after having registered solid gains over the year to mid 2004. Following strong activity in the housing sector in recent years, growth in residential investment slowed in the September quarter, but it remains around 8\u00bd per cent higher over the year, supported by low long-term fixed mortgage rates. Leading indicators of activity, such as housing starts and approvals, appear to have reached a plateau, although builders' confidence is at a high level.", "Conditions in the business sector remain positive. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISM indices have come off their recent highs, but remain at expansionary levels (Graph 4). Business investment grew by 2.8 per cent in the September quarter, to be up by nearly 10 per cent over the year. The growth over the past year has largely reflected increased equipment investment, although non-residential construction investment grew for the second successive quarter, after declining for much of the previous few years. Core capital goods orders, which are a timely indicator of equipment investment, are growing at an annual pace of around 10 per cent. Financing conditions remain very supportive of investment growth; in particular, corporate profits grew by 19 per cent over the year to the June quarter and are quite high relative to GDP. Corporate gearing continues to decline and interest rates for corporate borrowing remain very low, even though the Fed funds rate is now rising. Firms may also be bringing forward some capital spending in order to take advantage of accelerated depreciation allowances that expire at the end of the year.", "After a noticeable pick-up in inflationary pressures in the first five months of the year, core CPI inflation has been a little more subdued recently, and was 2.0 per cent over the year to September. The effect of crude oil price increases on headline inflation has been surprisingly modest in recent months, with year-ended headline inflation actually easing from 3.3 per cent in June to 2.5 per cent in September. There are still signs of significant upstream price pressures; the prices-paid indices from both of the ISM surveys are at high levels. With the US economy firmly on an expansionary path, the Federal Reserve has continued the process of returning interest rates to more normal levels, raising the funds rate by 25 basis points in both August and September to 1.75 per cent.", "The Japanese economy continues to recover, though growth has moderated from the rapid pace recorded around the start of the year. Following two very strong quarters, real GDP expanded by 0.3 per cent in the June quarter, to be 4.3 per cent higher over the year. The extent of the fall in the deflator is probably overstated, which might be boosting measured real GDP; nominal GDP grew by a more modest 1.4 per cent over the year to the June quarter (Graph 5).", "Having made significant progress in mending its balance sheet, the Japanese corporate sector appears in much better health than it has been in for many years. Corporate profits rose by 6.5 per cent in the June quarter and by 33 per cent over the year. This healthy cash flow points to further strength in investment (Graph 6). It has also enabled firms to repay their outstanding debts, with corporate debt (as a share of GDP) falling to levels not seen since the late 1980s. Consistent with this, business conditions, as reported by the Tankan and Shoko Chukin surveys, have improved to decade-high levels, with the manufacturing sector generally outperforming the services sector. On the other hand, indicators of corporate activity such as industrial production, machinery orders and merchandise exports point to some easing of growth since the start of the year. Much of this can be attributed to developments in the ITC sector, where inventories have risen significantly in recent months, suggesting the beginnings of a downturn in the sector.", "The outlook for the labour market remains relatively upbeat. Despite some recent volatility, the unemployment rate has been on a downward trend and stood at 4.6 per cent in September, down from 5\u00bd per cent in early 2003. A shrinking labour force, associated with an aging population, has driven some of the fall, but employment has also picked up over the past year, as reported in both the household and payrolls surveys. Forward-looking indicators, such as surveyed hiring intentions and the ratio of job offers to applicants, also point to further gains in the near term.", "Data on the household sector have been more mixed, but on balance remain positive. With employment prospects improving, consumer sentiment has risen to its highest level since the early 1990s, while indicators of consumer spending, such as retail sales and consumer goods shipments, have generally been trending upwards in recent months. However, cash wage earnings continue to fall in year-ended terms, held down partly by fairly weak summer bonuses, and weigh on the outlook for household spending.", "Consistent with the upswing in activity, deflationary pressures continue to ease, though falling prices are likely to persist for some time yet as there remains considerable spare capacity in the economy. Core consumer prices were flat over the year to September, compared with deflation rates of around 1 per cent in the past few years. Reflecting the run-up in world commodity prices, domestic corporate goods prices have increased by 1.8 per cent over the year to September \u2013 the fastest rate of increase since 1991.", "There has been a modest slowing in growth in the Chinese economy in recent months as government measures aimed at curbing over-investment in certain sectors and reducing credit and money growth have taken effect. The authorities tightened monetary policy in late October, on concerns that investment growth is still very strong. Growth in China continues to run well ahead of that seen in most other countries.", "Compared with year-ended rates in excess of 9\u00bd per cent in recent quarters, China's real GDP rose by 9.1 per cent over the year to the September quarter. The slowdown was most pronounced in the sectors that have been targeted by the authorities. Growth in fixed-asset investment came down to around 28 per cent over the year to September, from more than 50 per cent at the start of the year. Growth in credit and the money supply has also slowed roughly in line with the official targets for 2004. In contrast, there has been only a gentle slowing in growth in industrial production, which eased to 16.1 per cent over the year to September from a peak of 19.4 per cent in March (Graph 7). Growth in trade has also moderated over recent months, but remains strong. The value of merchandise exports increased by around 33 per cent over the year to September, with imports 21 per cent higher over the same period. Household expenditure remains buoyant, with retail sales continuing to grow rapidly, underpinned by rising per capita incomes.", "Consumer price inflation has risen, to 5.2 per cent over the year to September, close to its highest rate in over seven years. Food prices continue to be the main driver of inflation, rising by 13 per cent over the year to September, but this upward pressure appears to be easing as domestic supply expands. Excluding food, consumer prices generally remain contained, though some pressure on housing costs has emerged recently; this component of the CPI was 6.4 per cent higher over the year to September.", "Growth in the rest of east Asia has also slowed somewhat from its earlier rapid pace, although it remains reasonably firm. In aggregate, GDP increased by a little more than 7 per cent over the year to June, although this figure was boosted by the rebound from the SARS-related weakness mid last year. In the quarter, growth eased in line with developments elsewhere in the world (Table 2). Domestic demand is picking up in most countries in the region, underpinned by improving labour markets and still-stimulatory macroeconomic policies. Korea is still an exception, with domestic demand remaining weak amid little sign of a turnaround in household consumption. High oil prices are likely to weigh on growth in east Asia more than elsewhere, because its economy is a relatively intense user of oil, almost all of which is imported. Of course, strong growth in east Asia has also been one of the key factors pushing up oil prices.", "Export growth slowed in the June quarter, and recent indicators suggest that this trend has continued. Annual growth in merchandise exports has slowed from 29 per cent over the year to May to 23 per cent over the year to September, and is expected to moderate further in conjunction with the easing in Chinese growth. In addition, signs are emerging that the global upswing in ITC demand, which has been a significant driver of the region's export growth, may have peaked. Industrial production has also levelled off recently, to be 8 per cent higher over the year to August, down from 14 per cent in May (Graph 8).", "In contrast, the outlook for domestic demand remains favourable; interest rates are low, capacity utilisation rates are high and the labour markets in the region are improving. Activity in Taiwan and Hong Kong should also receive a boost from rising asset prices following a prolonged period of deflation. Korea is the main exception to this outlook; domestic activity continues to be constrained by weak consumption, which declined again in the June quarter \u2013 its third successive quarterly contraction \u2013 to be 0.6 per cent lower over the year and 2.9 per cent below its peak in late 2002. Korea's monthly retail and wholesale sales also show little sign of a pick-up, with the labour market worsening recently and consumer confidence remaining depressed.", "There has been a noticeable increase in consumer price inflation across much of east Asia in recent months (Graph 9). This appears to be largely due to higher food and energy prices, with underlying measures of inflation showing more modest rates of increase. However, there are signs that upstream price pressures are building amidst strong economic growth, and most central banks in the region have tightened monetary policy. The Bank of Korea, in contrast, cut its policy rate by 25 basis points in August to 3.5 per cent in order to stimulate domestic activity.", "Growth in the Indian economy slowed in the first half of 2004 but remains healthy; over the year to the June quarter, real GDP increased by 7.3 per cent, down from more than 10 per cent over 2003. Industrial production continues to grow strongly, rising by 7.8 per cent over the year to August, and exports are up by 17.4 per cent over the year to September, although they have been broadly flat recently. A poor monsoon season is likely to constrain agricultural production in the period ahead. Inflation has increased noticeably in the past few months; the wholesale price index, the preferred inflation indicator in India, was up by 7.4 per cent over the year to September. In response, the Reserve Bank of India tightened monetary policy in late October.", "The euro area recovery appears to be gaining momentum, although it is geographically uneven and still highly reliant on external demand. Euro area GDP grew by 0.5 per cent in the June quarter, to be 2.0 per cent higher over the year. The increase was almost entirely due to growth in net exports, with consumption and investment remaining weak. The stimulus to consumption from tax cuts at the beginning of the year appears not to have carried over into the June quarter. The share of investment in GDP has fallen to its lowest level in 15 years.", "The pattern of growth varies considerably across euro area countries (Graph 10). Among the larger countries, France has been growing at the fastest pace, driven by strength in domestic demand and wealth effects from rising house prices. In Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, domestic demand remains sluggish and recent growth has been dependent on net exports. In Germany, consumer spending appears to have been restrained by uncertainty surrounding proposed welfare reforms, and investment remains weak despite a pick-up in corporate profitability. Germany's tight credit conditions may also be discouraging investment spending.", "More timely indicators suggest that the euro area's modest recovery should continue. Extra-regional merchandise exports grew by 9.4 per cent over the year to August. On the back of this external demand, euro-wide industrial production has been growing fairly steadily, at an annual rate of around 2 per cent in recent months. Business sentiment in the area has continued to edge higher and is now above long-run average levels (Graph 11), although German business confidence has weakened recently on concerns about the continued lack of domestic demand.", "The recovery in consumer sentiment over the past year has been more modest, and sentiment remains below average levels. Lacklustre labour market outcomes and reform-related uncertainty have constrained confidence and spending. The euro-wide unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 9.0 per cent and shows little sign of improvement in the near term. Retail sales have been broadly unchanged of late.", "Continued upward pressure from energy prices has kept overall inflation above the ECB's 2 per cent reference rate since May, although underlying measures of inflation have remained around 2 per cent. The impact of energy prices has been more pronounced in producer price inflation, which climbed to 3.1 per cent over the year to August. Year-ended growth in labour costs has continued to ease, reaching 2.2 per cent over the year to the June quarter, consistent with the subdued labour market. The ECB has held its policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent since June 2003.", "After growing at a stronger-than-expected 0.9 per cent in the June quarter, the UK's GDP expanded by a moderate 0.4 per cent in the September quarter, to be 3 per cent higher over the year. More recent data suggest slower growth than the above-trend pace of the past year. Merchandise exports were broadly flat in the three months to August, hampered by soft demand from the euro area. Manufacturing production fell in September for the third consecutive month, although this outcome was somewhat at odds with the relatively upbeat business surveys.", "Consumer confidence is also high, and labour market conditions remain tight; according to the Labour Force Survey, the unemployment rate has fallen to an historically low 4.7 per cent. In the past few years consumer spending has received a significant fillip from rising house prices, but recent data suggest some cooling in the market. According to the Nationwide and Halifax surveys, there was a marked slowing in house price growth in the past three months, although prices remain well above levels of a year ago (Graph 12). The value of housing loan approvals has dropped sharply from its peak in September last year. Despite the strength of economic activity since the middle of 2003, inflation has remained well below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target, and was 1.1 per cent over the year to September. The Bank of England raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 per cent in August.", "Oil prices increased sharply over the three months to October, before reversing somewhat in early November. Global production capacity has continued to be stretched by strong demand, and short-term disruptions to supply have compounded the pressures on prices. Prices averaged just above US$53 per barrel in October, which is the highest nominal price on record, and around 75 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 13). However, in real terms they remain well below the levels observed following the second OPEC oil shock of late 1979, and the recent rate of increase has been much less pronounced than during that episode.", "According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), expectations of oil demand in 2004 have been steadily revised up over the course of the year, to 82.4 million barrels per day (bpd), a 5.8 per cent increase in demand from two years ago. Global demand has been especially boosted by higher demand from China, which has risen by 1.3 million bpd, or 26 per cent over the past two years. With no similar expansion in global supply capacity, the amount of spare capacity has fallen to very low levels.", "Potential and realised disruptions to short-term supply have exacerbated these trends, placing additional upward pressure on prices. Sabotage to oil infrastructure in Iraq has led to ongoing supply disruptions, while concerns remain over the outlook for production at Yukos, a Russian oil firm that is in danger of bankruptcy. Also, Hurricane Ivan recently disrupted production in the US, while labour unrest and threats from rebel militia have placed some doubt over the stability of oil supply from Nigeria. Some market analysts have estimated that these short-term supply problems, plus the current low level of commercial stocks of oil, have contributed to a risk premium of at least US$10 per barrel in prices.", "Many central banks around the world have begun the process of unwinding the very accommodative settings of monetary policy that have been in place over the past couple of years. The tightening process thus far has been very gradual, and two major central banks, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, have yet to commence.", "The US Federal Reserve has continued on the path begun in June, raising the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of its two meetings since the last Statement, to the current level of 1.75 per cent (Graph 14). Like the June move, the two most recent interest rate increases were widely anticipated and had little impact on financial markets. The federal funds futures market is expecting the Fed to raise rates by a further 25 basis points at the November meeting, before pausing in December. Beyond that, markets are expecting a slower pace of tightening, in part reflecting their assessment that the contractionary effect on growth of the large rise in oil prices will outweigh the inflationary impact in the medium term. Futures markets are currently pricing in only a further 50 basis points increase in the federal funds rate by mid 2005 which, if realised, would still leave short-term rates at an historically low level.", "Financial markets still do not expect a shift in monetary policy in either the euro area or Japan until well into 2005. The European Central Bank has stated that it is comfortable that the economy is recovering gradually, although it is concerned about the effect of higher oil prices. The Bank of Japan's recently released inflation forecasts imply that an exit from its quantitative easing framework remains some way off given its position that this would occur only when inflation is consistently positive.", "The Bank of England (BoE), Bank of Canada (BoC), Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have all raised their policy rates over the past three months (Table 3, Graph 15). The two 25 basis point increases by the BoC have partially reversed a cumulative easing of 75 basis points at its first three meetings this year. The market's expectation is that the tightening cycle in both the UK and New Zealand is nearly complete, whereas both the BoC and the SNB are expected to tighten policy further over the coming year.", "Monetary policy was also tightened in a number of emerging markets. In China, benchmark interest rates were raised and the ceiling on bank lending rates was also removed. These actions follow administrative tightening measures and increases in reserve requirements adopted over the past year. India, Thailand and Taiwan each increased interest rates for the first time in the current cycle, although policy rates in the latter two countries remain below 2 per cent. Short-term interest rates also increased in Hong Kong following the US tightenings, in line with Hong Kong's currency board arrangement. In contrast, the Bank of Korea surprised markets by lowering the overnight call rate by 25 basis points, to 3.5 per cent, in order to stimulate lacklustre domestic demand, notwithstanding the economy's ongoing inflation concerns.", "Mounting inflationary pressures across Latin America prompted the central banks of Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru to tighten monetary policy. Among emerging European countries, the central banks of the Czech Republic, Poland and the Ukraine all increased their policy rates. In contrast, monetary policy was eased in Hungary and South Africa because of the impact of their appreciating exchange rates in terms of easing inflationary pressures. Turkey reduced rates by 200 basis points, reflecting growing confidence that inflation will continue to fall under a new IMF program.", "Despite the 75 basis points increase in the federal funds rate, long-term bond yields in the US have declined steadily since mid year, falling back to around 4 per cent (Graph 16). The large rise in oil prices has had a marked influence on bond yields over the period. As mentioned above, the market is expecting the contractionary effect of oil price rises on growth to outweigh their inflationary effect, and hence increases in the oil price have tended to be associated with a decrease in yields over recent months. Indeed, the expected inflation rate derived from indexed bond yields has drifted lower over the past six months. The decline in bond yields has also been driven by a reduction in the expected pace of tightening over the coming year, in turn reflecting weaker-than-expected US employment data in recent months and the anticipated effect of the oil price rises.", "Yields in Europe and Japan have closely followed those in the US over the past three months. Yields on German government 10-year debt have fallen around 50 basis points since their mid-June peak, while Japanese yields fell back to around the levels seen prior to the sharp increase in June.", "The desire of investors to seek out higher yields in an environment of low funding costs, combined with a favourable economic climate globally, has seen risk spreads continue to decline. US corporate spreads to Treasury yields have narrowed modestly over recent months and have reversed the widening that occurred in May in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle (Graph 17). Given the relatively low level of Treasury yields, the absolute cost of corporate borrowing is at a very low level.", "Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt have also continued to reverse the widening that occurred earlier in the year (Graph 18). The decline has been particularly marked in Latin America following credit rating upgrades for Brazil and Venezuela. Similarly, the narrowing in emerging Europe was supported by upgrades to the credit rating outlook for Russia and Poland, in the former case prompted in part by rising oil revenue. Spreads in Asia narrowed slightly.", "In the US, the S&P 500 is little changed so far this year, after the strong increases last year (Table 4). The recent lacklustre performance comes despite continued strong growth in company profits: S&P 500 operating earnings rose by 32 per cent in the year to the June quarter, while growth in \u2018as reported\u2019 earnings was even stronger, at 39 per cent.", "High oil and commodity prices have boosted profits in the energy and materials sectors, which both recorded growth in operating earnings of around 70 per cent in the year to the June quarter. Shares in the energy sector have risen by 24 per cent this year (Table 5), but this sector accounts for only 7 per cent of the S&P 500. However, the net impact of high oil prices on the overall market has been negative. Along with some tempering of the optimism that prevailed earlier in the year about the growth outlook, rising oil prices have contributed to the expectation that profit growth will slow considerably in the period ahead. Only the industrials sector and the telecommunications sector \u2013 which was the only sector to record a fall in earnings in the year to June \u2013 are expected to register a modest improvement in profit growth over 2004.", "In mid October, shares in the insurance industry fell by over 10 per cent as the New York Attorney General charged Marsh & McLennan, the largest insurance broker, with improper practices. Shares in the auto industry also declined sharply following poor earnings figures from General Motors (GM) and news of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into pension and health benefit accounting procedures at Ford and GM.", "In the euro area, equity markets have risen by 7 per cent since the last Statement, and are up by a similar amount in 2004 to date. In Japan, on the other hand, the combination of higher oil prices and the unexpected downward revision to second quarter GDP have seen equities fall by 4 per cent over this period; however they remain 5 per cent higher in the year to date.", "Emerging equity markets have outperformed those in the major economies in recent months, with share prices in both Latin America and emerging Asia rising by an average of around 11 per cent since early August. South Korean share prices have risen by 18 per cent in response to the Bank of Korea's decision to lower interest rates to boost domestic demand. Indonesian equities rose by 17 per cent over the past three months, supported by the election of the new President. The equity market in Argentina has experienced the strongest gains in Latin America in recent months, rising by 31 per cent following the Argentine government's recent agreement to reschedule some of its defaulted debt, but this follows a decline of around 35 per cent earlier in the year.", "For much of the past three months, there was little to provide clear direction for foreign exchange markets, and the US dollar traded within a narrow range of 109 to 112 against the yen and around 1.20 to 1.25 against the euro. However, since late October, it appears that the US dollar has renewed the path of depreciation it has been on since early 2002 (Graph 19). The US dollar fell as low as 1.28 against the euro, just above the trough reached in mid February, and below 106 against the yen.", "The currencies of a number of countries seen as having large exports of commodities (Australia, Canada, New Zealand) have risen by more than most other currencies against the US dollar over the past couple of months (Table 6), reflecting the continuing strength of global commodity markets and notwithstanding a sharp drop in base metal prices in mid October.", "Latin American exchange rates have appreciated by an average of 4 per cent against the US dollar since early August. In part this has reflected the increasingly positive economic outlook for Latin America \u2013 in particular Brazil, where the real has strengthened by around 8 per cent against the US dollar since the last Statement. In contrast, a number of Asian currencies have moved by only relatively small amounts against the US dollar, as intervention activity appears to have increased again. The pound sterling has shown little net movement recently, reflecting the assessment that the Bank of England's tightening cycle is close to complete.", "Expectations of a revaluation of the Chinese currency have reappeared in the past three months, after having been scaled back considerably since the early part of the year. Speculation centred on a change to China's exchange rate regime associated with the October meeting of G7 Finance Ministers. However, Chinese officials have continued to deny that any change is likely in the immediate future, although they have indicated that they have examined possible alternative regimes. The 1-year non-deliverable forward (NDF) rate for the renminbi has risen by around 2 per cent in the past three months, to be around 3 per cent higher than the spot rate, and 4 per cent higher than the rate implied by interest differentials alone. Despite the recent strengthening in expectations of a revaluation, the probability attached to a revaluation remains lower than at the beginning of the year, when renminbi NDFs were trading at a premium of 5 per cent to the spot rate, and 7 per cent to the rate implied by interest differentials.", "The Australian dollar reached a six-month high on both a trade-weighted basis and against the US dollar in early November (Graph 20). As noted above, the strength in the Australian dollar has been in line with that in currencies of other commodity exporters (Table 7). Another factor supporting the Australian dollar has been the continuation of solid Uridashi issuance, which has amounted to around A$6 billion over the past three months.", "The strong demand for the Australian dollar over the past couple of years has meant that the Australian dollar/US dollar is now the fourth most traded currency pair globally, according to the latest survey of foreign exchange activity published by the Bank for International Settlements (see Box A).", "In line with the recent movements in the exchange rate, market sentiment towards the Australian dollar has become more positive recently, after declining sharply as the exchange rate fell from its peak in mid February. Speculative positioning in Australian dollar futures on the Chicago Futures Exchange has risen significantly to relatively substantial long positions, which are now back at levels last seen in early February (Graph 21). Sentiment in the Australian dollar options market, as indicated by 1-month risk reversals (a measure derived from the relative prices of put and call options in the Australian dollar), has returned to its highest level in around seven months. That is, there is now substantially less probability attached to a near-term depreciation of the Australian dollar than was the case some months ago. Over the past three months, Australian dollar volatility has also fallen back to around its post-float average after rising sharply in the first half of the year.", "Over the past three months, the Bank's foreign exchange purchases were broadly in line with the amount needed to cover sales of foreign exchange to the Government. As a result, net reserves have remained relatively unchanged at just under $25 billion since the middle of the year. Holdings of foreign exchange under swaps have fluctuated, due to the continuing use of swaps in domestic liquidity management.", "Growth in the Australian economy remains solid, though the expected impetus from the external sector has not yet developed. In the June quarter, GDP grew by 0.6 per cent, with growth over the year above trend at 4.1 per cent, reflecting the very strong quarterly outcomes in the second half of 2003 (Graph 22). Growth in the June quarter was driven by domestic demand, with continued strong consumption spending, a rebound in business investment and a further increase in dwelling investment. Partly offsetting this strength was a much less rapid accumulation of stocks than in the March quarter, and a further fall in net exports as imports rose slightly faster than exports, though the subtraction from growth was only modest. The recovery in the rural sector also appears to have run its course, with farm production falling in the quarter after a run of sizeable contributions to GDP growth.", "Although forward indicators suggest a slowing in business investment growth and the possibility of modest falls in dwelling investment in the second half of 2004, household consumption is likely to stay firm, with consumer sentiment remaining around record highs and households receiving a substantial boost to their incomes from recent Budget initiatives. A rebalancing of activity between domestic and external sources of demand is also likely to become evident over the year ahead, with net exports expected to be a much smaller drag on growth than in the past few years.", "The rapid pace of consumer spending over the course of 2003 and early 2004 continued into the June quarter, with household consumption rising by 1.1 per cent to be 6.1 per cent higher over the year; this was the fifth consecutive quarterly rise in excess of 1 per cent. Growth in the June quarter was concentrated in services, with particular strength in spending on transport, health and recreation & culture; growth in spending on goods was more moderate. More recently, in the September quarter, the volume of retail sales increased by 0.9 per cent. Much of the growth occurred late in the quarter, with the value of retail sales rising by 0.8 per cent in September; this followed a pullback in spending in the preceding two months from the spike recorded in June. Retail spending has been especially volatile in recent months, partly reflecting the staggered timing of the government payments to households related to measures announced in the 2004/05 Budget. Spending on motor vehicles rose slightly in the September quarter to a record high (Graph 23).", "The ongoing strength in consumption is being underpinned by a generally favourable economic environment. Household incomes remain supported by solid employment growth and rising real wages. Earlier strong gains in house prices have increased household wealth significantly since the late 1990s. Households have also received income tax cuts and increased family benefit payments in recent months, with a further cut in income tax to take effect next July. Consistent with these factors, consumer sentiment has remained close to its highest level in 30 years. Nevertheless, the sharply higher fuel prices evident in recent months are likely to contain growth in discretionary expenditure. Furthermore, as wealth effects diminish in line with the easing in house prices since late 2003, households may become more restrained in their spending.", "Total household assets have risen at a modest pace during 2004, after increasing significantly in the preceding five years, reflecting the recent moderation in house price growth. However, at the same time, household borrowings have been rising strongly, by around 17 per cent over the past year. With ongoing rises in household debt, the burden of servicing it is now historically high, reaching over 9 per cent of household disposable income in the June quarter (Graph 24). While this ratio was largely unchanged from the March quarter, it is expected to increase further as a consequence of ongoing credit growth. At this stage, though, there is little indication that debt-servicing burdens are affecting household behaviour, with personal bankruptcy rates and housing loan arrears at very low levels.", "Dwelling investment continued to expand over the first half of 2004, though at a much slower pace than during the second half of 2003. It increased by around 1 per cent in the June quarter, to be almost 12 per cent higher over the year, with the increase in the quarter driven by growth in alterations and additions while new dwelling construction was broadly unchanged.", "The housing construction sector is operating at close to maximum capacity, with a large stock of outstanding work to be done. However, forward indicators point to an easing in new construction in the period ahead. The downward trend evident in building approvals for houses over the past year has continued in recent months, with house approvals now 13.7 per cent lower than the average in 2003. The volatile medium-density series is still at a high level, but is well below the peaks seen in recent years (Graph 25). Other leading indicators of housing demand, including display home traffic and land sales, remain subdued in most states, and the Housing Industry Association series of commitments to build fell further in September. Despite the recent easing in demand, residential construction activity is expected to remain around current levels for the remainder of 2004, supported by the large amount of work in the pipeline. This is particularly so in the medium-density sector, where many apartments are committed for construction. There are also many apartment projects that have been approved but not yet commenced, though it is not clear whether this reflects delays as a result of capacity constraints or cancellations of building work approved as investors retreat from this market. Housing activity is also likely to be supported by continued high levels of alterations and additions, given the backlog of work and continuing strong demand for renovations.", "After peaking at $15 billion in late 2003, the value of monthly housing loan approvals has been broadly stable during 2004, averaging just above $12 billion per month (Graph 26). This stability has masked divergent trends in loan approvals to owner-occupiers and investors. After declines late last year, approvals to owner-occupiers have since grown, while those to investors have continued to fall. This fall is likely to reflect diminished prospects of capital growth and the recognition of persistently low returns in rental markets.", "The rate of growth of housing credit has continued to decline during 2004. In September, housing credit increased by 1 per cent following a similar rise in August. On a three-month-ended basis, a pronounced slowing is now apparent, with housing credit expanding at an annual rate of 13 per cent over the latest three months, compared with a peak growth rate of 24 per cent over the three months to November last year. The decline in housing-related credit growth has been larger than expected based on the fall in loan approvals to date, suggesting that, among other things, some combination of a pick-up in repayments and lower usage of mortgage redraw facilities has contributed to the decline.", "A reasonable range of information on house prices in the September quarter is now available. As in the March and June quarters, the majority of indicators show that house prices fell in the quarter, and over the year to date (Graph 27 and Table 8).[1] Figures from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (which are based on house purchases funded by the CBA and are not subject to revision) suggest that nationwide house prices fell in the September quarter, with declines in most capitals. Data from the state Real Estate Institutes (REIs) point to moderate falls or broadly unchanged prices in the four capitals for which September quarter data were available at the start of November. Data from land titles offices supplied by Australian Property Monitors (APM) also point to a fall in average nationwide prices for transactions contracted in the September quarter, but these are only early estimates and are subject to upward revision as more transactions are recorded. Data on repeat sales from Residex, also from land titles offices, point to house prices falling slightly in Sydney and Brisbane and rising slightly in Melbourne. Overall, in the March and June quarters, the falls in house prices were concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne. In the September quarter, the falls were more widespread, with other capitals except Adelaide (where prices were broadly flat) also showing falls in prices. In Brisbane, where prices were still rising earlier in the year, all four available measures now show falls in the September quarter. There is less information available for Perth and Canberra, but it also suggests significant falls.", "Nationwide prices of apartments show a similar pattern of subdued outturns in 2004 following strong growth in 2003 (Graph 28). Estimates of price changes in the September quarter are mixed but point to a continuation of relatively weak market conditions.", "Although they represent only a small proportion of total sales, auction results suggest that demand remains subdued in the housing market, despite a modest pick-up in clearance rates from their trough in mid 2004 (Graph 29). Likewise, auction volumes have shown tentative signs of recovery, though in Sydney and Melbourne they remain around half the level recorded in previous years.", "Conditions in the business sector overall remain strong. Business sentiment and investment intentions are above historical norms, profitability is at a high level and the global economic expansion is beginning to provide some impetus to growth in trade-exposed industries.", "Production in the non-farm economy continued to grow at a solid pace in the June quarter, while farm output fell, with its recovery from the drought-induced trough of 2002/03 now largely complete. In the non-farm economy, domestically oriented industries have maintained their strong growth performance of recent years, supported by continued strength in construction activity, retail trade and a recovery in business services (Graph 30). A pick-up in growth in trade-exposed industries reflects a recent increase in export-oriented manufacturing and transport, while the earlier subtraction from mining has dissipated as temporary disruptions to supply have been resolved. However, surveys suggest that further progress in the rebalancing of growth is likely to occur fairly slowly.", "Most business surveys continue to report highly favourable conditions in the non-farm sector, particularly in those industries sensitive to domestic demand. According to the NAB survey, business conditions edged higher in the September quarter to remain well above their long-term average, and close to their highest level in the past decade (Graph 31). Respondents reported high levels of employment, profitability and trading conditions. Capacity utilisation approached the highest levels recorded for this series, while labour availability remained a constraint. In contrast, exports were reportedly relatively subdued, a common theme across a number of surveys, though they have picked up in the September quarter. Looking ahead, businesses expect an export recovery underpinned by strong demand for resources.", "The ACCI-Westpac and the AIG surveys of the manufacturing sector paint a similar picture, with business confidence and most indicators of activity at or above long-run average levels, though in both of these surveys respondents have scaled back their expectations of the likely extent of the export recovery. The Sensis Business Index, which covers small and medium-sized businesses, reported business confidence in trading conditions over the next 12 months at the highest level in the 11-year history of the survey, with high levels of employment, profitability and capital expenditure.", "Corporate profitability remains exceptionally high, with the gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations running at its highest share of GDP in over four decades. Corporate profits grew strongly in the June quarter to be 16\u00bd per cent higher over the year, reflecting a recovery in the profits of some trade-exposed industries, predominantly mining, which has benefited from rising commodity prices and strong world demand. Following a string of strong outturns, profits in the domestically oriented sectors appear to have moderated somewhat in the June quarter, though they remain solid. Profits of unincorporated enterprises fell in the June quarter, but were significantly higher over the year, mainly reflecting developments in the farm sector. Looking forward, both business surveys and equity markets suggest that strong profits growth is expected to persist.", "The high level of corporate profitability continues to provide firms with substantial internal funds to pursue their investment plans. In addition, the corporate sector also has access to ample external funding. Over the year to September, business credit grew by 9 per cent and non-intermediated debt increased by 11 per cent, while equity raisings were broadly in line with their average over the past five years.", "After contracting in the March quarter 2004, business investment grew by around 4\u00bd per cent in the June quarter, to be 10 per cent higher over the year. The June quarter outcome was driven by a strong rebound in equipment investment. Investment in computer software also increased notably in the quarter, continuing the recovery from a period of weakness, though growth remains slower than recorded during the late 1990s boom. Investment in buildings and structures fell slightly in the June quarter, reflecting a sizeable fall in engineering construction activity (as some major projects were completed), which more than offset a strong rise in non-residential building activity.", "The latest capital expenditure (Capex) survey points to solid growth in business investment in 2004/05, underpinned by strong planned expenditure on buildings and structures. Intentions for machinery and equipment investment, adjusted by a five-year average realisation ratio, suggest modest growth in real terms following a period of rapid growth over the past three years. Investment in equipment is expected to be supported by growth in the finance and insurance industry, consistent with the buoyant outlook for the business services sector signalled by surveys of businesses and liaison. Furthermore, the Rabobank survey reports that equipment investment in the farm sector \u2013 which is not included in the Capex survey \u2013 is likely to be strong over the year ahead at around pre-drought levels.", "Other forward-looking indicators also suggest continued near-term strength in non-residential construction (Graph 32). Activity is expected to be supported by the backlog of engineering work yet to be done, with more than two quarters' worth of work still to be completed, and much road and resource-related engineering work scheduled for commencement. However, the near-term outlook for non-residential building is less favourable; while the value of work approved increased by 13.4 per cent in the September quarter, the volume of work approved earlier in 2004 fell well below that recorded in 2003. Moreover, rising construction costs may threaten the viability of some building projects currently in the planning stages.", "Labour market conditions have remained firm in recent months. Employment grew by 2.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter, exceeding the average pace of employment growth for the past decade of 2 per cent. Most of the growth over the year has been in full-time employment, although part-time work also picked up in the quarter (Graph 33). This recent strength follows an apparent lull in employment growth between April and August which the ABS has since partly attributed to sampling problems.", "Having declined over most of the past financial year, the unemployment rate has been fairly stable in recent months at a level close to the lows reached in 1981 and 1989 (Graph 34). Broader measures of labour underutilisation have also fallen, though they point to slightly less tightness in the labour market than suggested by the unemployment rate (see Box B: \u2018Indicators of Labour Market Tightness\u2019). The participation rate has remained around 63\u00bd per cent over the past few months, consistent with its average of the past few years.", "Employment has increased in all states over the year to the September quarter, though outcomes were varied around the country (Table 9). The strongest growth was seen in Queensland, reflecting the rapid expansion in final demand in that state. In contrast, employment growth continues to be subdued in South Australia and below average in New South Wales. Consistent with the expansion of employment, unemployment rates have declined in most states over the past year. Queensland recorded a particularly sharp fall, as did Western Australia, which has an unemployment rate well below that in other parts of the country. Despite solid employment growth over the past year, Victoria's unemployment rate has picked up noticeably. This has been associated with increased labour force participation among both males and females.", "Forward-looking indicators of labour demand continue to point to solid employment growth in the near term (Graph 35). The ABS measure of job vacancies has grown strongly over the past year, as have various internet-based vacancy series. And while print-based indicators have remained relatively flat over the past year, recent business surveys suggest that hiring intentions remain well above long-run average levels.", "The current account deficit has been broadly unchanged over the past year and a half, as a sharp rise in the terms of trade has been accompanied by strong growth in import volumes and only a modest recovery in export volumes. More recently, growth in imports appears to have moderated from the unsustainable pace seen around the start of the year, while the expansion in export volumes has remained weaker than might have been expected given the pick-up in global demand and in world commodity prices since mid last year (Graph 36). The trade deficit in the September quarter 2004 is estimated at around 3 per cent of GDP, while the current account deficit is likely to have remained around the 6 per cent of GDP range that has prevailed in recent quarters (Graph 37).", "Export earnings have increased over the past year by around 14 per cent, driven by rising export prices and a recovery in rural and services export volumes (Graph 38). Export earnings increased slightly in the September quarter. With a modest depreciation of the Australian dollar and higher world commodity prices in the September quarter, export prices rose significantly, suggesting that volumes fell in the quarter.", "The value of rural exports has increased strongly from the trough associated with the drought, rising by around 34 per cent over the year to the September quarter. This increase has been mostly driven by a rise in volumes, particularly of cereals, following the record 2003/04 winter crop. However, it appears that the recovery in rural exports has largely run its course, with a fall in value terms in the September quarter together with an increase in prices, implying a quarterly fall in export volumes. Looking ahead, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) expects the current winter crop to be lower than in 2003/04, but still above average levels. Some downside risk to this forecast remains because spring rainfall has been insufficient in some areas. ABARE expects that herd rebuilding will restrain growth in beef production and exports, while the volume of exports of other livestock-based products is expected to expand modestly. The chance of an El Ni\u00f1o event re-emerging remains a downside risk to rural production over the coming year. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the situation remains \u2018delicately balanced\u2019 with some, but not all, indicators at levels characteristic of an El Ni\u00f1o event.", "The value of resource exports has risen sharply over the past year or so, and continued to rise solidly in the September quarter, but this was entirely a price effect owing to strength in commodity prices, even when measured in Australian dollars. The weakness in export volumes continues a trend that has been apparent over the past few years, reflecting supply disruptions and capacity constraints, especially for mineral fuels and coal. Nevertheless, as was discussed in the previous Statement, the outlook for growth of resource exports over the next year or two is positive, given that liaison continues to indicate strong external demand for resources. The completion of a number of mineral and energy projects and infrastructure expansions is also expected to boost production and transport capacity. These include the 4th LNG production train at the North-West Shelf and recently commissioned oil fields in the Pilbara region and the Timor Sea. The resumption of production at the Moomba plant is also likely to contribute to a moderate rise in oil exports.", "After picking up strongly in the first half of 2004, the value of manufactured exports declined by around 2 per cent in the September quarter, to be broadly unchanged over the past year. Export volumes also appear to have fallen in the quarter, since trade price data suggest that the prices received for manufactures rose. Growth in manufactured exports continues to lag the pick-up in activity among our trading partners. According to the AIG Survey of Manufacturing and liaison with firms, this appears to reflect strong competition in export markets and a loss of competitiveness over recent years owing to the appreciation of the Australian dollar since 2001. In addition, some firms are likely to have been directing production towards the domestic market given the strength of domestic demand. There is nonetheless a positive outlook for manufactured exports with strong trading partner growth and the exchange rate down from its peak near the start of 2004, though growth is likely to be more moderate than during the 1990s.", "The value of services exports grew by about 1 per cent in the September quarter and is at a relatively high level, in line with recent strength in short-term visitor arrivals. The outlook for services exports is favourable, supported by the ongoing global economic upswing, and tourism industry contacts remain positive about prospects for the period ahead.", "Growth in import volumes has moderated over recent quarters, following a strong expansion over the second half of 2003, and a surge in the March quarter 2004 that saw annual growth in import volumes of 16 per cent (Graph 36). The earlier strength in imports was broadly based across all categories of goods and services, and was driven by robust growth in domestic demand and low import prices flowing from the appreciation of the Australian dollar in 2002 and 2003. However, the growth of imports slowed in the June quarter and appears to have moderated further in the September quarter. The value of imports rose by 2\u00be per cent in the September quarter, with volumes likely to have been broadly unchanged. The recent easing in the pace of growth of import volumes comes after a period when it was unusually high, and is a response to the slowing in domestic demand in the first half of 2004 and the depreciation of the Australian dollar from its February 2004 peak.", "Commodity prices have continued to increase strongly. The RBA Index of Commodity Prices rose by 2.1 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to October, supported by rising prices of base metals and other resources, and is around 16 per cent higher than a year ago (Graph 39, Table 10). Commodity prices in Australian dollar terms have also increased slightly of late, rising by 0.2 per cent over the past three months, to remain close to the elevated levels seen during 2001\u20132002.", "Base metals prices increased by 3.4 per cent over the three months to October to reach a new high for the current cycle, although much of the latest increase had been unwound by early November. The pick-up in prices in late September, which was partly attributed to an easing of fears about a pronounced slowdown in China, proved unsustainable, though prices have remained close to recent peaks. Strong global demand has ensured that markets remain tight; reported stocks of aluminium and copper have fallen recently, and copper stocks, in particular, are currently at low levels. The price of copper has also been supported by supply disruptions from strikes in Spain and Chile.", "Prices for bulk commodities, particularly for steaming coal, have continued to rise. Steaming coal prices in US dollar terms increased by 9.2 per cent over the three months to September, and are more than 60 per cent higher over 2004 to date, in line with the large contract price increases achieved earlier in the year. Similarly, US-dollar coking coal prices rose by 3.0 per cent over the three months to September, and have risen by close to 33 per cent over the year so far. While spot prices for steaming coal have recently eased from previous highs, they remain well above the contract prices set earlier in the year. Spot prices have been supported by ongoing strength in demand, which bodes well for the forthcoming contract price negotiations for 2005/06.", "The strength of world demand has also been a factor helping to drive up oil prices. As discussed in detail in the chapter on \u2018International Economic Developments\u2019, US-dollar oil prices have risen by around 75 per cent over the past year. This is likely to put upward pressure on other energy prices that are in the RBA Index. Similarly, the price of gold has risen over the past three months, driven partly by the recent gains in oil prices and the decline in the value of the US dollar against the euro.", "Movements in rural commodity prices have been more mixed over the past three months, as higher beef and sugar prices have been largely offset by lower prices for barley, cotton and wool. Beef prices have remained high as a result of ongoing strong demand in the US and the BSE-related ban on imports of US beef into Japan, though these restrictions have eased recently. In contrast, barley and cotton prices have fallen as a result of improving prospects for sizeable expansions in global production.", "The ongoing strength in commodity prices, particularly for coal, has continued to support Australia's terms of trade. After an increase in the terms of trade to the highest level in almost 30 years in the June quarter, the terms of trade are estimated to have increased further in the September quarter (Graph 40).", "Long-term bond yields have fallen since the time of the previous Statement. Yields on 10-year government bonds are now around 5.4 per cent, about 30 basis points below levels in early August and around 65 basis points below their recent peak in mid June. Yields on 10-year inflation-linked bonds have fallen by a similar amount and, at 2.8 per cent, are close to their lowest recorded levels (Graph 41).", "While long-term yields have been affected by domestic news at times, the main factor behind their fall has been developments in overseas bond markets. Concern that rising oil prices may dampen the global recovery appears to have weighed on US yields which, in turn, have led local yields lower. With longer-term yields moving broadly in line with those in the US since early August, the spread between Australian and US 10-year yields has moved in a fairly narrow range around 130 basis points.", "The recent falls in bond yields have seen the spread between yields on 10-year government bonds and the cash rate narrow to 15 basis points, well below its long-run average. Yields on bonds with maturities out to four years are below the cash rate. A yield curve of this shape normally suggests that the market attaches a greater probability to the cash rate falling than rising. While this would be consistent with a view that rising oil prices will cause nominal economic activity to slow significantly, it is at odds with other indicators of cash rate expectations and suggests, to some observers, a degree of speculative overvaluation in the domestic bond market.", "A clearer measure of the market's expectations for the cash rate over the next year or so can be gauged from short-dated instruments such as overnight indexed swaps. While these instruments suggest the market has indeed scaled back its expectations of a further tightening of domestic monetary policy, they do not suggest the market expects the cash rate to fall. Rather, the market expects the cash rate to most likely remain at its current level over the next year or so (Graph 42).", "The pricing of credit risk also supports the view that financial markets do not expect a significant slowing in economic activity. Credit risk perceptions, as measured by spreads on corporate bonds and credit default swaps, have changed little over the past few months and remain low by historical standards, indicating that markets see the continuation of favourable trading conditions for corporations.", "Intermediaries' variable indicator lending rates have not changed since the last Statement, consistent with there having been no change in the target cash rate. Interest rates on fixed-rate housing and small business loans declined over the same period, in line with a decrease in the cost of funding these loans (Graph 43). As is typical, fixed rates on small business loans followed the movement in funding costs most closely, with the major banks' average 3-year rate falling by around 25 basis points since early August.", "Housing fixed rates, which tend to be adjusted less frequently than the fixed rates on small business loans, have fallen since late September, following a period of around seven months when they were largely unchanged. The major banks' average 3-year fixed housing rate is currently 6.65 per cent, around 30 basis points lower than in the months beforehand and around 40 basis points below the standard variable rate (Table 11 and Graph 44).", "According to the latest available data, demand for fixed-rate housing loans remains relatively low. In the three months to August, the share of new owner-occupier housing loans taken out at fixed rates was steady at around 7 per cent, compared with an average share of 9 per cent over the past five years and a recent peak of 15 per cent a year ago, when monetary policy was being tightened (Graph 44). Use of fixed-rate loans is higher among small businesses but has been in trend decline for a number of years.", "Australian share prices have risen by 8 per cent since the last Statement and reached new record highs during the period (Graph 45). The rise in the Australian equity market has been greater than that in most other industrialised countries. It has also been broad-based, although companies in the industrials, consumer staples and, until recently, energy sectors performed most strongly. Price increases in the energy sector were driven by the strength in oil prices, while developments in the other two sectors reflected a combination of strong profit results and acquisitions activity.", "The ASX 200 index is currently 10 per cent above its previous high in March 2002, largely because of the strong performance of the materials and energy sectors over the past couple of years. In contrast, prices in the consumer discretionary, health care, telecoms and IT sectors remain at least 25 per cent below their own record highs (Graph 46).", "Despite the strong performance of the Australian equity market in recent months, valuation measures have not deteriorated: the price/earnings ratio has fallen over 2004, reflecting the strong results reported for the 2003/04 financial year, and is now only a little above its long-run average; the dividend yield, while down a bit over recent months, remains in line with its average over the past 10 years and compares favourably with the average level of real bond yields in recent years; and equity analysts' earnings forecasts, of around 8 per cent per annum over the next three to five years, are lower than the average of recent years (Graph 47).", "Australian non-government entities issued $40 billion of bonds in the September quarter, continuing the strong issuance seen earlier in 2004. Issuance by financial institutions and asset-backed vehicles was lower in the September quarter, consistent with some moderation in housing credit, but non-financial corporates' issuance, which had been relatively subdued during the first half of 2004, picked up (Table 12).", "In both domestic and offshore markets, Australian entities' gross bond issuance in 2004 has already exceeded that seen in previous full years (Graph 48). Factors behind this strength include both the need to fund the strong growth in household credit, notwithstanding its recent moderation, and strong demand by investors for bonds, especially in light of continued tightness in government debt markets.", "Non-resident issuers have also issued more Australian dollar bonds in the first 10 months of 2004 than in any previous year, prompted by demand for higher-quality bonds and favourable basis swap spreads.", "As well as record issuance, 2004 has seen further signs of deepening of the domestic bond market. The past quarter has seen a broader range of issuers come to the market and a greater ability to issue in larger amounts or for longer maturities. The broadening in the range of issuers reflects in part the prospective change to the composition of the major bond indexes against which many funds managers benchmark themselves, to include BBB-rated bonds for the first time.", "Issuance of hybrid securities (instruments with features of both equities and debt) has increased recently, with $2.9 billion of such securities issued since the previous Statement. The type of securities being issued has changed in recent months, with new issues being predominantly perpetual securities that contain conversion options for the issuers and a higher interest rate if the option is not exercised. Previously, the securities often contained conversion options for the investor as well as the issuer. The change appears to have been precipitated by the forthcoming adoption of international accounting standards, which have more restrictions on the type of securities that can be classified as equity and hence qualify as Tier 1 capital.", "Net equity raisings totalled $4.2 billion in the September quarter, roughly in line with the quarterly average since the start of 2000. Although a higher-than-average number of companies listed in the September quarter, the amount of capital raised through IPOs ($1.2 billion) was only in line with its quarterly average for the past couple of years (Graph 49). Listings by companies in the materials and energy sectors accounted for almost 40 per cent of the total number of listings. Other (gross) equity raisings totalled $4 billion, and was dominated by NAB's $1.2 billion dividend reinvestment plan. Buyback activity was weak in the September quarter, but is expected to increase in the December quarter following announcements of large off-market buybacks by BHP Billiton and Telstra.", "Financial conditions continue to be accommodative of domestic economic growth. The cash rate has remained at 5.25 per cent since December last year, a level slightly below its average over the past decade. Credit growth, while having eased back from its very rapid pace of late last year, remains strong. On balance, most other financial indicators also suggest that financial conditions remain supportive for both the household and business sectors.", "Total credit increased at an annualised rate of 14 per cent over the six months to September 2004 (Table 13 and Graph 50). While this rate of growth is down from the brisk pace of late 2003, it is still above the average of recent years. The slowing has been attributable to a slowing in household credit, which has been partly offset by stronger business credit.", "While the growth of household credit continues to decline, it remains high at an annualised rate of 14 per cent over the six months to September. Most of this decline is accounted for by a fall in housing credit growth which, at an annualised rate of 15 per cent over the six months to September, is some 8 percentage points below the peak reached in December last year. The fall in terms of three-month-ended growth rates is somewhat larger, reflecting both the very high monthly growth rates at the end of 2003 and declining growth rates during 2004 (see the chapter on \u2018Domestic Economic Conditions\u2019 for further discussion). Growth in personal credit for purposes other than housing has also slowed from its recent peak, though the moderation is not as marked as it is for housing.", "The decline in the growth of housing credit over the year reflects a significant drop in housing loan approvals from the peak reached in late 2003, with much of the fall occurring over the turn of the year. Since then, loan approvals for investment properties have continued to fall, while loan approvals for owner-occupied housing have risen. These offsetting influences have resulted in a fairly flat profile for aggregate housing loan approvals in 2004. The most recent loan approvals data appear to be consistent with housing credit growth remaining relatively high in the near term at rates close to those of recent months.", "In contrast to the slowing in household credit, the pace of business credit growth has picked up over the course of the past six months. Business credit grew at an annualised rate of around 12 per cent over the six months to September, bringing it above rates seen in late 2003. Business loan approvals are also at a very high level, suggesting that businesses are having little difficulty in obtaining new finance from financial institutions.", "Consistent with the unchanged cash rate, household and business variable lending rates have remained unchanged during 2004, at just below their averages of the past decade (Graph 51). As discussed in the \u2018Domestic                          Financial Markets\u2019 chapter, longer-term bond yields have been edging lower, with three, five and 10-year bond yields all falling to levels close to, or even below, the current cash rate. Typically a decline in longer-term yields relative to the cash rate would be interpreted as a sign that monetary policy had become less accommodative. However, in the current situation, developments in foreign bond markets, particularly in the US, appear to have driven longer-term Australian yields lower.", "Other indicators of financial conditions suggest that, on balance, monetary policy remains mildly accommodative. The real cash rate is likely to have declined given that measures of inflation expectations have risen while the cash rate has been unchanged over the past few months. In real terms, the trade-weighted exchange rate has risen slightly over recent months, to be about 10 per cent above its average over the post-float period (Graph 52). However, this has been accompanied by further gains in the terms of trade to a level that is about 20 per cent above its post-float average.", "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.4 per cent in the September quarter to be 2.3 per cent higher over the year (Graph 53). Petrol prices increased by 3.3 per cent in the September quarter and by 12 per cent over the year, contributing significantly to CPI inflation. Excluding petrol, the CPI increased by 0.3 per cent in the September quarter. Based on a range of measures, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation over the year to September was slightly lower than CPI inflation (Table 14).", "The most noteworthy aspects of inflation outcomes over the past year or so have been the decline in the price of tradable items (excluding food and petrol) following the earlier appreciation of the exchange rate, while non-tradable prices have continued to rise relatively quickly. In the September quarter, the prices of tradable items declined slightly, with further falls in prices of motor vehicles and audio-visual equipment. It appears, however, that the disinflationary impact of the earlier appreciation of the exchange rate is waning, with the rate of decline in tradable prices (excluding food and petrol) moderating in year-ended terms (Graph 54).", "Price rises in a number of non-tradable goods and services have made a sizeable contribution to CPI inflation. Non-tradable inflation was 0.9 per cent in the September quarter, with ongoing pressure in house purchase costs, though these have eased from the very strong rates of a year ago. There were also further strong price rises for a range of administered items such as property rates and utilities. In year-ended terms, non-tradable inflation was 3.6 per cent in the September quarter, down from 4.1 per cent in the June quarter.", "Producer price figures for the September quarter suggest that upstream price pressures are building at all stages of production. The prices of outputs from the final stage of domestic production rose strongly in the quarter \u2013 underpinned by significant increases in the prices of building construction, utilities and petroleum refining \u2013 to be 4.5 per cent higher over the year (Table 15 and Graph 55). Similarly, import prices at the final stage of production recorded a solid rise in the quarter, reflecting the influence of higher oil prices and broad-based increases in the prices of manufactured items. Excluding the effects of oil, the price of outputs from the final stage of production rose by 2.8 per cent over the year. These outcomes for domestic and import prices were consistent with liaison that suggests that the disinflationary impetus from the appreciation of the exchange rate in 2002 and 2003 has abated. For outputs at the earlier stages of production, the effects of large increases in commodity prices, particularly for oil, iron and steel, have resulted in large quarterly increases in prices in the September and June quarters.", "The pick-up in output prices in the September quarter was most evident in the manufacturing and transport & storage sectors, which faced sizeable increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel. While construction output prices rose somewhat less rapidly than in recent quarters, they have risen by more than 7 per cent over the year, reflecting persistent labour cost pressures as well as significant increases in material costs. There have been particularly large increases for steel prices, which are likely to rise further in coming months as major contracts are renewed.", "While the demand for labour remains firm, there is little sign at this stage of the emergence of heightened wage pressures across the economy as a whole. The Wage Cost Index (WCI) increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, once again slightly less than expected, to be 3.6 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 56). Public-sector wage growth eased somewhat, but was still above that of the private sector, where wages grew by 3.4 per cent over the past year. Stronger wage outcomes were evident in the construction sector, consistent with reports of skills shortages, particularly in non-residential construction.", "Other indicators also show broadly unchanged wage pressures on an economy-wide basis. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations reports that the average annualised wage increase certified in new enterprise bargaining agreements fell slightly to 3.8 per cent in the June quarter from 4.1 per cent in the March quarter. There was no change recorded in the average wage increase for the stock of existing agreements, which remained at 3.9 per cent. More timely data from the NAB Quarterly Business Survey suggest that labour costs have continued to build gradually, increasing by 3 per cent over the year to September, while expected labour cost pressures have remained steady. According to the Mercer Quarterly Salary Review, annual growth in the base salaries of executives rose to 4.8 per cent in the year to September, among the higher outcomes of recent years.", "While economy-wide measures of wages growth have remained relatively stable, localised pressures are certainly evident in some official wage measures as well as through liaison, which points to substantial increases in wages for skilled employees in the construction and resource sectors, and in some areas of business services. Firms are also reporting strong growth in non-wage labour costs, including sub-contractor payments for self-employed workers, bonus payments to employees, and training for new (and typically less skilled) employees. These developments are consistent with survey data showing that firms are finding it increasingly difficult to attract suitably skilled labour, pointing to the possibility of stronger wage pressures emerging in the period ahead. (See Box B: \u2018Indicators of Labour Market Tightness\u2019 for further discussion.)", "Measures of inflation expectations suggest that most observers expect inflation to rise gradually over the next two years from the moderate levels currently prevailing (Table 16). The Bank's survey of market economists showed that their median forecast for CPI inflation over this financial year was unchanged from last quarter. They continue to expect an increase in inflation over longer horizons, albeit a more modest one than had been anticipated last quarter. Union officials' median expectations of inflation were unchanged; they expect inflation to rise gradually through to mid 2005 before stabilising.", "The inflation expectations implied by financial market prices have also been broadly unchanged over the past six months. According to the difference between nominal and indexed bond yields, the market expects inflation over the medium term of around 2.6 per cent (Graph 57). However, relative to a year earlier, inflation expectations have shifted moderately higher.", "The inflation expectations of consumers have been relatively stable despite significant increases in oil prices and the consequent rises in petrol prices. The Melbourne Institute survey reported that the median expectation for consumer price inflation in October remained close to its average level of the past six months. There has, however, been some pick-up in the inflation expectations of businesses. The NAB survey reported that the pace of economy-wide and retail product price inflation rose in the September quarter and is expected to remain around current levels in the December quarter. Similar outcomes are apparent in the quarterly AIG survey of manufacturers.", "CPI inflation of 2.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter was down marginally from the previous quarter, with most underlying measures running slightly below the headline rate. Over the past couple of years, the trend in underlying inflation has been one of gradual decline, reflecting the impact of the exchange rate appreciation that took place during 2002 and 2003. However, with this effect now waning, underlying inflation is expected to remain around current levels before rising gradually from early next year to around 2\u00bd per cent towards the end of 2005 and to around 2\u00be per cent by mid 2006. While this profile is broadly in line with that presented at the time of the previous Statement, it is noteworthy that the expected trough in inflation is not as low as had been forecast at the beginning of the year, when both headline and underlying measures were forecast to decline to a trough of around 1\u00bd per cent near the end of 2004. This partly reflects the fact that the exchange rate has depreciated since early 2004.", "Domestic inflationary risks appear to be tilted somewhat to the upside. Producer price data, business surveys and liaison indicate that upstream inflationary pressures, both from materials and labour costs, are building.", "Another important consideration is the outlook for oil prices. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the current level of oil prices will not be maintained and prices will fall to around US$45 per barrel in a year or so, broadly in line with market expectations. The rise to date has had a direct impact on CPI inflation in the September quarter, and it is likely that petrol will make a further significant contribution to CPI inflation in the near term. This is expected to keep year-ended CPI inflation above underlying inflation over the next few quarters, with the two measures converging thereafter. However, if oil prices are sustained at, or rise above, recent high levels, headline CPI inflation would be higher than currently forecast. This could also mean a greater potential for second-round effects, particularly given the strong conditions in labour and product markets. However, to the extent that higher oil prices persist and have a significant dampening impact on the global economy, they would also tend to reduce domestic growth and consequently place some downward pressure on underlying inflation.", "Global foreign exchange market turnover rose sharply in the three years between April 2001 and April 2004.[1] In part this represented a return to more normal rates of activity from a subdued level of trading in 2001. At that time, the US dollar bubble was at its peak, and was associated with a buy-and-hold strategy toward US dollar denominated assets. The search for yield has also boosted general interest in foreign exchange as an asset class for investors, and the Australian dollar has benefited more than others, reflecting the positive yield differential available. Hence while turnover has risen noticeably in all markets and in all currencies, the rise in activity in both the Australian dollar and the Australian market was noticeably stronger than the global average. The valuation effects of the rise in the exchange rate from just under US50 cents in April 2001 to around US75 cents in April 2004 were also important in explaining the increase in turnover reported in US dollar terms.", "The AUD/USD is now the fourth most traded currency pair in the world, with trading in the euro/USD the highest, followed by the yen/USD and pound sterling against the US dollar (Graph A1). Average daily global turnover of the Australian dollar against the US dollar has increased from US$47 billion to US$90 billion, which places the currency pair ahead of trading in other major currencies such as the Swiss franc and Canadian dollar against the US dollar. About one-third of this turnover in the Australian dollar occurred in Australia, with the rest spread across the major foreign exchange centres around the globe.", "Total foreign exchange turnover in Australia (taking into account not only trading in Australian dollars but also other currencies) also recorded a substantial rise in total turnover in 2004, from US$52 billion per day in 2001 to US$81 billion (Table A1). On these figures the Australian market is the seventh largest in the world and the fourth largest in the Asia-Pacific region.", "Turnover in the domestic market remains evenly divided between transactions involving the Australian dollar and those that do not. Of note is the increased turnover in trades involving the euro. This is in line with the growing importance of the euro in other major trading centres, and in part reflects that the euro was still a relatively new currency in 2001 but it has since gained more widespread acceptance. A greater commitment to the Australian market from several large European investment banks that trade out of Sydney has also boosted euro turnover in Australia.", "Spot transactions in the foreign exchange market have risen by 93 per cent in Australia since the previous survey, while turnover in both forwards and foreign exchange swaps was up by 43 per cent. Transactions between resident dealers and overseas banks were one of the driving forces behind the rise. Anecdotal evidence gathered domestically, and supported by findings of other central banks, suggests that the increased participation of hedge funds may have been a major contributor to the rise in turnover. Hedge funds were increasingly noted as taking speculative positions in foreign exchange in recent years, and were also more active than previously in hedging their currency exposures on underlying investments.", "The strong employment growth of recent years has seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.6 per cent, which is close to the previous lows of the past 25 years. While a low unemployment rate is generally indicative of relatively tight labour market conditions, it is not a definitive measure; labour scarcity will also depend on other factors such as the availability of existing workers to work more hours, the potential for people currently measured as outside the labour force to enter, and the extent of skill matching between the available supply and demand for labour. This box looks at a range of indicators of labour market conditions that take some of these factors into account.", "One factor affecting the availability of labour that is not captured by the unemployment rate is the degree of underemployment, which refers to the willingness of employed people (both full-time and part-time) to work more than their current hours. This increased substantially during the early 1990s, with strong growth in part-time workers actively looking for additional work (Graph B1). There is also a significant number of underemployed full-time workers, though these have been more stable as a share of the labour force. Adding these two categories to the unemployment rate would produce a crude measure of underutilisation, but it would tend to be an overestimate because it is likely that an underemployed worker may want only a few extra hours of work each week, while an unemployed person may want full-time work. Instead, it makes sense to calculate an underutilisation measure by weighting each underutilised person by an estimate of the additional hours that they want to work (Graph B2). This measure is close to, but still above its previous cyclical lows, suggesting that the labour market may not currently be quite as tight as implied by the unemployment rate.", "Another source of potential labour supply is the 35\u201340 per cent of the working-age population which is not measured as being in the labour force. Some proportion of these people report that they are willing to work but are not actively searching for work or are not available to start work immediately, and are known as \u2018marginally attached workers\u2019. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggest that marginally attached workers have increased as a proportion of the working-age population outside the labour force over the 1980s and early 1990s, and currently represent more than 20 per cent of this group. This increase has been associated with a trend decline in the participation of males.[1]", "It is not possible to predict how far the unemployment rate might be able to fall before tightness in the labour market leads to significantly stronger economy-wide wage pressures. For a number of reasons, it is possible that wage pressures are now lower at any given unemployment rate than they would have been in the past. First, there is the rise in underutilisation and marginally attached workers discussed above. Second, industrial relations reforms since the late 1980s have resulted in more decentralised wage-setting arrangements, limiting the extent to which wage pressures emerging in areas facing relatively tight labour market conditions are transmitted to other parts of the economy. A third, and reinforcing development is the trend towards longer-duration wage contracts, reflecting the anchoring of inflation expectations at a low level.", "Nevertheless, business surveys suggest that a broad range of firms are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable labour (Graph B3). These survey-based indicators are likely to be influenced both by the overall quantity of labour supply and the extent to which the skills of available workers match the needs of employers. Both the NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys suggest that the difficulty in obtaining suitable labour has moved into the upper end of the range recorded over the past two decades."]}}, {"Date": "Statement on Monetary Policy \u2013 February 2021", "Text": {"5. Economic Outlook": ["The outlook for the global economy has improved since the November Statement on Monetary Policy. While the global recovery lost a little momentum late last year after a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in some economies, a number of vaccines have been approved and vaccinations have begun. Fiscal and monetary policy also remain very expansionary and, in some economies, fiscal support may increase further in the period ahead. The pace of the recovery will continue to vary across economies and, in many, the recovery will remain incomplete over the forecast period. Underlying inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued globally for some time given considerable spare capacity.", "Growth in Australia's major trading partners is expected to be a little stronger than at the time of the November Statement (see \u2018The International Environment\u2019 chapter). Part of this upgrade stems from a better starting point: activity in Australia's major trading partners was generally stronger than expected in the September quarter and recent virus outbreaks do not appear to have fully offset this. The outlook for Australia's major trading partners is a little stronger than for the rest of the world because some large trading partners \u2013 China and a few advanced east Asian economies \u2013 have been successful in suppressing infections and are benefiting from a strong recovery in their merchandise exports.", "The recovery in the domestic economy has been sustained over recent months, supported by better health outcomes and a further expansion in monetary and fiscal policy in the second half of last year. In the baseline scenario, forecasts for GDP and employment growth have been upgraded relative to the November Statement, largely reflecting a stronger starting point for the forecasts. As a result, GDP and employment are expected to reach their pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2021, around 6\u201312 months earlier than previously expected. The unemployment rate is likely to have already peaked and is now expected to decline steadily to around 5\u00bc per cent by mid 2023.", "Although these are materially better outcomes than previously expected, the level of GDP is still expected to remain below that forecast at the time of the February 2020 Statement. This partly reflects a smaller population; in per capita terms, the shortfall in GDP is less pronounced but still material. Spare capacity in the labour market is expected to remain elevated over the forecast period, and both wages growth and underlying inflation are expected to remain below 2 per cent.", "The economy is now transitioning beyond the initial \u2018snapback\u2019 phase, which was underpinned by favourable health outcomes, the faster-than-expected lifting of activity restrictions and very substantial policy support. The nature and speed of the next phase of the domestic recovery remains uncertain and is expected to be uneven for some time yet. Beyond the risks associated with the virus, a key uncertainty is how Australian households and businesses respond and adapt to the tapering of some fiscal and other temporary support measures in coming quarters following the extraordinary boost to cash flows they received last year.", "The baseline scenario assumes that no further large outbreaks of COVID-19 and accompanying hard lockdowns occur within Australia and that restrictions, when imposed, are brief. The domestic vaccination program is assumed to proceed in line with government guidance, and the international border is assumed to remain closed until the end of 2021. Under this scenario, GDP is expected to have contracted by around 2 per cent over the year to December 2020, but then grow by around 3\u00bd per cent over both 2021 and 2022. Inflation is expected to pick up a little alongside the gradual decline in the unemployment rate, to be 1\u00be per cent by mid 2023.", "Given the high degree of uncertainty around the outlook, 2 alternative scenarios (upside and downside) are considered to assess the potential economic impact of different health outcomes. In summary:", "The stronger-than-expected recovery in the second half of last year is primarily responsible for lifting the forecast level of GDP by around 1\u00bd per cent across the forecast period. GDP is now expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of this year. The faster-than-expected removal of social distancing restrictions and recent policy measures are assessed to have pulled forward GDP growth from 2021 into the latter part of 2020, although GDP growth in 2022 is still broadly unchanged (at a higher level) relative to the November Statement (Table 5.1; Graph 5.1).", "The recovery in household spending and an increase in public demand led the initial rebound in activity and are expected to be the main contributors to GDP growth over coming quarters. A pick-up in business investment is anticipated to lag the recovery in other components of private demand. Many firms are expected to fully utilise their existing capacity before embarking on large scale investments during a period of unusually high uncertainty.", "Labour market outcomes in the December quarter were much stronger than expected at the time of the November Statement. Employment and labour force participation have recovered more quickly than anticipated, and the unemployment rate declined further to 6.6 per cent in December. These outcomes suggest the peak in the unemployment rate has already occurred, and at a much lower level than expected earlier in the pandemic (Graph 5.2).", "The improved near-term outlook means the expected recovery in employment and total hours has been front-loaded, with both of these aggregates returning to their pre-pandemic levels by late 2021 (Graph 5.3). The key driver of the faster recovery in the labour market has been the stronger-than-expected rebound in activity over the second half of 2020. The return to employment of people who had temporarily exited the workforce has also occurred more rapidly than expected; industries most affected by activity restrictions were those with typically higher turnover rates, meaning rehiring could happen faster. The quick rebound in participation suggests that there has been less labour market scarring and fewer search frictions than is typically seen in labour market downturns and recoveries. It also implies that there are fewer workers still out of the labour force waiting to rejoin, which reduces the likelihood of a material increase in the unemployment rate being driven by people returning to the labour force.", "The JobKeeper program winds down at the end of March, which creates some uncertainty for the overall pace of employment growth in the first part of the year. Employment is then expected to continue growing over the forecast period, underpinned by the ongoing expansion, but at a slower pace than previously anticipated given much of the expected recovery has already occurred.", "The decline in the unemployment rate is expected to slow in the next quarter or two as JobKeeper finishes. From mid 2021, and consistent with the outlook for employment growth, the unemployment rate continues to move gradually lower to reach around 5\u00bc per cent by the end of the forecast period in mid 2023. While the outlook for unemployment is materially better than expected a few months ago, this still represents a significant amount of spare capacity in the economy, with the unemployment and underemployment rates expected to remain elevated across the forecast period. Although average hours worked have rebounded quickly to date, there are still some workers (particularly full-time) who remain on reduced or zero hours.", "Labour force participation has returned to historically high levels, as a large number of people who had temporarily left the workforce had already returned by December. Some further modest increase in participation is expected in the next few quarters, as the recent strength in employment encourages some people currently outside the workforce to enter or return. Further out, the participation rate is expected to ease back a little as the recovery matures, but longer-run structural drivers of increased participation (such as incremental increases in the pension eligibility age and better health outcomes for older people) are expected to remain in place.", "Public demand is expected to make a larger contribution to domestic final demand growth over the year to June 2021 than was anticipated at the time of the November Statement. The upgrade reflects capital spending plans in state budgets that were released over recent months, which foreshadowed a larger and more rapid increase in public investment than previously indicated. Aggregate public investment is forecast to increase by around 25 per cent over the year to June 2021, a boost that is roughly comparable to the increase in public investment after the global financial crisis. Public consumption is expected to grow modestly over coming quarters and then decline a little as direct spending related to management of the pandemic is reduced.", "Consumption is expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels around the end of 2021 (Graph 5.4). The ongoing recovery in consumption is expected to be underpinned by the recovery in labour income, net household wealth and a gradual decline in uncertainty related to health and economic outcomes. Over recent months, the recovery in household spending was a little faster than expected at the time of the previous Statement, led by households in Victoria. The improvement in labour market conditions has supported household income and partly offset an expected decline in non-labour income as tighter eligibility requirements for income support measures have come into effect. Households who were affected by the tightening of containment measures over the summer are expected to have reduced their spending only modestly and for a short period.", "The household saving rate is expected to decline from around 20 per cent in the September quarter 2020 to 5 per cent by the end of the forecast period, broadly in line with pre-pandemic levels. Household disposable income is expected to decline through the first half of 2021 as social assistance payments decline and the JobKeeper program is phased out, before income resumes a steady uptrend in line with the expected economic recovery. Consumption possibilities are expected to continue to broaden as restrictions ease further, which should be conducive to households spending a larger share of income received.", "Dwelling investment is forecast to return to its pre-pandemic level by mid 2021. Building approvals for detached houses and alterations & additions increased sharply in the second half of 2020, indicating that a strong pick-up in lower-density residential construction is underway. A large share of the dwelling investment expected to occur over the coming year is assumed to be activity pulled forward by the HomeBuilder scheme (and to a lesser extent, some state-based support measures). Investment in higher-density residential construction is expected to remain weak, consistent with low levels of building approvals.", "Non-mining business investment is forecast to increase gradually off a very low base over the first half of 2021 and return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. Investment in machinery & equipment is expected to lead the moderate recovery over the forecast period, after declining by less than previously anticipated over 2020. The rebound in domestic activity, expanded tax incentives for investment announced in the Australian Government Budget in October and increased business profits over recent quarters should all help to support investment, particularly in goods-related industries where business conditions are well above average.", "By contrast, non-residential construction is still expected to fall sharply in the near term as the pipeline of existing projects is worked through and recent weakness in building approvals suggests that few new projects will commence. Non-residential construction activity is not expected to pick up until late 2021, in part because of the long lags in the approval and planning of projects. More broadly, these projections occur against a backdrop where non-mining business investment in a number of advanced economies, including Australia, was subdued for a long period prior to the pandemic, in part reflecting uncertainty about future demand conditions. Firms are likely to be faced with high uncertainty for some time.", "Mining investment is now expected to be little changed in the near term compared with expectations of modest growth at the time of the November Statement. Recent survey data suggest some firms have scaled back their investment intentions, despite increases in some commodities prices towards the end of 2020. Further out, maintenance and sustaining projects are expected to support mining investment at around its current level. As yet, there have been no indications by major miners of plans to expand investment in response to recent high iron ore prices. Iron ore projects take a number of years to deliver and market participants expect prices to ease as Brazilian supply recovers.[1] While higher iron ore prices may not have much direct effect on near-term mining investment, higher prices will support state and federal government revenues through increased mining royalties and company income tax receipts.", "The outlook for exports is broadly similar to that in the November Statement, with exports gradually recovering and reaching pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. The forecast has been downgraded a little in the near term as recent weakness in coal exports is expected to persist, outweighing higher iron ore exports. Lower overseas student enrolments will also reduce education exports. That said, exports are expected to grow a little faster over 2022 as the availability of vaccines supports a quicker recovery in tourism and education once international travel restrictions ease. As in the November Statement, this easing is assumed to happen around the end of 2021.", "Forecast import growth has been revised up due to stronger domestic demand and the appreciation of the exchange rate, even though the appreciation of the Australian dollar is assumed to affect trade by less than usual, because of the restrictions on international travel. Imports are expected to exceed their pre-pandemic level at the start of 2022.", "The trade surplus is expected to be significantly wider than was anticipated in the November Statement as a near 15 per cent increase in the terms of trade across the forecast period more than outweighs higher import volumes. The terms of trade is boosted by higher profiles for iron ore, coal and LNG prices and a lower profile for import prices. As in the November Statement, iron ore prices are expected to decline over the forecast period, albeit from a significantly higher starting point that is near decade highs. As a result, the terms of trade are expected to decline over the second half of the forecast period but from a much higher level than previously anticipated (Graph 5.5).", "The outlook for wages growth is a little stronger than the baseline scenario in the November Statement, as absorption of spare capacity occurs at a slightly faster rate given the upgraded labour market outlook. However, even by mid 2023, the unemployment rate is still likely to be higher than is consistent with a tight labour market and a strong pick-up in wages growth. Year-ended growth in the Wage Price Index (WPI) is expected to remain below 2 per cent over the next few years, even slower than the low rates recorded prior to the pandemic (Graph 5.6).", "Despite the economic recovery getting underway in the September quarter, wages growth was weaker than in the June quarter, with the WPI increasing at its slowest rate since the series began 2 decades ago. Based on liaison reports, wages growth in the December quarter is expected to be weak again as private sector wage freezes remain widespread. As these wage freezes unwind, this will provide modest support to private sector wages growth over the year ahead, as will the strengthening labour market. Public sector wages will also pick up as some wage freezes and caps start to unwind. However, the broader outlook for public sector wages (which account for around one-quarter of the WPI) has been revised down slightly, as some state governments have announced measures to cap wage growth at lower rates than in recent years.", "In line with the more positive outlook for the labour market, the outlook for underlying inflation has been revised up a little relative to the November Statement. Nonetheless, inflation is still expected to be subdued throughout the forecast period, consistent with some spare capacity remaining in the economy and wages growth remaining below 2 per cent in the baseline scenario (Graph 5.7).", "Movements in headline inflation will continue to be choppy this year, reflecting the unwinding of rent reductions and various government support measures such as free child care and utilities rebates. Headline inflation is expected to increase to around 3 per cent over the year to June 2021, before dropping back to around 1\u00bd per cent by the end of the year. Underlying inflation is expected to increase only gradually over the forecast period, reaching around 1\u00be per cent by mid 2023.", "At a compositional level, there are a number of cross-currents expected to affect inflation outcomes in the near term. Strong demand for detached housing construction is expected to boost new dwelling inflation. While rents are very weak at present, they are likely to pick up a little over the year ahead as negotiated rent reductions unwind. Prices for consumer durables could increase further on the back of recent strong demand for cars and household items. Global supply chain disruptions had previously depleted inventories and generated some price pressures, but liaison reports suggest that this has now largely dissipated. Prices in other expenditure categories are expected to remain subdued; some government subsidies and rebates will remain in place for some time yet and a number of administered prices have been frozen. Utilities prices are also expected to continue to fall for some time, driven by low wholesale gas prices and increased electricity supply from renewables.", "The momentum in activity and labour markets, the additional boost to the economy from state and Australian government budgets and the successful health response to the latest set of localised outbreaks have combined to reduce near-term downside risks. Internationally, a number of vaccines have been approved and vaccinations have begun, which reduces some of the downside risk to the global recovery.", "Nevertheless, a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty continues to surround the economic outlook. In recognition of this, plausible upside and downside scenarios for the domestic economy (based on different health assumptions) are outlined below, followed by a discussion of other risks and uncertainties.", "A stronger domestic recovery than the one set out in the baseline scenario is possible if a sustained run of positive health outcomes enables the remaining restrictions on activity to be eased more quickly. This would be expected to lead to a stronger rebound in consumer and business confidence, as well increased opportunities for services consumption, including interstate travel. A less uncertain environment would boost consumption in this scenario by households drawing down on savings accumulated over the past year; the scenario assumes that over the next year and a half, households consume around 40 per cent of the unplanned savings accumulated over the June and September quarters of 2020. In this scenario, higher confidence and increased activity also contributes to a faster rebound in business investment than in the baseline forecast.", "The scenario also assumes faster-than-expected progress on overseas vaccination programs and more rapid control of virus outbreaks internationally. This underpins a faster recovery of tourism exports when international borders reopen, although the effect on GDP is almost entirely offset by stronger tourism imports in the scenario. Stronger activity and reduced uncertainty about the outlook support stronger labour demand and employment growth, which leads to a faster decline in the unemployment rate than in the baseline scenario; the unemployment rate declines to around 4\u00be by the end of 2022 in this scenario. Better labour market outcomes lead to a stronger pick-up in wages growth and a slightly faster increase in inflation over the next couple of years.", "A plausible downside scenario would involve further large outbreaks that require broad activity restrictions to be reimposed. While these would be less severe than the extended lockdowns assumed in previous downside scenarios, an upswing in domestic case numbers would see activity restrictions tightened. This would negatively affect confidence and weigh on private consumption and investment. In this scenario, the combination of activity restrictions and weaker confidence induces households to consume less and add further to their stock of accumulated savings.", "This scenario involves a longer and more damaging slowdown in activity than envisaged in the baseline scenario. Intermittent state border closures would be expected to prompt consumers to delay or reconsider interstate travel plans. Combined with temporary restrictions on activity and negative confidence effects this would reduce consumer spending and business investment. In this scenario, GDP increases more gradually over 2021, with growth only starting to pick up from early 2022. The slowing in activity and heightened uncertainty in this scenario would reduce momentum in the labour market recovery as firms put off hiring decisions and/or lay off extra workers. The unemployment rate peaks at a higher rate of 6\u00be per cent in mid 2021 in this scenario, and declines only slowly thereafter. The larger degree of spare labour market capacity places further downward pressure on wages growth, which sees inflation trend lower until mid 2022.", "Beyond the uncertainty around health outcomes discussed in the scenarios above, there are other sources of risk and uncertainty clouding the domestic outlook, some of which have become more balanced in recent times.", "One overarching issue will be how households and businesses respond to the tapering of fiscal and other temporary support measures following a period where household and business cash flows have been boosted by an extraordinary amount of policy support.", "In the corporate sector, insolvencies could rise by more than expected as temporary support measures are withdrawn, reducing investment, slowing activity and placing upward pressure on the unemployment rate. There is also a risk that recent tax incentives that have supported business investment mostly pull forward demand, leading to a period of weak investment after the incentives expire. On the other hand, for some businesses that were able to build cash buffers and adapt their business models last year, stronger balance sheets and the opening of new opportunities as a result of the pandemic could provide a basis for a faster recovery. If elevated commodity prices persist longer than expected, it is also possible that this prompts mining firms to lift investment towards the end of the forecast period.", "For the household sector, there are also risks to the baseline scenario forecasts in both directions. The expected decline in income through to mid year and a slowing in the recovery in labour markets could drag on the recovery in household consumption, as could a longer-lasting shift in risk preferences that results in the saving rate stabilising at a higher level. In the other direction, a stronger recovery in labour income, larger asset price gains and reduced economic uncertainty could prompt households to consume at a faster pace than currently envisaged in the baseline scenario, including by quickly drawing down on the large saving buffers accumulated over 2020. Higher housing prices could also support detached dwelling investment (alongside consumption) by more than expected, even as fiscal support measures unwind.", "Turning to public investment, governments have collectively announced a large increase in capital spending over the year to June 2021. It is assumed that this spending occurs in a way that is broadly consistent with historical patterns of investment realisation and that capacity constraints are minimal. A more rapid rollout of public investment presents an upside risk to the forecasts given the intent of governments to ensure the timely rollout of capital spending programs. At the same time, there is a risk that the high level of budgeted capital spending could be slower to materialise due to capacity constraints, although subdued conditions in private non-residential construction means this is less likely than in the recent past.", "The unusual nature of this downturn and recovery makes it difficult to judge the extent of spare capacity in the economy; any scarring effects would tend to damage the supply side of the economy and lower the growth rate of potential output. Although the improved outlook for the labour market suggests spare capacity will be absorbed faster than had been previously forecast, underutilisation is still expected to remain high for several years, which might delay the gradual pick-up in wages growth and inflation over the forecast period. It is also possible that if the unemployment rate were to decline more rapidly than expected, it might not be accompanied by stronger wage or price pressures if spare capacity is underestimated and wage and price inflation expectations become anchored at low levels. Given the extent of private and public sector wage freezes, as well as the likelihood that wages growth and underlying inflation remain below 2 per cent for an extended period, low inflation expectations may persist.", "On the other hand, higher prices for some consumption goods and services, in part as a result of supply side bottlenecks, could lead to a sharper-than-expected increase in retail price inflation. Some firms will be better placed than others in passing through price pressures to consumers. More broadly, the speed of the labour market recovery so far, and possible changes in labour demand (such as for particular skills or in specific locations) combined with some labour supply constraints (such as border restrictions affecting the availability of skilled labour sourced overseas), could mean pockets of faster wages growth emerge more quickly, spilling over into broader measures of wage and price expectations.", "A stronger economic recovery than the one outlined in the baseline scenario is possible if ongoing low case numbers in Australia and a sustained run of positive health outcomes enable a faster easing of domestic restrictions. These outcomes would boost consumer and business confidence and reduce uncertainty, leading to a stronger recovery in private consumption and investment. In this scenario, a stronger rebound in activity would see the unemployment rate decline at a faster pace, falling to around 4\u00be per cent by the end of 2022.", "Alternatively, a plausible downside scenario is that Australia experiences further large outbreaks of the virus. It is assumed that this would require broad activity restrictions to be reimposed, though not the extended lockdowns assumed in previous downside scenarios. In this scenario, consumer and business confidence would be weaker and the recovery in household consumption and business investment would be slower than in the baseline scenario. As a result the unemployment rate would peak in this scenario at around 6\u00be per cent in mid 2021 and decline only slowly in 2022."], "4. Inflation": ["Consumer price movements in 2020 were dominated by the impact of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as large swings in average fuel prices earlier in the year. This introduced more volatility than usual in headline inflation readings. Looking through this volatility, underlying inflation pressures are low.", "Over the second half of the year, the unwinding of government support measures such as free child care boosted inflation significantly. Housing inflation also picked up a little in the December quarter on the back of increased demand for detached houses, supported by government grants, while some temporary rent reductions reversed. Offsetting this has been a moderation in retail price inflation; although price movements are still being shaped by increased expenditure on household goods relative to services, the effect of this is easing, as is the effect of earlier global supply chain pressures. There were also some methodological challenges that affected CPI outcomes throughout the year \u2013 most notably the need to impute prices for items that were unavailable due to activity restrictions \u2013 but these factors were largely resolved by the end of the year.", "Wages growth has slowed further recently, as employers have responded to the economic challenges of the pandemic by delaying wage increases, imposing freezes and, in some cases, applying temporary wage cuts. Recent lower award wage decisions have also weighed on wage outcomes. While many of these measures are temporary, and will provide some near-term boost to wages as they unwind, forward indicators suggest wages growth will remain soft this year. National accounts measures of wages growth have been temporarily boosted by the JobKeeper wage subsidy, as well as by large compositional effects due to greater employment losses in lower-paid jobs.", "Headline inflation was 0.8 per cent (seasonally adjusted) in the December quarter (Table 4.1; Graph 4.1). Much of this increase was driven by the further unwinding of government support measures such as free child care, as well as the annual increase in the tobacco excise rate. In year-ended terms, headline inflation was 0.9 per cent. This was slightly higher than expected at the time of the November Statement on Monetary Policy, mainly because prices of some components that have been affected by pandemic-related policies rose more than expected.", "The main drivers of the increase in the headline CPI in the December quarter were the return to full-price child care for the entire quarter and price rises for tobacco and medical & hospital services (Graph 4.2). Together, these price increases contributed 0.8 percentage points to CPI inflation in the quarter. Housing-related prices also increased in aggregate; new dwelling prices rose, driven by strong demand as purchasers sought to utilise the various government incentives on offer, while rents were broadly steady. These increases were offset by price falls for utilities due to government rebates. Prices for retail items also declined modestly as global supply disruptions eased and discounting resumed for food and some consumer durables.", "Measures of underlying inflation over 2020 were affected by some unusually large component-level price movements and the imputation approach adopted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for missing prices. However, these issues had largely abated by the December quarter, providing a clearer signal of the low underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. Trimmed mean inflation was subdued at 0.4 per cent in the December quarter and 1.2 per cent over the year (Graph 4.3). Spare capacity in the economy and associated low wages growth have contributed to muted underlying inflationary pressures for a number of years.", "The ABS updates expenditure weights every year in December to ensure that the weights are reflective of spending by Australian households. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the changes in the weights were unusually large for some components (see \u2018Box A: Consumption Patterns and Consumer Price Index Weights\u2019). The new weights were applied to the December quarter 2020 CPI, but they did not affect reported inflation outcomes much.", "Administered prices, which comprise around 15 per cent of the consumption basket, rebounded further in the December quarter following a sharp decline earlier in the pandemic. Australian Government subsidies for child care services substantially reduced the price of child care in the June quarter and early September quarter (Graph 4.4). The return to full-price child care in early July, alongside broad-based price increases by providers in October, boosted quarter-average CPI child care prices in both the September and December quarters. This resulted in child care prices ending the year a touch above their pre-pandemic levels. The end of the free child care program (which had also covered before- and after-school care services) also boosted preschool & primary education prices. Together, these increases contributed 0.4 percentage points to headline inflation in the December quarter. However, prices for preschool & primary education are likely to remain below their pre-COVID-19 levels for some time as free preschool programs in New South Wales and Victoria have been extended until end 2021.", "Other administered prices (excluding utilities) rose a little in the December quarter (Graph 4.5). Medical & hospital services inflation was unusually strong, reflected in the average increase in private health insurance premiums of 2.9 per cent (Graph 4.6). This contributed 0.2 percentage points to headline inflation in the quarter. Premiums typically increase in April each year, but insurers agreed to defer the 2020 increase until October in order to ease pressure on customers during the initial phase of the pandemic. Urban transport fares also increased as discounted off-peak transport prices ended in Sydney. Administered price inflation has trended lower over many years, and this trend is expected to persist for some time partly because of ongoing administered price freezes in a number of states and territories.", "Prices for utilities, which account for around 5 per cent of the consumption basket, declined further by 4.4 per cent in the December quarter, in large part because of special rebates introduced in some states (Graph 4.7). The Western Australian Government provided households with a one-off credit of $600 to reduce their electricity bills from 1 November, which led to a large temporary decline in WA electricity prices in the quarter. The rebate was applied to quarterly electricity bills from November onward and will continue to weigh on prices in early 2021 as additional customers receive the rebate; this will be partly offset by price increases as customers that have already received the rebates return to normal billing over the coming months. The Queensland Government also provided additional rebates that were applied to households' electricity bills in the September and December quarters. Gas prices were generally unchanged across most capital cities in the quarter.", "Utilities inflation has been subdued for the past 2 years and is likely to remain low for some time. Domestic wholesale gas prices have fallen in recent months. Lower wholesale gas prices and increased electricity supply from renewables continue to put downward pressure on utilities prices. Retail utilities prices in Canberra, Darwin, Hobart and Perth are expected to remain broadly unchanged until the second half of 2021 due to state and territory government price freezes.", "The 2 largest components of the CPI basket are new dwelling purchases by owner-occupiers and rents; together these account for around one-sixth of the CPI basket. Housing-related inflation rose a little in the December quarter, after slowing sharply in the first half of 2020.", "Prices for newly constructed dwellings increased by 0.7 per cent in the quarter and were 1.7 per cent higher over the year, reflecting stronger demand in the detached housing sector (Graph 4.8). This demand has been boosted by the Australian Government's HomeBuilder program and some state government grants. In particular, demand for new detached dwellings surged in the December quarter as purchasers finalised contracts before the scheduled reduction in the value of the HomeBuilder grant on 1 January 2021. Although these grants are reflected as measured price declines in the CPI, increased demand for new housing encouraged some builders to increase base prices or offer fewer discounts to buyers, more than offsetting this effect. Price inflation for new dwellings has been particularly strong in Perth over the past few quarters following a prolonged period of weakness. Despite the recent pick up in new dwelling prices in Sydney and Melbourne, new dwelling inflation there remains low relative to history.", "Rents were broadly steady in the December quarter but were 1.3 per cent lower over the year (Graph 4.9). Declines in rental prices over the middle of 2020 in part reflected elevated supply of rental properties and weaker demand because of travel restrictions and lower population growth. Rent reductions for existing tenants continued to weigh on rent inflation in the December quarter, but this decline was offset by renters who had previously negotiated temporary discounts returning to their usual payments. Rents increased notably in Perth in the quarter, partly reflecting tighter rental market conditions following several years of subdued growth in dwelling investment. In contrast, rents were fairly flat in Sydney and Melbourne.", "Fuel prices were fairly steady over the September and December quarters, after falling sharply and only partially recovering over the first half of 2020 (Graph 4.10). There was a notable rise in fuel prices in the month of January \u2013 at current levels, automotive fuel is expected to contribute around \u00bc percentage point to headline CPI in the March quarter.", "Higher tobacco prices contributed 0.2 percentage points to headline CPI in the December quarter (Graph 4.11). In addition to regular indexation, since 2013 tobacco prices have incorporated excise increases of 12\u00bd per cent in September each year. The boost to headline inflation from these increases is expected to subside in 2021 as the tobacco excise returns to regular indexation.", "Retail prices, which comprise just over a quarter of the CPI, declined a little in the December quarter, but remained higher than they were a year ago. During 2020, sustained demand for many consumer durable items had driven retail prices higher as a large share of people spent more time at home during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. Reduced stock availability owing to global supply chain pressures also put upward pressure on prices for some retail items. As these pressures started easing, price increases slowed in the December quarter, particularly for furniture & household appliances (Graph 4.12). Part of this reflected the resumption of discounting by some retailers, as well as increased retailer participation in Black Friday sales events. Prices for clothing & footwear fell alongside subdued demand and increased discounting during sales periods in November and December. In contrast, motor vehicle price inflation remains elevated due to continued price pressures from strong demand and reduced domestic inventory.", "Grocery prices (excluding fruit & vegetables) increased a little in the December quarter (Graph 4.13). Liaison reports suggest that supermarket discounting behaviour has returned to pre-pandemic patterns, following a reduction in discounting as demand increased strongly during the early stages of the pandemic. Price increases were notable for beef & veal, as better seasonal conditions have led some farmers to rebuild herds, reducing the supply of meat.", "Prices for fruit & vegetables, which can be volatile, declined in the December quarter. Despite recent reports of labour shortages for some produce harvesting, potential supply disruptions do not appear to have led to widespread price pressures.", "Inflation remains low for market services, which includes hairdressing, financial services, meals out & takeaway and domestic travel, and comprises a little under one-quarter of the consumption basket (Graph 4.14). The ABS has been able to return to normal price collection for domestic travel, which recorded a 3.8 per cent price increase in the December quarter. The only item that was still imputed (using headline CPI) in the quarter was international holiday travel & accommodation. Price inflation for household services slowed in the quarter, as demand moderated a little from the high levels seen immediately after restrictions were eased in many parts of the country in the previous quarter. In contrast, prices increased for meals out & takeaway.", "Price- and wage-setting behaviour can be affected by expectations about the future rate of inflation. Market economists' year-ahead inflation expectations have remained broadly steady following some volatility over the second half of 2020. In part this is because recent large anticipated changes in some price components (such as the effects of oil prices and child care subsidies) are no longer influencing year-ahead expectations (Graph 4.15). Unions' inflation expectations remain relatively subdued. Consensus and market economists' long-term inflation expectations are around 2\u20132\u00bd per cent and remain consistent with the Bank's medium-term inflation target.", "Growth in the Wage Price Index (WPI) slowed to 0.1 per cent in the September quarter, to be 1.4 per cent in year-ended terms. This is the lowest reading since this series began 2 decades ago. Private sector wages growth remained at 0.1 per cent in the quarter, as many employers responded to the pandemic by delaying financial year-end wage reviews and enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA) increases (Graph 4.16). Public sector wages growth declined to 0.2 per cent, reflecting deferred wage increases for Commonwealth employees, delays in negotiating the Victorian public service EBA and delays and reductions in wage increases for New South Wales state government employees.", "Wages growth has been weakest in industries most reliant on award wage increases, including accommodation & food services and retail trade. Annual increases in award wages usually occur in the September quarter, but the Fair Work Commission decided in June to delay effective increases for most awards to November or February. These delayed awards are expected to provide some support to wages growth in affected industries in coming quarters, although the increase in award wages will be smaller than it has been in recent years in light of the current economic environment.", "The national accounts measure of average earnings per hour declined a little in the September quarter, as hours worked in lower-paid jobs rebounded, bringing the composition of hours worked closer to its pre-pandemic mix (Graph 4.17). The JobKeeper wage subsidy continued to affect this measure of earnings; employees' average hourly earnings are boosted above their ordinary earnings in cases where employees would otherwise have earned less per fortnight than the minimum JobKeeper payment (which was $1,500 throughout most of the September quarter).", "The further recovery in activity and changes to JobKeeper eligibility requirements in the December quarter are expected to have reduced the number of employers using the program, although payments to firms in industries most impacted by pandemic-related restrictions are likely to have remained elevated. With JobKeeper due to expire at the end of March, some further declines in measured average earnings are expected in coming quarters.", "Liaison reports suggest that wages growth will remain weak for some time. The proportion of firms reporting they had wage freezes in place or intended to implement wage freezes this year increased further in the December quarter (Graph 4.18). Some firms also reported that bonuses would be reduced or withheld in coming quarters. However, in most cases these measures are expected to be temporary, with some unwinding of freezes and delays expected over the course of 2021.", "Government wage policies announced in recent months have softened the outlook for public sector wages. The Australian Government has announced a wages policy that ties wage adjustments in future EBAs for Commonwealth public servants to private sector WPI outcomes. Some state governments have also announced measures to delay wage increases or cap wages growth at lower rates than had applied in recent years."], "2. Domestic Economic Conditions": ["The recovery in the Australian economy is well underway. The lifting of restrictions in Victoria has contributed to a further improvement across a range of indicators of economic activity. Employment has recovered faster than previously expected and has supported growth in household spending. Extraordinary policy measures have continued to support household and business cash flow and balance sheet positions.", "Nevertheless, conditions in parts of the private economy remain weak. Firms' reported investment intentions across most industries are sharply lower than before the pandemic. While some businesses have been able to adapt their activities, those in a number of industries such as the arts, hospitality and tourism continue to be significantly affected by the disruptions induced by the pandemic. The recovery in New South Wales and Victoria has been more restrained than elsewhere, due to mobility restrictions and the larger effect on these states of international border closures. Full-time employment is still well below pre-pandemic levels and the unemployment rate remains much higher than a year ago. As set out in the \u2018Economic Outlook\u2019 chapter, the recovery will depend on health outcomes and the ability of households and businesses to adjust through a period where some temporary support measures are unwound.", "The Australian economy rebounded by 3 per cent in the September quarter, following a 7 per cent contraction in the June quarter (Graph 2.1). The main contributor to growth in the September quarter was household consumption, which increased by 8 per cent, supported by growth in household income, the lifting of restrictions and a reduction in precautionary behaviour. Public investment and dwelling investment increased but business investment declined in the quarter. Indicators of economic activity have, for the most part, picked up since September, and GDP growth is expected to have been solid in the December quarter, underpinned by the continued recovery in household consumption.", "Employment increased by 280,000 people in the December quarter to be a little below its February 2020 level. Much of the increase in recent months has been in Victoria, where employment rebounded as restrictions in that state eased, while employment in other states has continued to recover at a more moderate pace (Graph 2.2). Nationally, total hours worked remain a little below their pre-pandemic level, both because the number of people in employment is yet to fully recover and some workers are yet to see their weekly hours return to previous levels (Graph 2.3). The large increase in the number of employed people working zero hours for economic reasons in the initial phase of the pandemic has mostly unwound as activity has picked up. Improved economic conditions have also supported a recovery in average hours worked, to be near pre-pandemic levels.", "The number of people employed part time has returned to its pre-pandemic level, but full-time employment has only partially recovered; there were around 125,000 fewer full-time workers in December 2020 compared with February (Graph 2.4). The recovery in part-time work has been fairly widespread across industries, with the level of part-time employment in most industries back to, or above, pre-pandemic levels; the accommodation & food services industry is a notable exception (Graph 2.5). The fall and subsequent recovery in part-time employment was unusually large compared to the experience of previous labour market slowdowns, reflecting the larger share of part-time workers in industries most affected by activity restrictions. Employment is yet to fully recover in industries that were most affected by restrictions on activity, whether directly (such as many household services industries) or indirectly as suppliers. For example, although manufacturing was less directly constrained by activity restrictions, employment in this industry in November was well below its level in February; around two-thirds of these employment losses were in food product manufacturing, where around 40 per cent of industry output is supplied to domestic hospitality services or is exported.", "The unemployment rate was 6.6 per cent in December, down from its peak of 7.5 per cent in July 2020 (Graph 2.6). The decline in the unemployment rate has been faster than expected at the time of the previous Statement on Monetary Policy, reflecting a stronger-than-anticipated recovery in activity and employment in the December quarter. Growth in employment was greater than the increase in labour market participation, which has been boosted by the return of individuals who had temporarily exited the labour force in the first phase of the pandemic. The participation rate in December reached a historic high of 66.2 per cent; it was near or above pre-pandemic levels in all states.", "Despite improving labour market conditions, there were still over 900,000 people unemployed in December, around 220,000 more than in February 2020. Broader indicators of spare capacity in the labour market have reversed much of the increases recorded in mid 2020, but remain elevated. The heads-based underemployment rate \u2013 which measures the share of full-time workers working reduced hours for economic reasons and part-time workers willing and available to work more hours \u2013 was 8.5 per cent in December, around its pre-pandemic level. The rate of labour market underutilisation \u2013 which adds together unemployed and underemployed people \u2013 was around 15 per cent in December, still well above pre-pandemic levels.", "Forward-looking indicators of employment such as job advertisements and vacancies have continued to improve in recent months. Job advertisements remain below peaks seen in recent years, while vacancies are now above pre-pandemic levels (Graph 2.7). Survey indicators of employment intentions have picked up strongly since mid 2020. Information from business liaison also suggests improved employment expectations, although the outlook is mixed across industries. Some firms in restriction-affected industries, such as tourism and education, still expect to reduce employment over the year ahead. In the construction sector, near-term employment intentions in apartment and non-residential construction are also subdued, but employment in detached home construction has been strong, especially in Western Australia. The outlook for employment in infrastructure-related businesses is picking up as projects get underway.", "Liaison information suggests that firms that are no longer eligible for JobKeeper payments are generally finding demand has recovered sufficiently to maintain or increase staffing levels. Firms that expect to remain eligible for JobKeeper have typically experienced a fall in revenue due to the restrictions in Victoria in the second half of 2020, or are in industries that are more affected by domestic and international travel restrictions.", "Several states experienced community outbreaks of COVID-19 over recent months stemming from returned overseas travellers. A rapid and targeted response by state authorities brought these outbreaks under control without affecting activity materially. A mix of short localised lockdowns, mandated use of masks, reductions in gathering sizes, intensive contract tracing by health authorities and restrictions on movement across state and territory borders were implemented. While indicators of mobility declined, particularly in Sydney, part of this was probably seasonal and movement of people remained higher nationally relative to the earlier outbreaks in 2020. Surveyed measures of consumer and business confidence also held broadly steady and remain around long-run averages (Graph 2.8).", "Household consumption recovered strongly over the second half of 2020, but remained below its pre-pandemic level. Timely indicators suggest household spending increased in the December quarter, supported by favourable health outcomes, an improvement in labour market conditions, a return of consumer sentiment to around pre-pandemic levels and policy measures that have boosted household cash flow. The categories of spending that were most constrained by activity restrictions earlier in the year rebounded quickly as social distancing restrictions were eased, such as cafes & restaurants and clothing & footwear (Graph 2.9). Sales of household goods remain elevated, having benefited from the substitution from services where consumption possibilities are still constrained.", "Information from liaison suggests that the recent domestic COVID-19 outbreaks had only a modest effect on overall household spending. Consumption patterns are likely to have shifted a bit in those states that recently imposed tighter mobility restrictions. For example, spending on discretionary services and travel declined a little, while sales of household goods and food increased, consistent with households spending more time at home.", "Nominal household disposable income increased by 3\u00bd per cent in the September quarter, to be 8 per cent higher in year-ended terms; this is the strongest growth in nearly a decade (Graph 2.10). The JobKeeper program continued to support household cash flow, as did the recovery in economic activity and the labour market. Social assistance payments remained elevated. Towards the end of the year, tighter eligibility requirements for several policies took effect and the early superannuation withdrawal scheme concluded. Partly offsetting this, tax cuts brought forward in the Australian Government Budget took effect from October and pensioners and some other households have begun to receive two further Economic Support Payments, each valued at $250.", "The household saving rate rose sharply early on in the pandemic because income increased and consumption declined. The household sector is estimated to have accumulated buffers of around $200 billion over the June and September quarters, or around 15 per cent of pre-pandemic annual income. The saving rate edged a bit lower but remained very high at close to 20 per cent in the September quarter (Graph 2.11). The pattern of consumption over recent quarters suggests restrictions on activity and strong health incentives to avoid some types of consumption have been primary drivers of the increase in household saving. Income uncertainty has also contributed to some extent, especially for those households whose income was most affected by the pandemic.", "Housing prices nationally increased by 3 per cent over the past year (Table 2.1). This was despite Sydney and Melbourne recording price declines following the onset of the pandemic. In recent months, housing prices have increased in all capital cities, although prices remain below their previous peaks in several cities (Graph 2.12). Housing price increases in regional Australia outpaced growth in the capital cities over the second half of 2020. Prices for houses have also increased by more than prices for units in recent months. Non-price indicators, including housing turnover, increased further towards the end of the year. Auction clearance rates increased in December in Sydney and Melbourne and auction volumes also increased. Lending data indicated that owner-occupiers accounted for a large proportion of recent housing purchases, supported by very low interest rates and policies to support first home buyers (see \u2018Domestic Financial Conditions\u2019 chapter).", "Rental market conditions for owners of apartments in Sydney and Melbourne are weak, but conditions for houses have generally strengthened across most cities and regional areas. Advertised rents for units in Sydney and Melbourne have continued to decline over the past 6 months, while rents for houses in both cities increased a little (Graph 2.13). In December the rental vacancy rate declined noticeably in Sydney and edged down in Melbourne, though they remained elevated in both cities (Graph 2.14). By contrast, vacancy rates in Perth declined to near-record lows and rents increased strongly, partly reflecting the limited supply of new rental stock. Some rental markets outside the capital cities remained tight. Advertised rents grew more strongly in regional New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria than in the capital cities of these states, in part driven by strong demand from households relocating from the capital cities.", "Building approvals for detached dwellings increased strongly over the second half of 2020 to be around their highest level on record (Graph 2.15). Approvals for alterations & additions also increased sharply in New South Wales and Queensland. Strong demand from owner-occupiers, particularly first home buyers, has been encouraged by policy support, including low interest rates and the Australian Government's HomeBuilder scheme. Sales of new homes increased sharply in December as buyers sought to secure the full $25,000 HomeBuilder Grant by signing contracts before the end of the month. Greenfield land sales remained elevated in the December quarter, driven by a surge in sales in Melbourne, while sales in other capital cities eased a little. Almost all detached home builders in the Bank's liaison program report that their construction pipelines are \u2018full\u2019 well into 2021, with activity expected to peak in the middle of 2021; extensions to deadlines for construction commencement for government grants has helped to extend the order book for builders.", "Approvals for higher-density dwellings have remained very low nationally. Developers in the liaison program report that sales of off-the-plan apartments remain weak, citing buyer preferences for established or recently completed properties, rental income uncertainty weighing on investor demand and an absence of foreign buyers. Some developers reported that they had delayed commencements of planned projects, and they expect demand for higher-density apartments to remain low for the foreseeable future. This is consistent with the sharp reduction in net overseas migration, contributing to the slowest rate of population growth in a century, and a shift in buyer preferences towards detached housing.", "Health and other pandemic management spending over recent quarters contributed to a 6 per cent increase in public demand over the year to the September quarter. Public investment was unchanged over the year, although most states released budgets since the previous Statement that foreshadow a large increase in investment spending over the next few years. Projects flagged by state government budgets included large and small infrastructure projects and the construction of social housing.", "The consolidated deficit of the Australian and state governments is expected to peak at just under 15 per cent of GDP in 2020/21 (Graph 2.16). Improved economic conditions over the second half of 2020 contributed to a revision to the expected Australian Government Budget deficit, from around 11 to 10 per cent of GDP, in the mid-year budget update. Projections from the Australian and state treasuries suggest that the consolidated deficit will decline sharply after 2020/21, reflecting the expiry of income support measures such as JobKeeper and improved economic conditions.", "Private non-mining business investment declined by a further 4 per cent in the September quarter, to be 13 per cent lower over the year (Graph 2.17). Heightened restrictions in Victoria constrained non-residential construction activity in the quarter, but by less than anticipated. Machinery & equipment investment fell further, to be its lowest level since 2006. The decline in machinery & equipment investment was significant but smaller than had been expected, leading to a more moderate fall in non-mining investment overall.", "Firms' expectations for investment increased off a very low base in the most recent ABS Capital Expenditure (Capex) survey (Graph 2.18). In particular, non-mining firms anticipate a more moderate decline in machinery & equipment investment this financial year than had previously been expected. The Capex survey, conducted in October and November, was the first since the announcement of expanded tax incentives for investment by the Australian Government. The increase in business profits over recent quarters will also help to support the outlook for investment as activity continues to recover. Expectations for non-residential construction by non-mining firms remain weak, consistent with the low level of building approvals in the second half of 2020.", "Mining investment declined by 5 per cent in the September quarter, but was moderately higher over the year. Information from liaison and company reports continue to suggest that investment will be supported by work on iron ore and coal projects this financial year. However, spending will likely be more modest than was previously anticipated, with the Capex survey indicating that some firms have scaled back their investment intentions (Graph 2.19).", "The trade surplus narrowed significantly in the September quarter (Graph 2.20). Import volumes increased strongly, driven by imports of capital and consumer goods, consistent with the ongoing recovery in domestic spending. At the same time export volumes declined by around 3 per cent in the quarter, led by lower resource exports. Trade in services remained constrained by ongoing restrictions on international travel.", "The trade surplus widened a little in the December quarter. Partial data suggest that trade in goods picked up over the period. Increased exports of machinery & equipment have supported growth in manufactured exports as global demand has improved. Rural exports have also increased, led by cereals after the drought broke in parts of Australia last year. The outlook for the rural sector remains favourable, with record crop production forecast by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARES) as a result of good growing conditions associated with the La Ni\u00f1a event underway (Graph 2.21).", "Resource export volumes also appear to have increased in the December quarter, although coal exports remained at low levels (Graph 2.22). Domestic coal production had been cut back in response to lower prices since the onset of the pandemic. Prices have since recovered because a cold Northern Hemisphere winter has increased demand for thermal coal, and Indian steel production has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. But coal exports to China have fallen in recent months and could remain weak for some time because of ongoing uncertainty surrounding Chinese coal import policies and the bilateral trading relationship; any increase in coal exports will likely involve diverting these exports elsewhere.", "Partial trade data suggest that iron ore export volumes were little changed in the December quarter, as exports from Western Australia were affected by maintenance and weather-related port disruptions. Iron ore exports are expected to remain close to capacity as producers respond to high iron ore prices, which have been underpinned by strong Chinese steel production and constrained global supply. LNG exports look to have risen owing to increased energy demand from the cold Northern Hemisphere winter.", "Goods imports have continued to increase in recent months in line with the recovery in domestic spending. Imports of consumption goods are well above their pre-pandemic level. Imports of passenger motor vehicles have driven the rebound, having increased in each of the last 6 months. Despite the strength in consumer goods imports, many retailers in the business liaison program report that inventories remain lower than ideal. Capital goods imports have also increased over recent months, especially imports of industrial transport equipment."], "3. Domestic Financial Conditions": ["The Reserve Bank's policy measures announced in 2020 \u2013 including the reduction in the cash rate, the target for the yield on the 3-year Australian Government bond, the $100 billion bond purchase program, and the Term Funding Facility (TFF) \u2013 have lowered funding costs across the private and public sectors and are supporting balance sheets and asset prices. Interest rates on housing and business loans are at historic lows and the Reserve Bank's measures have also supported the availability of credit to households and businesses. On average, lending rates have declined broadly in line with banks' funding costs, although the extent of reductions in interest rates has varied across different types of housing and business loans. Demand for housing finance picked up in the second half of 2020, but demand for new business loans remains subdued. In February the Reserve Bank announced that it would purchase an additional $100 billion of bonds when the current bond purchase program is completed in mid April.", "By lowering the structure of interest rates across the economy, the Reserve Bank's policy measures have contributed to a lower exchange rate than otherwise. Nevertheless, against the backdrop of a general improvement in expectations for a recovery in global growth, which has seen commodity prices rise markedly, the Australian dollar has appreciated since November. Australian equity prices have increased over recent months, but are slightly below the levels seen a year ago.", "The yield on the 3-year Australian Government Security (AGS) declined following the package of further policy measures announced in early November, and has remained consistent with the new target of around 10 basis points, supported by $9 billion of Bank purchases of the April 2023 and April 2024 bonds in the secondary market in November and early December (Graph 3.1).", "Since the commencement of the $100 billion bond purchase program in early November, the Bank has purchased $55 billion of longer-term bonds under this program. Of these, as planned, 80 per cent has been allocated to AGS and 20 per cent to bonds issued by the state and territory borrowing authorities (known as semi-government securities, or semis). The effect of the program can be estimated by examining the cumulative response of bond yields to key news about the program. This suggests that the program has contributed to a decline of roughly 30 basis points in 10-year AGS yields and a narrowing of around 5\u201310 basis points in semis spreads to AGS. Also, the spread between the 10-year AGS yield and the equivalent US Treasury yield has narrowed by around 30 basis points when compared with the months before the market was anticipating a bond purchase program by the Bank (Graph 3.2). However, other factors also influence AGS yields, including economic developments domestically and offshore. As a result, the level of the 10-year AGS yield has risen over recent months, alongside a similar rise in US Treasury yields and global yields more broadly. This rise in global long-end yields has been driven in part by progress in the development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, and prospects for further US fiscal stimulus following the US election results. The $100 billion extension to the bond purchase program, announced on 2 February, was to a large extent anticipated by market participants and so it led to a very modest reduction in longer-term yields and spreads when announced.", "AGS and semis markets have continued to function smoothly over recent months, with bid-offer spreads remaining around their average levels of recent years. These are well below the elevated levels seen during the period of market dislocation in March and April last year, which the Bank helped to alleviate with purchases of bonds and provision of liquidity through open market operations (OMO). Spreads between the yields on semis and AGS remain near historical lows (Graph 3.3). In November, the ASX launched a new 5-year AGS futures contract, which should support the liquidity of bonds of that maturity.", "Funding conditions remained favourable for the Australian and the state and territory governments. Government bond yields remain near historical lows and markets have absorbed large volumes of issuance. The Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) has issued $160 billion of Treasury Bonds and $69 billion of Treasury Notes since the start of July 2020 (Graph 3.4). This pace of issuance is well above that of recent years, although issuance slowed over the fourth quarter of 2020 with the AOFM well ahead of schedule based on its expected funding requirements. Accordingly, following the update of the 2020/21 federal budget in mid December, the AOFM announced weekly bond issuance will remain around $2\u20133 billion per week, which is well below the $4\u20135 billion per week seen earlier in the financial year. Demand at AOFM tenders has been consistently strong, including for the $6 billion syndicated tap in November 2020 of the existing 2041 bond line. While the projected increase in government debt for 2020/21 and the associated stock of debt outstanding are the largest as a share of GDP in a number of decades, they are not unprecedented (Graph 3.5). Moreover, the stock of debt as a share of GDP remains low compared with other advanced countries.", "The TFF is providing low-cost term funding to authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) and an incentive for ADIs to increase lending to businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).[1] In November 2020, the interest rate on new TFF drawings was reduced from 0.25 per cent to 0.1 per cent, in line with the reduction in other policy rates.", "The total funding allowance available under the TFF is around $185 billion as of February 2021, which is about 7 per cent of outstanding credit. This includes: drawings under the initial allowance; funding available under the additional allowance (linked to ADIs' new lending to businesses); and the supplementary allowance (added to the facility effective from October 2020).", "In aggregate, ADIs have drawn around $86 billion in TFF funding to date. TFF drawdowns slowed after the window to access the initial allowance closed on 30 September, and drawdowns of the remaining (supplementary and additional) allowances have remained modest (Graph 3.6). This reflects the fact that ADIs remain well funded and the deadline for accessing these allowances is not until 30 June 2021. Many ADIs have indicated in liaison that they plan to take up most or all of their supplementary allowances, although some ADIs have indicated that they have access to sufficient private funding for their needs and will not draw all of their remaining allowances. The TFF is continuing to help keep funding costs and lending rates at historic lows.", "Liquidity in the banking system \u2013 as measured by exchange settlement (ES) balances held at the Reserve Bank \u2013 has increased further in recent months (Graph 3.7). Since November, this has mainly reflected the effect of the Bank's purchases of government bonds (Graph 3.8). Government flows have also recently added to system liquidity because net government spending (which increases system liquidity) has exceeded net government issuance (which reduces system liquidity), following a period in which the reverse was true.[2]", "Since the onset of the pandemic, ES balances have risen by around $130 billion, reflecting the Reserve Bank's government bond purchases as well as lending under the TFF. These large liquidity injections have reduced the demand by banks for funding in the Bank's OMO; as a result, the amount of liquidity provided via OMO has declined to its lowest level since 2013. Since the start of the pandemic, government flows have tended to reduce system liquidity, as net issuance of Australian Government bonds has exceeded net spending by the Australian Government over this period.", "These developments are reflected in the Reserve Bank's balance sheet, which has almost doubled in size since the start of the pandemic and currently stands at around $335 billion. Growth in the Bank's assets has been driven by an increase in holdings of long-dated government bonds \u2013 as a result of the Bank's bond purchases \u2013 and an increase in securities held as collateral under the TFF (Graph 3.9). This has been partly offset by a decline in securities provided as collateral in OMO. On the liabilities side, ES balances have risen significantly (as discussed above). Deposits held by the Australian Government at the Reserve Bank have also grown substantially since the pandemic began, again because funds raised via government bond issuance have, to date, exceeded net spending by the Australian Government (Graph 3.10).", "Following the reduction of the cash rate target to 10 basis points at the Reserve Bank Board meeting in early November, the cash rate declined and is currently 3 basis points (Graph 3.11). Financial market prices imply that investors expect the cash rate to remain close to this level for a considerable period. The cash rate remains a little above the rate of remuneration on ES balances, which was reduced to zero in early November. This difference reflects the compensation required by the banks that lend excess balances in the overnight cash market to cover the associated transaction costs and credit risks. The cash rate has been trading below the cash rate target since March 2020. This was expected and is consistent with the experience of other countries that have significantly increased cash reserves in the banking system.", "Activity in the overnight cash market has also remained subdued, consistent with very high ES balances (Graph 3.12). Indeed, since November transaction volumes in the overnight cash market have been below the thresholds required to calculate the cash rate based on actual transactions almost half the time. In these instances, the published cash rate has been determined on the basis of the robust fall-back arrangements built into the cash rate procedures. Under these arrangements, the cash rate was published based on the last published cash rate on all but 2 instances. In these cases, the published cash rate was set at a different rate that, in the expert judgement of the Bank as the cash rate administrator, better reflected current market conditions.[3]", "Short-term money market rates are at historically low levels owing to the low level of the cash rate and the large amount of liquidity in the banking system (Graph 3.13). The rates on 3-month bank bills (BBSW) have edged lower to be around 1 basis point, slightly below the overnight indexed swap (OIS) rate. Following the reduction in the cash rate target and the remuneration on ES balances in November, repo rates at the Bank's daily market operations declined from 18 basis points to 10 basis points. Repo rates in the private interbank market also moved lower. The implied cost of borrowing Australian dollars via the foreign exchange swap market declined significantly into negative territory towards the end of the calendar year as liquidity in the foreign exchange swap market deteriorated. The implied cost has since retraced to be closer to zero. The temporary decline reflected abundant Australian dollar liquidity in the domestic money market and the propensity for offshore financial institutions to reduce the supply of US dollars towards the end of the calendar year to reduce the size of their balance sheets (see \u2018The International Environment\u2019 chapter); the reduced need by domestic financial institutions to swap US dollars into Australian dollars given lower offshore bond issuance also contributed.", "Issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) in 2020 was lower than in recent years, owing to the low level of issuance by banks. ABS issuance by non-ADIs increased in 2020, particularly in the second half of the year. As of September 2020, around half of the stock of Australian ABS outstanding had been issued by non-ADIs (Graph 3.14). Spreads relative to benchmark rates on residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) issued by non-ADIs declined over the year, but remained elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. Nonetheless, benchmark rates also declined significantly over 2020, causing yields on RMBS to decline to historically low levels. Spreads on ADI RMBS fell below the levels observed at the beginning of 2020, consistent with the decline in RMBS issuance by ADIs.", "Since the March announcement of the Structured Finance Support Fund (SFSF), the Australian Office of Finance Management (AOFM) has provided funding to securitisation warehouses and has invested directly in ABS in the primary and secondary markets. These measures supported the improvement of conditions in the ABS market since then. The AOFM has not intervened in primary or secondary markets since July, but continues to support the warehouse market and provide support via its forbearance special purpose vehicle.", "Australian banks' issuance of senior unsecured bonds was very low in 2020 (Graph 3.15). The low level of bond issuance reflected the availability of low-cost funding from the TFF, strong deposit growth and the moderate pace of overall asset growth.", "Banks continued to issue Tier 2 hybrid securities in 2020, raising $20 billion in this form. Hybrid securities have both equity and debt features and can be used to fulfil a part of regulatory capital requirements, which will increase in January 2024. Spreads on these Tier 2 hybrid issues were similar to those in 2019.", "Banks have continued to respond to the plentiful supply of funding at low rates by reducing deposit rates, including following the November Board meeting. Rates for new retail and wholesale deposits have declined by 10 basis points since the end of September (Graph 3.16).", "Over the past year or so, interest rates for new term deposits have declined by around 125 basis points, while rates for at-call deposits declined by around 50 basis points. The decline in the spread between interest rates on term deposits and other deposit rates is encouraging a shift by customers from term to at-call deposits. These changes have led to a rise in the share of bank deposits paying low interest rates (of between zero and 25 basis points). A little over one quarter of the debt funding of the major banks was estimated to be in the form of deposits paying interest of 25 basis points or less in the September quarter last year. This compares with around 15 per cent in late 2019. However, by value the majority of banks' deposits are still paying rates above 25 basis points, reflecting a sizeable share of deposits paying interest rates greater than 100 basis points.", "The Reserve Bank's policy measures have lowered banks' funding costs to historically low levels (Graph 3.17). Banks' non-equity funding costs are estimated to have declined by a similar amount to the cash rate since the end of February 2020. Much of the banks' wholesale debt and deposit costs are ultimately linked (either directly or via hedging) to BBSW rates, which have declined by around 80 basis points since the end of February 2020. Low-cost funding from the TFF and deposit inflows have reduced banks' need for new wholesale funding; while the cost of new 3-year bank bonds has declined, it remains higher than the rate on TFF borrowing. The additional policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank since late last year are expected to lower banks' funding costs a little further over the period ahead. This reflects the continued flow-through of the decline in BBSW rates to debt funding costs, ongoing reductions in banks' deposit rates and expected future drawdowns of the low-cost funding from the TFF.", "The deposit share of banks' total funding (including equity) has increased by around 4 percentage points since the end of February 2020 (Graph 3.18). Government bond purchases by the Reserve Bank and the banking sector have contributed to deposit growth, for example as payments for bonds purchased from the private (non-bank) sector are credited to the deposit accounts of those selling these bonds.[4] The rising shares of low-cost funding from the TFF and deposits are in line with the reduction in the share of wholesale debt funding.", "Following the Reserve Bank's decision to ease monetary policy further in November, a number of banks announced reductions in interest rates of between 30 and 75 basis points for new loans under the Government's SME loan guarantee scheme. A few banks announced reductions for some new loans to small businesses that are outside of the guarantee scheme.", "More generally, since monetary policy was first eased in response to the pandemic, interest rates on outstanding business loans have declined to historical lows (Graph 3.19). Interest rates on variable-rate loans to large businesses have declined by 85 basis points since the end of February 2020. Interest rates on variable-rate loans to small and medium-sized businesses have declined by around 80 basis points over the same period. Most of the reductions occurred between March and July 2020, although interest rates have drifted lower since then.", "A number of lenders reduced their housing lending rates following the package of monetary policy measures announced in early November last year. While some small lenders passed on the 15 basis point reduction in the cash rate target to their standard variable rates (SVRs) in full, the majority of lenders, including the major banks, did not reduce their variable housing rates (Graph 3.20). Instead, interest rate cuts of late have predominantly been for fixed-rate housing loans (Graph 3.21). The major banks, along with some other lenders, announced reductions in advertised fixed home-loan rates of between 10 and 110 basis points following the November Board meeting. Although most fixed-rate loans are for 2- or 3-year terms, the largest reductions in advertised rates of up to 110 basis points were for loans with 4-year terms. Some new fixed-rate loans are being advertised with interest rates of below 2 per cent.", "Over the past year or so, the interest rates paid by borrowers on housing loans have declined alongside the decline in banks' funding costs. Interest rates on outstanding variable-rate mortgages have declined by around 45 basis points since the end of February 2020 (Table 3.1). Much of that decline occurred in March and April last year, following the Reserve Bank's initial package of policy measures, as lenders reduced their SVRs by close to 30 basis points, on average. Outstanding variable rates have continued to drift down since then, reflecting ongoing competition for new high-quality borrowers and the associated effect of the elevated level of borrower refinancing.", "The rates paid by borrowers on new fixed-rate loans have declined by around 85 basis points since the end of last February, to be around 55\u201375 basis points below new variable interest rates at the end of December. This has encouraged new borrowers to take out fixed-rate loans and existing borrowers to refinance their loans at very low fixed interest rates. The proportion of new loans funded at fixed interest rates remains high by historical standards, and the stock of fixed-rate housing loans has risen by about 5 percentage points since the start of 2020 to account for around 25 per cent of housing credit outstanding.", "Total credit growth declined following the sharp rise in the early part of the pandemic (Graph 3.22; Table 3.2). This decline has mostly been driven by businesses repaying lines of credit that were initially drawn down over March and April to shore up liquidity positions during that especially uncertain period. Demand for business credit has been subdued since then (discussed further below). Meanwhile, growth in housing credit picked up a little in late 2020. This followed the easing of restrictions put in place to contain the virus, and has been supported by lower interest rates, government measures targeted at first home buyers and the HomeBuilder program.", "The stock of personal credit outstanding fell even more noticeably during the pandemic. Around half of the decline in personal credit between March and September was due to the decline in outstanding credit card debt, reflecting lower credit card spending by households and borrowers repaying this debt. Borrowers' capacity to repay debt was boosted by superannuation withdrawals and government assistance payments. More recently, spending on credit cards has increased a little as movement restrictions to contain the virus have been eased.", "Lending to businesses decreased over 2020, despite the sharp increase seen over March and April (Graph 3.23). Large businesses have, overall, gradually repaid the lines of credit that were initially drawn down as a precaution to shore up liquidity positions, and have taken out fewer loans for other purposes than in the period prior to the pandemic. Even so, the size of credit facilities available has increased significantly since the pandemic, suggesting that businesses are continuing to take a cautious approach to managing their access to liquidity. The volume of lending to SMEs has remained little changed over this time, with a pick-up in lending to the agriculture sector in 2020 offset by a decline in lending to other services (Graph 3.24).", "Demand for new loans is subdued despite historically low interest rates. Commitments for new business loans have declined since April to levels well below those seen before the pandemic, although they have stabilised somewhat in recent months (Graph 3.25). Survey data and liaison with businesses and banks suggest that businesses have been reluctant to take on debt given the uncertainty about the economic outlook. Businesses have also made use of a range of temporary government and loan payment deferral initiatives, which have helped to build up liquidity buffers and lessened the need for new loans. Around 65 per cent of large businesses surveyed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in October reported that they had enough cash to cover their expenses for at least the next 6 months, up from 50 per cent in June. In both June and October, over 35 per cent of the smaller businesses surveyed reported that they had sufficient cash for at least the next 6 months. Prior to the pandemic, around half of businesses had less than a month's worth of cash on hand to meet expenses.", "Within overall business loan commitments, however, those for new SME loans have increased a little of late, and are currently around the average level observed over the six months preceding the pandemic (Graph 3.26). Loan commitments for the purchase of property and for plant and equipment have contributed the most to the recent increase. Lending activity for plant and equipment has been supported by the Australian Government's enhancements to the instant asset tax write-off scheme announced in the 2020/21 budget.", "Take-up of the Australian Government's $40 billion SME loan guarantee scheme, which was put in place in late March 2020, has been low to date. About $3 billion of loan commitments have been made to around 30,000 businesses under the scheme. In October 2020, the scheme was made more generous to prospective borrowers in terms of how much could be borrowed, the use of collateral to secure the loan, and the repayment terms. The availability of funding at low cost through the scheme will help to support new lending should the demand from businesses pick up.", "Most loan repayment deferral arrangements on SME loans that were offered by banks in 2020 have now expired. The vast majority of SME borrowers that had a deferral in place have resumed repayments. As of the end of December 2020, just over 1 per cent of all small business loans by number still had a loan repayment deferral in place, down from a peak of around 13 per cent in June 2020.", "The availability of credit to businesses tightened in 2020, mostly for those business that have been more affected by the pandemic. Banks have reported in liaison that much of the tightening has reflected the application of existing lending standards in a weaker economic environment. In addition, banks have required a greater degree of verification of borrowers' information to better understand whether it is reasonable to extend a loan, given uncertainty about the economic outlook. Some banks continue to be cautious about lending to particular sectors \u2013 such as tourism, retail and commercial property \u2013 and to customers that are new to the bank.", "Surveys of small businesses indicate that access to finance became less difficult in the latter months of 2020 (Graph 3.27). However, at the same time, fewer businesses report that they have tried to access finance, consistent with subdued demand for credit. In late September, the Australian Government announced changes to responsible lending obligations intended to simplify the loan application process and reduce the extent of verification procedures. Enabling legislation was introduced to parliament in late 2020 and is currently under consideration. At the same time, ASIC has reiterated that consumer lending laws do not apply to small business lending.", "Bond issuance by non-financial corporations increased in 2020, driven by a pick-up in issuance from non-resource firms. Issuance in the domestic market was above average, and a much larger-than-usual share of bonds had a tenor of 10 years or longer (Graph 3.28). Liaison indicates that the low level of interest rates has increased demand for long-term bonds as investors have sought higher yields. Following a sharp increase early in 2020, corporate bond spreads declined over the second half of the year, to be around levels seen before the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Housing credit growth picked up towards the end of 2020, returning to around the same pace of growth experienced prior to the pandemic (3\u00be per cent on a 6-month-ended annualised basis). Loans to owner-occupiers have mostly driven the increase in late 2020, but investor housing credit also increased a little over the same period having declined over much of the year (Graph 3.29).", "Commitments for new housing loans rebounded sharply over the second half of the year to be 30 per cent above the levels seen in March 2020 (Graph 3.30). Lower interest rates, government measures targeted at first home buyers and the HomeBuilder program have all supported demand for housing finance. The increase is also consistent with an improvement in some housing market activity indicators such as auction clearance rates and turnover (see \u2018Domestic Economic Conditions\u2019 chapter). Banks have indicated in liaison that the increase in housing market activity over the second half of 2020 in part reflects pent-up demand; borrowers who found it difficult to purchase a property when restrictions were in place have since been able to do so. In Victoria, commitments for new loans have also increased over recent months following a gradual easing of the restrictions that were put in place to contain an outbreak of the virus between July and September.", "The availability of housing credit had tightened a little in response to the pandemic. However, in recent months, banks have begun to ease some requirements regarding additional information and have reduced the extent to which they have discounted highly variable sources of income (such as bonuses and commissions) when assessing a borrower's capacity to service a loan. Banks have also indicated more appetite for loans with higher loan-to-valuation ratios (LVRs).", "Overall, the major banks' market share of housing lending has decreased since 2017, while the shares of both other ADIs and non-ADI lenders have increased (Graph 3.31). Since the middle of last year, non-ADI lenders' share of housing credit has decreased slightly, although even within this group there has been considerable variation, with some non-ADI lenders increasing their share of housing credit.", "Mortgage borrowers have made substantial payments into offset and redraw accounts since March, amounting to 4 per cent of disposable income (around $40 billion) (Graph 3.32). The bulk of these funds have been placed into offset accounts (a type of deposit account linked to mortgages) and so do not reduce the measure of credit outstanding. Payments into redraw accounts, which do reduce the measure of credit outstanding, have also increased noticeably. The increase in payments is likely to reflect a combination of reduced opportunities for spending, mortgage holders saving for precautionary reasons, and some borrowers depositing cash received from early release superannuation and fiscal payments into these accounts.", "Net payments into redraw and offset accounts remain high but have eased a little over recent months, consistent with a tapering in fiscal payments, and a decline in the number of households that have accessed early release superannuation. The easing of restrictions in Victoria \u2013 allowing for more spending opportunities \u2013 may also have contributed.", "Over 2020, reductions in housing loan interest rates flowed through to borrowers in the form of lower interest payments (Graph 3.33). Since March, interest payments have declined by around \u00bd percentage point as a share of disposable income. This reflects the pass-through of the Bank's policy easing and borrowers refinancing to lower interest rates, as well as the strong growth in disposable income since that time.", "The share of mortgage holders with a repayment deferral arrangement in place declined to 2 per cent at the end of December 2020, from a peak of 8 per cent at the end of June. Banks announced 6-month loan payment deferrals in March 2020 to provide support for borrowers impacted by the pandemic, most of which were due to expire between September and October. Since September, around 85 per cent of borrowers that have exited their deferral arrangement have agreed to resume full payments. The remaining share are mostly made up of borrowers who have had their deferrals extended, and a small share have had hardship arrangements put in place (2 per cent of those exiting deferral arrangements).", "The ASX 200 has increased further over recent months to be around 2 per cent below its February 2020 peak on a total return basis, which takes dividends into account. The rebound in global equity prices since March last year reflects the recovery in the global economy and the related monetary and fiscal stimulus, along with an improvement in sentiment as effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed (Graph 3.34). On a total return basis, the ASX 200 has performed broadly in line with other overseas equity markets. The stronger growth of the S&P 500 over the past year partly reflects the strength of technology stocks, which have a much larger weight in the US index.", "Equity prices in the resources sector are almost back to their previous peak in early 2020 and have contributed much of the rise in the ASX 200 since March (Graph 3.35). In recent months, major miners performed strongly on the back of higher iron ore prices, amid tighter than expected supply and increased demand for iron ore from China. Equity prices of oil companies increased alongside supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The financial sector underperformed the ASX 200 index in recent months, consistent with developments in other advanced economies. It remains around 12 per cent below its February 2020 peak, in part reflecting substantial loan loss provisions. Equity prices for companies outside the financial and resources sectors are around 5 per cent below their peak in early 2020. The information technology sector has performed strongly over the past year, as companies have benefited from the shift to working from home and the pick-up in growth of online sales.", "Listed companies issued over $65 billion of new equity in 2020, the most since 2009, as companies shored up their balance sheets again at a time of great uncertainty (Graph 3.36). Companies that were most affected by the pandemic, such as travel and industrial companies, raised significantly more capital than their historical average. More recently, some firms have raised capital for mergers and acquisitions. The value of pending mergers and acquisitions increased sharply in the December quarter, as firms seek to acquire competitors that have lower values of market capitalisation than before the outbreak of COVID-19.", "The Australian dollar has appreciated by around 5 per cent on a trade-weighted (TWI) basis since early November, and is higher than its level prior to the onset of the pandemic. The appreciation since November has been noticeable against the US dollar (Graph 3.37). This has occurred against the backdrop of the general improvement in expectations for the recovery in global growth, which has seen the US dollar depreciate and many commodity prices increase markedly (Graph 3.38). In particular, the price of iron ore has increased by around 30 per cent since early November and is around its highest level since 2013 (see \u2018The International Environment\u2019 chapter).", "Interest rates on government bonds in Australia have been little changed relative to those in other major advanced economies since the previous Statement. However, Australian interest rates did decline relative to those abroad in the months leading up to the introduction of the Reserve Bank's package of policy measures introduced in November. Following the recent announcement of the extension to the bond purchase program, the Australian dollar has been little changed. However, given the lower structure of interest rates in the domestic economy associated with the Bank's policy measures over the past year, the exchange rate is lower than otherwise.", "Australia continued to be a net lender of capital in the September quarter with capital outflows exceeding capital inflows (Graph 3.39). This is in line with Australia recording a current account surplus (see \u2018Domestic Economic Conditions\u2019 chapter). Outflows were related to a decline in the outstanding stock of debt issued abroad by Australian banks, consistent with their access to low-cost funding domestically from the TFF and the moderate pace of growth in their assets. Outflows also reflected superannuation and investment funds purchasing foreign equities. Partly offsetting this was inflows of capital to Australia from foreign purchases of Australian Government debt.", "Despite a small increase in the September quarter, Australia's net foreign liability position remains around its lowest level as a per cent of GDP since the 1990s. The decline in the net foreign liability position over the past 4 years reflects the increase in the net foreign equity asset position that has occurred over this period as superannuation funds have increased their allocations to foreign equity (Graph 3.40)."], "Box A: Consumption Patterns and Consumer Price Index Weights": ["Restrictions on activity and discretionary decisions by households in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to changes in consumer spending patterns. These changes have in turn been reflected in the way the ABS calculates the Consumer Price Index (CPI). As household expenditure patterns continue to adjust to the pandemic and policy measures evolve, further larger-than-usual changes to CPI weights could occur over the next couple of years to ensure the index still provides an accurate and relevant measure of prices faced by households.", "Household spending patterns shifted considerably in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated activity restrictions. For example, during the initial phase of the pandemic in March and April 2020, spending at cafes & restaurants fell markedly as people avoided public gatherings and restrictions on eating out were imposed (Graph A.1). This was largely offset by increased spending on groceries for consumption at home. There was also a very strong increase in spending on many types of household durables, including home entertainment and computer equipment, appliances, recreational goods, furniture and home renovation goods. In contrast, spending on new motor vehicles, clothing & footwear and a range of other household services declined.", "As restrictions eased across most of Australia, expenditure patterns began returning towards pre-pandemic shares for some items, such as clothing & footwear and alcohol consumed at venues. However, some changes to consumption patterns of other categories of goods and services have persisted. Purchases of food and drink for consumption at home remained elevated in the September quarter 2020, while spending at cafes & restaurants remained much lower than prior to the pandemic. A particularly large change was spending on international travel for holidays and education; this had accounted for around 5 per cent of household consumption in recent years, but fell to very low levels due to international border restrictions (Graph A.2).", "The ABS has captured these larger-than-usual shifts in household consumption patterns in the CPI by adjusting the relative weights of the various expenditure categories. Re-weighting ensures the CPI remains an accurate measure of household price inflation. In recent years, the ABS had been updating the weights in the CPI annually to reflect the consumption shares observed in the previous year's Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) estimates. Because of the unusually large changes in spending patterns since the outbreak of COVID-19, for the 2020 re-weighting the ABS has supplemented the HFCE estimates with a range of more timely data sources, such as supermarket scanner data.[1] Expenditure weights for around one-fifth of the CPI basket have been estimated using timelier data sources, including for grocery food, alcohol, electricity and domestic and international travel.", "Consistent with the very large fall in expenditure on both international and domestic airfares, the weight applied to travel prices fell substantially (Graph A.3). International holiday travel, which made up around 3 per cent of the CPI basket as at the end 2019, now comprises less than 0.1 per cent of the CPI. The decline in the weight assigned to international travel has meant that the share of tradable items in the consumption basket has continued its long-run decline, to be now less than one-third of the CPI (Graph A.4). The largest increases in expenditure weights over the past year were for groceries, consumer durables and new dwellings, with market services retaining the largest weight in the CPI.", "Although some of these changes represent unusually large annual adjustments, in absolute terms the changes to individual expenditure weights are still only around 1\u20132 percentage points. Accordingly, these weight changes have not affected our overall assessment of current and future inflation (see \u2018Economic Outlook\u2019 chapter). Where a larger weight applies to an expenditure category with a faster (or slower) rate of inflation, this will increase (or decrease) aggregate inflation measures by a small amount. There could also be larger-than-usual updates to CPI weights over the next couple of years as household expenditure patterns continue to adjust to the pandemic and related policy measures. The ABS has indicated it will continue to monitor spending patterns using timely data in order to ensure that the CPI reflects the actual composition of household consumption. These weight adjustments may add some volatility to CPI outcomes over the next couple of years, but these effects are likely to be small relative to other factors shaping the inflation outlook."], "1. The International Environment": ["Following a strong rebound in global activity in the September quarter, the economic recovery lost a little momentum late last year following a resurgence of COVID-19 infections and a significant tightening in activity restrictions in some economies. But in China and a small number of other economies where infection numbers have remained low, economic activity has rebounded strongly to pre-pandemic levels. The unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response continues to support activity in many economies, including in Australia.", "The approval of a number of effective vaccines in recent months raises the prospect of a more rapid improvement in health outcomes, but it will take some time for vaccines to be rolled out on a sufficient scale to contain the virus. While global growth forecasts for the coming year have increased a little relative to the November Statement on Monetary Policy, the significant disruption to the global economy from the pandemic, and consequent substantial spare productive capacity, is likely to keep inflation low for some time.", "Monetary policy settings remain very accommodative globally and central banks have indicated that they will remain so for some time. Broader financial conditions continue to support economic growth. Credit risk premiums have narrowed, equity prices have rallied and investment flows to emerging markets have increased. These developments reflect positive sentiment around the ongoing rollout of vaccines, new fiscal stimulus measures, as well as expectations of ongoing monetary policy accommodation. Sovereign bond yields remain at historically low levels, although they have risen in a number of countries, reflecting expectations of further fiscal stimulus and the improvement in the outlook.", "The resurgence in COVID-19 cases since late last year has affected many economies and a number have seen hospitalisations surpass their earlier peaks (Graph 1.1). Containment measures have been tightened and extended in many locations. In parts of Western Europe, lockdown measures have become almost as restrictive as they were during the initial wave of the pandemic and are likely to remain in place for much of the Northern Hemisphere winter. The rollout of vaccines should start to reduce the effects of the virus, but just how quickly this occurs will depend on the speed of production and distribution. Access to vaccines is currently very limited in most emerging market economies.", "The resurgence in infections and the tightening of containment measures dampened economic activity around the turn of the year (Graph 1.2). Population mobility has remained well below pre-pandemic levels (Graph 1.3). Nevertheless, the economic impact of the resurgence of infections and associated lockdowns is expected to be smaller than during the initial outbreak. There are various reasons for this: current lockdowns are generally more targeted; businesses and households have adapted to carrying on economic activity during lockdown conditions; and personal protective equipment (PPE) is more readily available. Consumer spending will also be supported by ongoing fiscal and monetary policy measures and the prospect of the pandemic moving into a less disruptive phase as mass vaccinations roll out. To date, reported GDP outcomes for the December quarter have been stronger than expected in many economies.", "The resilience in goods demand supported the recovery in global goods trade and industrial production during the second part of 2020 (Graph 1.4). This partly reflects consumers substituting towards goods as spending on consumer services has fallen. Demand for electronics has been especially strong, driven by remote working. This has boosted exports from China and other east Asian economies, as the region is a significant producer of semi-conductors and other electronics. A shortage of shipping capacity from Asia has lengthened supplier delivery times to other regions and the broader recovery in goods consumption has pushed up producer input prices globally.", "Some of the political tensions of recent years that affected global trade are in a period of transition. The European Union and the United Kingdom reached a trade agreement in late December, which should limit large-scale disruptions to a key trading relationship following Brexit. Meanwhile, it is yet to be seen how the US\u2013China trade relationship will evolve under the new US Administration following years of significant trade tensions. China appears unlikely to have met their purchase commitments under the \u2018Phase One\u2019 trade deal with the United States; as of November, China had only met a little over half of the 2020 target.", "The broad-based strength in east Asian goods exports has supported growth in the region (Graph 1.5). Demand from China has been resilient and exports to the major advanced economies surpassed pre-pandemic levels by November 2020. However, the recovery in domestic spending has been slowed by a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and tighter containment measures across the region. Population mobility associated with retail and entertainment activity has declined in most of these economies since late 2020 (Graph 1.6).", "After contracting sharply in early 2020, the Chinese economy has largely recovered, growing by 6.5 per cent in 2020 in year-ended terms. Activity is now well above pre-pandemic levels in most parts of the economy. This economic resilience has stemmed from China's ability to avoid large-scale outbreaks of the virus since early 2020 and to effectively target economic policy support measures. The early stages of the recovery were driven by construction-related investment and production, partly because fiscal spending was largely directed towards infrastructure projects. Consistent with this, production of construction-related products, such as steel, rose notably over 2020 (Graph 1.7). Fixed asset investment also continued to recover in the December quarter, albeit moderating from the very high growth rates seen earlier in the year.", "Consumption continued to recover in the December quarter and consumption patterns have begun to normalise. Household consumption of essential items, such as food and rental services, remained relatively stable over 2020, while consumption of discretionary services, such as eating out and cultural & entertainment services, only reached pre-pandemic levels in the December quarter. Consumption of these services could decline again if restrictions are tightened materially in response to the small resurgence of COVID-19 cases in north-east China.", "Chinese export growth picked up over 2020 and contributed significantly to overall growth (Graph 1.8). Among the drivers of this growth in exports has been strong global demand for goods and the swift rebound in industrial production in China. Earlier in 2020 demand was strongest for PPE, medical supplies and computers; more recently the growth has been more broad based. Imports also picked up in the second half of 2020, but by a smaller margin than exports.", "Financial conditions in China continue to support growth and employment. The People's Bank of China (PBC) is maintaining a moderately accommodative monetary policy stance as it seeks to balance assistance for China's economic recovery with limiting the build-up of risks in the financial system.", "Chinese policymakers have overseen some tightening of conditions in financial markets alongside the economic recovery so far, while maintaining other stimulatory policies. In particular, bank lending rates and reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) remain low, and a raft of other measures aimed at encouraging the flow of credit to small and private businesses remain in place (Graph 1.9). These measures saw growth in total social financing (TSF) increase over 2020, consistent with the stated goal of authorities to support the recovery with notably higher credit growth (Graph 1.10). The faster pace of TSF growth over 2020 was also partly driven by strong issuance of government bonds, a high share of which was related to infrastructure activity. This was partly offset by a reduction in lending by the more opaque channels of the financial system, following actions by regulators.", "Though corporate financing conditions remain accommodative in general, there was a tightening in the corporate bond market around the turn of the year. Corporate bond spreads rose and issuance became more difficult following defaults in November by several enterprises owned by local governments, which have historically benefited from substantial government support (Graph 1.11). Authorities have warned that more defaults will occur in the future to help ensure that markets price risks appropriately.", "Authorities have affirmed that reducing risk in the financial system remains a key policy objective and that it will be necessary to tighten monetary conditions further at some point during the recovery. However, authorities have also emphasised that any reduction in policy accommodation will be gradual. In particular, policymakers have indicated that targeted measures supporting certain segments of the economy such as smaller firms are likely to stay in place for some time. TSF growth is expected to moderate over 2021 as authorities aim to keep overall debt levels in the economy stable relative to GDP.", "The renminbi has appreciated since mid last year reflecting the recovery in Chinese economic activity and higher interest rates relative to those of advanced economies, which have encouraged bond and equity inflows. This has occurred alongside a broad-based depreciation in the US dollar, and the renminbi has appreciated by around 11 per cent against the US dollar to its highest level since 2018 (Graph 1.12).", "Capital inflows have also been associated with China's inclusion in some global fixed income benchmarks last year and gradual improvements in foreign access to securities markets. Foreign holdings of renminbi-denominated assets have increased further, although foreign participation remains low by international standards (Graph 1.13). Since the beginning of the year, authorities have eased restrictions on Chinese cross-border lending and tightened restrictions for cross-border borrowing, while quotas for portfolio investment abroad have been increased. These adjustments have been consistent with the stated goals of promoting a two-way opening of the capital account and having a more flexible, market-determined exchange rate.", "In India, the pace of economic recovery has strengthened alongside a decline in COVID-19 cases and a further relaxation of restrictions. Following severe disruptions during India's initial lockdown, industrial production has continued to recover and steel production is now around pre-pandemic levels. Steel demand is supporting an increase in demand for Australian coking coal exports to India (Graph 1.14; see \u2018Domestic Economic Conditions\u2019 chapter). Nonetheless, overall economic activity is still below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in parts of the services sector.", "To date, concerns around fiscal space and high inflation have limited the amount of fiscal and monetary support provided by the Indian authorities. However, the recent Indian budget suggests fiscal expenditure will increase this year and further declines in headline inflation, as currently forecast, could provide scope for further monetary policy easing if required.", "The ongoing recovery in industrial production in China and parts of Asia is supporting the price of commodities, including some key exports for Australia. Iron ore, coal and oil-related commodity prices have all increased sharply over the past 3 months, and most other commodity prices are also higher. That said, momentum in some commodity prices has moderated more recently.", "The benchmark iron ore price has increased by around 30 per cent since the previous Statement (Table 1.1). Although the price has eased a little since late January, it remains around its highest level since 2013 (Graph 1.15). This has reflected ongoing strength in Chinese steel production and supply issues, including a weaker outlook for Brazilian production and, to a lesser extent, scheduled maintenance and weather-related disruptions in Australian supply. The surge in prices in December prompted China's Dalian Commodity Exchange to tighten limits on trading, reportedly to address speculative activity in the iron ore futures market.", "The Newcastle thermal coal spot price has increased sharply since late 2020 because of stronger demand outside China and previous disruptions to Australian supply arising from weather-related damage to port infrastructure. Coking coal prices have also increased sharply in recent weeks but remain at a significant discount relative to domestic Chinese prices, partly reflecting uncertainty surrounding Chinese demand for Australian coal. Higher demand for coking coal elsewhere, particularly from India, has provided support to prices.", "The price of Brent crude oil has increased by around 45 per cent since the previous Statement and is now back around levels observed prior to the onset of the pandemic (Graph 1.16). The price received by Australian Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exporters is linked to oil prices with a lag and will therefore increase over the next couple of quarters. The Asian LNG spot price spiked to a record level in mid January following strong Northern Hemisphere winter demand and concerns of a global supply shortfall. The price has since decreased, amid an easing in peak demand and greater availability of spot cargoes.", "Economic activity at the end of 2020 remained below pre-pandemic levels across advanced economies. Significant spare capacity remains in labour markets in advanced economies despite the rebound in global activity in the September quarter. The extent of this shortfall has varied across economies, depending on health outcomes and the stringency of restrictions, the size of the services sector (which has faced significant headwinds throughout the pandemic) and the scale of fiscal and monetary support.", "Wage subsidy programs have operated in many advanced economies throughout the pandemic, with the United States a key exception. These subsidies have supported the retention of workers and kept many businesses afloat. In line with the intent of these programs, the labour market adjustment in these economies has occurred largely through a reduction in average hours worked rather than a fall in employment (Graph 1.17). This has resulted in a smaller increase in unemployment rates than otherwise. The number of workers supported by wage subsidies had significantly fallen by mid last year, but reliance on these programs has increased again in some economies that have tightened containment measures.", "Spare capacity in labour markets, evident in broad measures of underutilisation, will weigh on wages growth and underlying inflation for some time. While inflation in the prices of goods has picked up in most advanced economies since June, reflecting both supply disruptions and increased demand, this has been offset by disinflation in services prices; services inflation has been volatile due to policy changes to support spending in the sector, including temporary consumption tax reductions. In the case of headline inflation, the increase in oil prices since November will provide a boost, but the effects will be offset in part by the significant easing in food inflation as production disruptions have subsided.", "Inflation remains low. It is expected to pick up towards central bank targets, but only very gradually as the global recovery gains traction and spare capacity in labour markets is eventually absorbed. Market-based and economists' inflation expectations have increased (Graph 1.18). Prospects of significantly more expansionary US fiscal policy in recent months and very accommodative monetary policy have also supported the increase in market-based inflation expectations.", "Fiscal policy has provided critical support to household and business incomes throughout the pandemic, particularly in advanced economies. This support is likely to be required for some time as a result of the latest upswing in COVID-19 infections, the recent period of intensive lockdowns and the significant amount of spare capacity remaining in many economies.", "European governments have increased fiscal support measures, mainly through extended wage subsidies and business transfers. The US authorities approved a further large expansion of fiscal policy (4 per cent of GDP) in late 2020, which extended unemployment benefits, reintroduced forgivable loans to businesses that maintain employment levels and provided another round of direct transfers to households (Graph 1.19). The prospects of a further fiscal expansion have increased significantly after the Democrats secured a majority in both chambers of the United States Congress. Many advanced economies have announced substantial funding for their mass vaccination programs. And some economies, including Japan, the European Union and Canada, have announced very sizeable fiscal policy measures for the recovery phase that emphasise \u2018green\u2019 and digital investment.", "Monetary policy settings in advanced economies remain highly accommodative and are expected to remain so for some time given significant spare capacity and subdued outlooks for inflation. Indeed, in recent months, several central banks have extended the timeframe for which existing monetary stimulus will be in place. The European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of England (BoE), Bank of Japan (BoJ) and Swedish Riksbank recently expanded the size of their asset purchase programs and extended their horizon until the end of 2021 or later (Table 1.2). The Chair of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) indicated that, consistent with the Fed's updated forward guidance, any tapering of Fed asset purchases was unlikely in the near term, and would be gradual and signalled well ahead of time.", "A number of central banks have also made changes to their lending facilities, or launched new facilities, to encourage the flow of credit to the real economy (Graph 1.20). The ECB extended by a year the period during which banks will receive a discounted interest rate on borrowings under its term funding scheme and increased the borrowing limit. The BoE extended the duration of its term funding scheme by 6 months to October 2021, while the BoJ extended the duration of its lending facilities and removed the upper limit on loans provided to each bank for some facilities. Also, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) introduced a Funding for Lending Programme (FLP). The FLP will provide funding for 3-year terms at a floating interest rate equal to the prevailing policy rate, with the borrowing limit tied to a bank's volume of lending to the non-financial private sector.", "While broad-based stimulus is expected to continue for some time, central banks have continued to scale back measures aimed at alleviating dysfunction or supporting the flow of credit in particular markets as conditions in these markets have improved. A number of Fed emergency lending facilities were closed in December (Graph 1.21). The ECB reduced its holdings of commercial paper and has lowered the pace of private sector asset purchases. The Bank of Canada (BoC) discontinued its purchases of provincial money market securities, and reduced its primary market purchases of Treasury Bills.", "Central banks continue to signal that policy rates will remain at very low levels until there is sustained progress towards employment and inflation goals. In the United States, most members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expect the policy rate to remain unchanged until at least 2023, consistent with forward guidance that the policy rate will not be increased until the labour market has reached maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 per cent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 per cent for some time. In Europe and Japan, rates are expected to remain at current or lower levels for the foreseeable future. In the United Kingdom market pricing suggests that the BoE will lower the policy rate by 10 basis points to zero per cent by end 2021 (Graph 1.22). In New Zealand, market participants expect the policy rate to remain unchanged in 2021.", "Some central banks will undertake or announce the results of reviews of monetary policy frameworks and tools in the coming year. An independent review of the BoE's approach to quantitative easing (QE) found that the programs had been delivered effectively, but recommended more work to improve technical understanding and build public understanding and trust in QE as a monetary policy tool. Meanwhile, the BoJ is reviewing the sustainability of its policy measures given that it has accumulated a large share of equity exchange traded funds and government bonds on issue. The ECB expects to conclude its monetary policy strategy review in the second half of the year.", "Long-term government bond yields have increased in most advanced economies since the end of November (Graph 1.23). This is partly because the economic outlook has improved, related to the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, although this has been tempered by rising COVID-19 cases and new containment measures in some economies. Expectations of new fiscal stimulus measures, particularly in the United States, have also contributed to higher government bond yields.", "The recent rise in government bond yields has mostly been reflected in an increase in inflation compensation, whereas real yields have declined or remained stable at low levels (Graph 1.24). This is consistent with expectations that policy rates will not be raised until there is a substantial and sustained increase in inflation, in line with strong forward guidance from central banks, most notably the Fed.", "Sovereign debt issuance is expected to remain elevated to fund ongoing fiscal deficits. Most major central banks have purchased (in secondary markets) the equivalent of more than half of net government debt issuance since the start of the pandemic, which has contributed to keeping bond yields low and stable (Graph 1.25; Graph 1.26). In most cases, central banks have indicated that they expect to continue purchasing at around the same pace until at least the end of 2021, which is likely to comprise a significant share of new issuance this year.", "Corporate funding conditions have been supported by expectations that widespread vaccination will allow economic activity to normalise in the second half of 2021, alongside ongoing fiscal and monetary support. Conditions have improved further despite the recent resurgence in infections and containment measures in a number of major economies.", "Corporate bond yields and credit spreads have declined further in recent months (Graph 1.27). Borrowing costs are currently around record lows in the United States and Europe, and issuance conditions remain favourable for both investment grade and sub-investment grade borrowers.", "Equity prices have increased significantly over recent months. Bank share prices have outperformed other sectors, especially in the United States, amid a substantial recovery in profits for the December quarter (Graph 1.28). The improved economic outlook is expected to support bank profits via lower loan losses (and loss provisioning), a steeper yield curve and potentially greater lending activity. Bank share prices have also benefited from an easing in restrictions on share buybacks in a number of countries. In the United States, shares in a number of small companies experienced sizeable swings in prices in early 2021 alongside heightened retail investor activity. As a result of this volatility, brokers faced significantly higher margin requirements to clear equity trades in certain companies; in response, some online brokers restricted purchases of these shares to reduce their own exposures.", "Conditions in short-term US dollar funding markets remain accommodative. The cost of borrowing US dollars in foreign exchange swap markets increased towards the end of 2020, although year-end funding pressures were less acute than in some previous years. These funding pressures can emerge because regulatory factors discourage large banks in the United States and Europe from intermediating activity over the year-end period. In contrast, unsecured borrowing rates in US onshore markets remained low and stable over this period (Graph 1.29).", "The US dollar has depreciated further on a trade-weighted (TWI) basis since early November and is around 11 per cent lower than its peak in March 2020 (Graph 1.30). Since early November, the depreciation of the US dollar has been consistent with expectations of a stronger recovery in global growth and a general improvement in risk sentiment.", "The euro has been little changed over recent months, while the UK pound appreciated in the lead-up to the post-Brexit trade deal that was reached in December; even so the UK pound remains well below its level prior to the Brexit referendum in 2016. The currencies of most other advanced economies, including Australia, have also appreciated over recent months (see \u2018Domestic Financial Conditions\u2019 chapter for recent developments in the Australian dollar).", "Financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs) have improved in recent months. Policy rates for most EMEs have been little changed at low levels and a number of EME central banks have indicated that the scope for further policy easing is limited. Yields on bonds denominated in local currency remain around record lows for most EMEs, despite recent increases in Latin America. Equity prices have risen further, there have been large investment inflows and currencies have generally appreciated against the US dollar. Spreads on government and corporate bonds denominated in US dollars have continued to narrow but remain above their pre-pandemic levels.", "Financial conditions in emerging Asia have generally been more favourable than in other regions over the past year (Graph 1.31). That is because the region has benefited from the recovery in global trade and production as well as having entered the crisis with stronger fundamentals than other regions, including stronger economic growth and more fiscal space.", "Some EMEs remain vulnerable to changing conditions related to the health and economic crisis. While there has been a general improvement in financial conditions since the onset of the pandemic, they remain tighter for more vulnerable EMEs, most notably South Africa and Turkey. Developments over the past year in these 2 countries have exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities such as weak economic growth, large fiscal deficits and reliance on external financing.", "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has continued to expand its provision of financial assistance. In general, IMF lending is beginning to transition from emergency support to longer-term, reform-based programs. In recognition of the particular challenges faced by low-income countries, G20 members agreed upon a common framework to guide the restructuring of official sector debt in those countries facing debt distress.", "A successful rollout of mass vaccinations globally should allow a durable unwinding of social distancing measures and an increase in economic activity over the course of 2021. Even still, the level of global economic activity is expected to remain below its pre-pandemic trajectory which will keep inflationary pressures low and mean that fiscal and monetary policy support will be required for some time.", "Australia's major trading partners' GDP is expected to grow by 7 per cent in 2021 and by 4\u00bd per cent in 2022 in year-average terms (Graph 1.32). The outlook is a little stronger than at the time of the November Statement. Part of this upgrade stems from a better starting point: activity was generally stronger than expected in the September quarter and recent virus outbreaks do not appear to have fully offset this. Further out, improved prospects for the mass rollout of vaccines have also contributed to a stronger outlook.", "However, the outlook remains highly uncertain due to near-term pandemic developments, the effectiveness of the rollout of vaccinations and uncertainty around the path and traction of future policy support:", "Overall, global economic activity is expected to recover faster than in a typical recession because much of the weakness has been the result of mandated constraints rather than weak demand. Also, in many advanced economies the scarring effects on the labour market are likely to have been more limited than usual because of proactive fiscal and monetary policy responses. Support for private incomes, constrained consumption opportunities and precautionary motives have led to a considerable build-up in savings, which could significantly boost consumption when the pandemic recedes.", "Despite the more positive outlook, the sheer scale of the economic contraction in the first half of 2020 will mean that global activity and labour markets will take considerable time to recover. The global recovery will also remain uneven. In a small number of economies, including China and the United States, the level of GDP is expected to have recovered to around its pre-pandemic trajectory by the end of 2022. But for many others, the pandemic is expected to have a longer lasting effect on activity. This is particularly the case for some emerging market economies that have had less policy flexibility in responding to the crisis and/or that face significant challenges in administering large scale vaccine programs (Graph 1.33).", "Some economies may have to tighten containment measures further or keep them in place for longer, which raises near-term downside risks. Challenges posed by virus mutations are increasing, as more contagious variants of the virus are spreading globally and the high level of infections increases the possibility that further new mutations may emerge.", "Further out, the outlook assumes that vulnerability to the virus in advanced economies will have fallen significantly by the second half of 2021 owing to the rollout of vaccinations. Achieving this time frame will require significant mobilisation of resources.", "Fiscal policy could be significantly more expansionary than expected, especially in the United States, which should boost growth but may also put upward pressure on bond yields and tighten financial conditions. Conversely, a premature winding-down of policy support could precipitate a downturn before the recovery was complete."], "Overview": ["The successful development of COVID-19 vaccines has improved the medium-term outlook for global growth. Vaccination programs are underway in a number of countries. As these are rolled out, health-related restrictions can be eased and many types of activity can return to something close to their pre-pandemic trends. In the near term, however, some momentum in the global economy has been lost, as infection rates have surged in a number of economies and lockdown measures have again become necessary. The recovery is likely to be bumpy and uneven, and dependent both on the health situation and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support. Spare capacity will remain for some years, dampening inflationary pressures.", "The domestic economic recovery has run faster than previously expected. This has been consistent with the pattern seen globally, of unexpectedly fast (but partial) recoveries after lockdown measures were lifted, as well as Australia's relatively better health outcomes. Fiscal policy has supported household and business cashflows, and the Victorian lockdown measures weighed less on economic activity than earlier assumed. Consumption has recovered faster, and dwelling and business investment have not been as weak as had been anticipated.", "The Bank's forecasts have been revised to incorporate this stronger starting point. GDP is expected to have contracted by 2 per cent over 2020, a smaller decline than earlier anticipated. Growth of around 3\u00bd per cent is expected over each of 2021 and 2022 as the recovery progresses.", "In line with this recovery in activity, the labour market has also performed better than expected. Employment grew strongly over the latter part of 2020, and the unemployment rate declined to 6.6 per cent in December. Although underemployment remains high, the sharp increase during the height of the activity restrictions has mostly reversed. The participation rate has already returned to the historic highs seen just prior to the pandemic. But over 900,000 Australians remain unemployed, around 220,000 more than at the onset of the pandemic. Employment is likewise yet to recover completely \u2013 especially full-time employment \u2013 and some workers are still on reduced hours. This shortfall is particularly evident in the industries that have been most affected by health-related restrictions on activity and travel.", "The outlook for the labour market has improved as a result of the better starting point and growth outlook. It now appears that the unemployment rate has already peaked. Although the end of the JobKeeper program in March creates some uncertainty for the near term, over the whole forecast period employment growth is expected to remain solid, consistent with the ongoing recovery in activity. The unemployment rate is expected to continue declining, but will still be around 6 per cent at the end of this year and 5\u00bd per cent at the end of next year, reaching around 5\u00bc per cent by mid 2023.", "Headline inflation has been volatile since the pandemic started. The introduction and subsequent reversal of various temporary policy support measures, such as free child care, have resulted in large price movements. Working in the opposite direction, prices of some retail items, especially household goods, were initially boosted in response to strong demand and supply disruptions. Most of these effects have now run their course. Housing-related inflation increased a little, as discounting of the prices of newly built homes eased in response to strong demand, and some temporary rent reductions expired.", "Underlying inflation pressures remain subdued and are expected to be fairly muted in the period ahead. Spare capacity in the labour market remains elevated, and wages growth has eased further from already low rates. Many employers have responded to the economic challenges of the pandemic by delaying wage increases, imposing wage freezes and, in some cases, applying temporary wage cuts. Forward indicators suggest wages growth will remain soft this year.", "Both underlying price inflation and wages growth are expected to remain below 2 per cent over the forecast period, out to mid 2023. Trimmed mean inflation is expected to be 1\u00bc per cent over 2021 and 1\u00bd per cent over 2022. For inflation to be sustainably within the Bank's target range of 2\u20133 per cent, a period of labour market tightness that leads to faster wages growth is needed. However, even the latest, upgraded, forecasts for economic activity and employment still imply a degree of spare capacity and slow wages growth over coming years.", "The bounce-back in the Australian economy would not have been possible without the successful public health outcomes. Even so, the speed of the recovery has also underlined the importance of timely and substantial policy support. The JobKeeper program preserved employment relationships and supported the incomes of both households and businesses. Increased social assistance payments, temporary rent relief and loan repayment deferrals have also assisted, as did the lower debt-servicing costs resulting from the monetary policy measures.", "Unusually for a period of rising unemployment, both household income and business profits increased. This supported the sharp recovery in household consumption, after many types of spending were constrained by health-related restrictions in the June quarter. How spending responds to the tapering of some fiscal support measures remains a source of uncertainty for the outlook.", "Policy support has also been instrumental in moderating the declines in housing and business investment. Demand for detached houses has been brought forward in response to various government incentives. Tax incentives have also encouraged business investment in machinery & equipment, though business investment has been soft for some time and is still expected to lag the broader economic recovery. The outlook for public investment has strengthened, with several states foreshadowing a considerable increase in expenditure in their recent budgets.", "Experience overseas has also highlighted the role of fiscal and monetary policy support, both during upsurges in infection rates and once the health situation improves. Governments in several countries have announced additional fiscal support packages in recent months, in response to renewed virus outbreaks or to support the economic recovery. Several central banks have recently increased the size and/or extended the timeframe of their asset purchase programs. Some have also introduced or enhanced lending facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has induced considerable shifts in the pattern of demand, most notably away from services, which have been most affected by activity restrictions, towards goods. This has supported a rapid recovery in global trade and industrial production. The export sectors in China and some other Asian economies have therefore expanded strongly, particularly for producers of semiconductors and household goods. These economies have also benefited from relatively good control over the virus, so their domestic economic recoveries are also generally more advanced than elsewhere.", "The strong rebound in industrial demand has supported an increase in commodity prices in recent months. Strong growth in Chinese steel production, both for industrial uses and domestic construction, has boosted iron ore prices and thus Australia's terms of trade. It has also put upward pressure on the value of the Australian dollar, which is in the upper end of the range of recent years.", "As in previous Statements, the forecasts are presented in the form of 3 scenarios, this time representing different outcomes related to the spread of the virus and the rollout of vaccines. The degree of uncertainty on this dimension has narrowed as the Australian public health system has prevented several small outbreaks from spreading more widely. The baseline forecast assumes that no further large outbreaks of COVID-19 occur in Australia, though there could be a few small outbreaks on the scale seen over the past couple of months. Domestic activity restrictions are assumed to ease over the course of this year. Australia's international borders are assumed to remain closed until at least the end of the year.", "In the downside scenario, further large outbreaks require broad activity restrictions to be reimposed, though not the extended lockdowns contemplated in previous downside scenarios. In this scenario, the unemployment rate remains just below 7 per cent for most of 2021 and declines only gradually thereafter.", "The upside scenario assumes a sequence of positive health outcomes that enable a faster easing of restrictions on activity and boost confidence and thus spending. The unemployment rate would fall more quickly under this scenario, falling below 5 per cent by the end of next year. Inflation would also rise a little faster, but would still be below 2 per cent by end of the forecast period in mid 2023.", "Monetary policy has helped support the economy by ensuring that financial conditions remain highly accommodative. The Bank announced another package of monetary policy measures in November. This included lower rates for the cash rate target, bond yield target, Term Funding Facility and remuneration on exchange settlement balances. It also included a program to purchase $100 billion of government bonds over a period of about 6 months.", "Last year's monetary policy package is working broadly as expected and is supporting the economy. The changes have contributed to a further easing in financial conditions and helped ensure that the banking system is able to provide the credit that is needed for the recovery. Short-term interest rates have declined further to historical lows; together with the reduced interest rate on the Term Funding Facility, this has lowered bank funding costs and flowed through to even lower borrowing rates for households and businesses, and thus stronger cash flows. With 3 months' experience, the bond purchase program is working as intended, and government bond markets continue to function well. While the brighter global outlook has lifted long-dated bond yields globally, Australian long-term government bond yields are about 30 basis points lower because of the program than they otherwise would have been. The exchange rate is also lower than it otherwise would have been.", "Accommodative financial conditions have supported balance sheets and lifted asset prices, including housing prices. New lending to owner-occupiers has picked up noticeably in recent months, and growth in housing credit to owner-occupiers has also increased. Growth in investor credit and business credit is weak. Firms have been raising additional funds in debt and equity markets, and some firms have benefited from higher cash flows and retained earnings.", "At its February meeting, the Reserve Bank Board decided to maintain the targets of 10 basis points for the cash rate and the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds, as well as the parameters of the Term Funding Facility. The Board remains committed to do what it can to support the economy through the recovery, by maintaining highly supportive monetary conditions until its goals are achieved, which is still some way off. In light of the outlook and the international context, the Board decided to purchase an additional $100 billion of bonds issued by the Australian Government and states and territories when the current bond purchase program is completed in mid April. These additional purchases will be at the current rate of $5 billion a week.", "The Board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently. This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board does not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest."]}}]
