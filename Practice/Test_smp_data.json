    {"Date": ["Statement on Monetary Policy – May 2021"], "Section": ["5. Economic Outlook"], "Text": ["The global economic outlook has firmed this year because of progress in vaccinations and additional fiscal support in some economies. Overall growth in the global economy and in Australia's major trading partners is expected to rebound solidly this year and next (see ‘<a href=\"/publications/smp/2021/may/the-international-environment.html\">The International Environment</a>’ chapter).", "Even so, the recovery is expected to be incomplete over the forecast period in many economies, with China and the United States notable exceptions. The near-term outlook has also become more varied across economies recently as vaccination rates and policy support remain uneven and, in some cases, countries are facing another wave of infections. Underlying inflationary pressures are likely to remain contained in most economies for some time given spare capacity in labour markets, though the rebound in commodity and input prices will support inflation at least in the near term.", "The Australian economy is transitioning from recovery to expansion phase earlier and with more momentum than anticipated. The unique features of the pandemic and policy response have seen the economy rebound much faster than in previous downturns. Along with favourable health outcomes and the removal of restrictions on activity, this snap-back in activity has been supported by extraordinary fiscal and monetary support. GDP growth in the December quarter 2020 was stronger than expected and the recovery in activity and the labour market again exceeded expectations in the March quarter. GDP is now expected to have reached its pre-pandemic level in the March quarter 2021 and there were more people employed in March than before the pandemic. The unemployment rate has declined quickly, to 5.6 per cent in March, a little above the rate before the pandemic.", "In response to this stronger starting point for the forecasts and improved outlook further out, the baseline scenario for GDP and employment has been upgraded relative to the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. Under the baseline scenario, GDP is expected to grow by around 4¾ per cent over 2021 and 3½ per cent over 2022. The level of GDP is still expected to remain a little below that forecast before the pandemic, mostly due to lower population growth; in per capita terms, GDP is expected to be on a higher trajectory, supported by higher per capita household income and a strong contribution from public demand. The unemployment rate is expected to continue declining, to around 5 per cent by the end of 2021 and 4½ per cent by the end of the forecast period in mid 2023. The lower forecast unemployment rate results in wages growth and underlying inflation picking up a bit faster than previously anticipated. Inflation is expected to be close to 2 per cent by mid 2023 in the baseline scenario.", "The baseline scenario is based on the assumption that the domestic vaccine rollout accelerates in the second half of the year, allowing the international border to be reopened gradually from early 2022. This scenario assumes that no further large outbreaks and accompanying extended hard lockdowns occur within Australia, and that restrictions, when imposed, are brief.", "Overall, Australian households and businesses appear to be adjusting well to the tapering of fiscal and other temporary support measures. But the nature and speed of the next phase of growth is still characterised by uncertainty, particularly around household consumption and the extent of spare capacity given the disruptions to the supply side of the economy induced by the pandemic. The outlook is also likely to be uneven across industries for some time yet, reflecting the closed international border, restrictions in parts of the services sector, large shifts in consumer preferences, ongoing supply disruptions and slower population growth.", "Given this uncertainty, 2 alternative domestic scenarios (an upside and downside) are considered, based largely on different assumptions for household consumption:", "The level of GDP is expected to be around 2 per cent higher by mid 2023 than expected at the time of the February 2021 <cite>Statement</cite> (Graph 5.1; Table 5.1). The starting point for the forecasts is stronger than previously expected, following recent outcomes both for output and the labour market, and growth momentum in coming quarters is also a little stronger.", "Growth in activity is expected to be broad-based in the period ahead, led by the household sector and public demand. A pick-up in business investment is also now underway and expected to continue, supported by strong balance sheets, rising business confidence, and a steady decline in both spare capacity and general uncertainty.", "The outlook for the labour market has improved further. The starting point for the forecasts is noticeably better than anticipated at the time of the February <cite>Statement</cite>. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand have strengthened further, suggesting momentum in employment growth is likely to be sustained in the near term. It is also likely that there will be fewer job losses arising from the end of the JobKeeper program than previously expected. Beyond the near term, the stronger profile for activity underpins the upward revision to employment. The unemployment rate is expected to continue to decline over the forecast period, to around 4½ per cent by mid 2023. Consistent with this, wages growth and inflation are expected to pick up a little faster compared with the previous <cite>Statement</cite>. By the end of the forecast period in mid 2023, wages growth is expected to be around 2¼ per cent, with inflation just below 2 per cent.", "Conditions in the labour market have continued to improve more quickly than anticipated; employment and total hours worked in March were higher than before the pandemic, and the decline in the unemployment rate to 5.6 per cent in March (averaging 5.9 per cent in the quarter) has occurred considerably faster than was anticipated at the time of the February <cite>Statement</cite>.", "Employment growth is expected to remain strong over the next few months given solid momentum in activity, buoyant forward indicators of labour demand and other available information suggesting a muted effect from the end of the JobKeeper program in March (Graph 5.2). From late 2021, employment growth is expected to moderate in line with activity.", "Continued employment growth should drive further declines in the unemployment rate, which is now expected to move down to around 5 per cent by the end of 2021 (Graph 5.3). Additional but more moderate declines are expected over the rest of the forecast period, with the unemployment rate falling to around 4½ per cent by mid 2023. Other measures of labour market spare capacity, such as underemployment, have returned to around pre-pandemic levels, though before the pandemic underemployment was at quite high levels.", "The forecasts imply labour force participation will increase a little further over the year ahead and remain elevated for the rest of the forecast period. Strong labour demand should encourage workers to join and/or remain in the labour force, and structural drivers (such as increases in the pension eligibility age and more flexible working arrangements) should also continue to support an increase in participation.", "Strong household spending is expected to underpin GDP growth across the forecast period, supported by the further lifting of activity restrictions, a stronger outlook for household disposable income, wealth effects from higher housing prices, and reduced uncertainty (Graph 5.4). Timely indicators suggest that consumption growth moderated in the March quarter from 4¼ per cent in the December quarter, partly as a result of the short sharp lockdowns in a number of states. Consumption is expected to have been around 1½ per cent below its pre-pandemic level at the end of March. As economic outcomes continue to improve and more consumption possibilities become available, households are likely to rebalance more of their spending back towards services.", "The outlook for household disposable income growth is supported by stronger employment translating into higher labour income. It is also assumed that tax policy is unchanged, so that growth in household tax paid remains at or below the pace recorded in the years leading up to the pandemic. Higher housing prices lead to higher household wealth, which is expected to flow through to stronger consumption over several years. Both income and wealth effects boost consumption per capita, and together their effects largely offset the effect of slower population growth on aggregate consumption.", "The household saving ratio is expected to decline from around 12 per cent in the December quarter 2020 to 8 per cent by end 2021. Further out, the saving ratio is expected to return to around its average level over the 5 years prior to the pandemic. As uncertainty associated with the pandemic fades and restrictions ease, households are expected to avail of opportunities to spend. Households are assumed to treat the additional savings they accumulated through the pandemic (much of which was the result of limited spending opportunities) as an increase in wealth and as such consume only a small share of these savings over the forecast period. A more aggressive drawdown of accumulated savings is possible, and is considered in the upside scenario discussed below.", "Over 2020, containment measures did not have a material impact on residential construction activity; instead, government grants, lower interest rates and JobKeeper payments supported both activity and profitability in the sector. Dwelling investment returned to its pre-pandemic level in the December quarter, around 2 quarters earlier than previously expected, proving to be one of the more resilient parts of the economy through the pandemic. Residential construction activity is expected to grow steadily over 2021, as the large volume of development applications approved under the Australian Government's HomeBuilder scheme and similar state-based grants are worked through. The recent announcement of the extended deadline for the commencement of HomeBuilder projects means that some of this activity will be spread out over a longer period than previously assumed.", "While a large share of construction related to the HomeBuilder scheme is expected to represent a pull-forward in activity, low interest rates and the strong rebound in housing prices are expected to sustain growth in dwelling investment across most of the forecast period. Investment in higher-density residential construction is expected to remain subdued over the next year or so; this is due to low levels of building approvals over most of the past 3 years and lower investor appetite for these types of properties than seen over recent housing cycles. A gradual recovery in population growth should support a decline in rental vacancy rates in larger capital cities and a pick-up in higher-density investment towards the end of the forecast period.", "Non-mining business investment is expected to increase steadily over the forecast period. Following a 10 per cent decline after the onset of the pandemic, it is expected to return to its pre-pandemic level by early 2022 and expand thereafter. Investment began recovering in the December quarter, which was sooner than expected, and stronger reported business confidence and investment intentions support the more favourable outlook being sustained. This follows a period where the ratio of non-mining investment to output has been low relative to history.", "In the near term, the upward revision to non-mining investment is mainly accounted for by higher machinery &amp; equipment investment, which continues to respond to tax incentives, as well as improved business conditions and declining spare capacity, particularly in goods-related industries. With a stronger domestic recovery and firms' improved balance sheet position, machinery &amp; equipment investment is expected to be higher throughout the forecast period than in the February <cite>Statement</cite>. The profile for non-residential construction investment is also higher throughout, though it recovers at a more gradual pace than machinery &amp; equipment investment due to the lags in the approval and planning of construction projects. For this higher profile to be realised, a sustained pickup in building approvals will be needed over this year.", "The forecast profile for mining investment has been revised up a little. Profitability in the sector is picking up strongly in response to the recovery in commodity prices, and higher oil prices have improved the viability of some LNG projects. But despite buoyant commodity prices there have been few indications to date that major miners plan to expand iron ore-related investment in response to higher prices.", "Public demand is expected to contribute to GDP growth across the forecast period. The large public investment programs announced over 2020 are expected to remain an important contributor to growth. National accounts data for the December quarter showed a modest increase in public investment, which could suggest that spending is occurring a little more slowly than projected in state and Australian Government budgets. In line with this, the forecast for near-term growth in public investment has been lowered a little; however, it is assumed that public investment will pick up quickly in subsequent quarters. Further delays in obtaining equipment and/or progressing approvals, along with constraints on labour availability, pose downside risks to the public investment forecasts.", "The profile for public consumption has been upgraded to incorporate some expected additional spending related to the vaccination program. Other pandemic-related spending is expected to decline across the forecast period, but is offset by expected public consumption commitments stemming from longer-term factors such as the ageing population. The release of the Australian Government Budget on 11 May will contain further information relevant to the outlook for public demand.", "The outlook for exports has been upgraded a little, driven by higher rural and resource exports. Rural production benefitted from favourable weather conditions last year and some of this strength is expected to persist as the larger winter crop harvest continues to be exported. Coal exports have been revised higher as firms have been able to find alternative buyers more quickly than anticipated following the significant decline in sales to China. Education exports are forecast to grow a little slower over 2022 than previously expected because of ongoing uncertainty around international travel restrictions. An earlier return of travel to New Zealand has been factored in, reflecting the travel bubble established in April.", "The forecasts for import growth have been revised up because of stronger domestic demand, including business investment, and the recent appreciation of the exchange rate. This outweighs the effects of household consumption shifting back towards services, which are less import intensive. There remains a downside risk to trade in services if the wider reopening of international borders is delayed. While the effect of reduced tourism activity on GDP would likely be offset to some extent by Australians spending more at home, lower education exports would also drag on GDP.", "The terms of trade have been revised higher throughout, boosted by higher profiles for rural, iron ore, LNG and base metal prices (Graph 5.5). If commodity prices remain around current levels, the terms of trade in the June quarter 2021 will be near their previous peak in 2011, which was around the height of the mining investment boom. As in the February <cite>Statement</cite>, iron ore prices are expected to decline from near record levels over the forecast period, contributing to a fall back in the terms of trade.", "The faster improvement in the labour market is expected to result in labour market spare capacity being absorbed a little more quickly than previously expected. This should put some upward pressure on wages growth over time. After historically low year-ended wages growth of below 1½ per cent in the second half of 2020, growth in the Wage Price Index (WPI) is expected to pick up to a little under 2 per cent over 2021, before gradually increasing to around 2¼ per cent by mid 2023 (Graph 5.6).", "The upward revisions to the outlook for wages are predominantly for private sector wages; the outlook for public sector wages is little changed. Many of the private sector firms that had implemented temporary wage cuts last year reversed them in the December quarter (a little sooner than previously expected). Liaison indicates that many of the firms that currently have wage freezes in place plan to unwind them in coming months, while fewer firms plan to implement new ones. Public sector wages growth is expected to pick up over this year as some earlier wage freezes unwind, but then settle at a lower rate than in recent years reflecting various governments' wage cap policies.", "The GDP and labour market forecasts represent a stronger outlook than presented in the February <cite>Statement,</cite> and this is reflected in the forecasts for inflation. Even so, underlying inflation is still expected to increase only gradually over the next few years, to be close to 2 per cent in mid 2023 (Graph 5.7). However, the extent of estimated spare capacity in the economy is uncertain, which means it is plausible that wages growth and inflation could be slower or faster than currently envisaged in the baseline.", "Headline inflation is expected to spike to above 3 per cent over the year to the June quarter 2021, largely because the initial declines in prices from pandemic-related policies (such as free child care and preschool) drop out of the year-ended calculation. This temporary spike has been revised up a little, given automotive fuel prices have risen further recently. Headline inflation is expected to be slightly below trimmed mean inflation over most of the latter half of the forecast period; the recent extension to commencement deadlines for the HomeBuilder program will result in government grants being paid out more gradually than previously expected, subtracting a little from headline CPI each quarter until late 2022.", "Inflation outcomes are expected to vary considerably across components. Prices for some consumer durables, for example motor vehicles, are expected to increase further in the near term due to ongoing supply disruptions and strong demand, though business liaison information suggests that these effects are less acute than they were over 2020. Prices for newly built dwellings are likely to be a little stronger than previously expected, driven by strong demand for detached housing; however, the treatment of HomeBuilder and similar state-based grants will provide some offset in terms of measured new dwelling price inflation in the CPI. The forecasts reflect the disinflationary effects of weaker demand for some services, government subsidies and rebates, administered price freezes and the end of the annual 12.5 per cent tobacco excise increase. Utilities prices are expected to continue to fall for some time, because of recently announced reductions in regulated prices, low wholesale prices and increased electricity supply from renewables.", "A plausible upside scenario centres on stronger household consumption, where increases in housing and equity prices raise households' desire to consume by more than assumed in the baseline scenario. At the same time, the ongoing improvement in labour market conditions boosts labour income, out of which households consume, and increases households' willingness to draw down on savings that were accumulated during 2020.", "Stronger household consumption in the upside scenario leads the saving ratio to fall more sharply than in the baseline to around 2¾ per cent by mid 2023. Higher consumption and reduced uncertainty about the outlook also underpin faster growth in business investment and employment. This puts additional downward pressure on the unemployment rate. In this scenario, the stronger labour market leads to a faster pick-up in wages growth and inflation over the next couple of years. With the unemployment rate falling below 4 per cent, inflation rises to be back within the target range by mid 2023 (Table 5.2; Graph 5.8; Graph 5.9; Graph 5.10, Graph 5.11).", "A weaker trajectory than envisaged in the baseline scenario is possible if households increase their spending more gradually because they choose to save more of their income and/or use more of their accumulated savings for purposes other than consumption. The downside scenario assumes that some households respond to increases in their wealth due to higher asset prices by less than implied in the baseline, in part because they prefer to continue strengthening their balance sheets. High debt levels among some households might be one catalyst for this; a different trigger for prospective home owners could be rising housing prices and the related need to accumulate larger down payments.", "This scenario involves a more sluggish increase in activity than assumed in the baseline scenario. A slower pick-up in consumer spending sees the saving ratio remain high throughout the forecast period, edging down to around 8½ per cent by mid 2023. Lower consumption growth weighs on business income, prompting some firms to delay investment plans. Employment growth slows as these firms put off hiring decisions or lay off additional workers. In this scenario, the unemployment rate remains around 5¼–5½ per cent. The slower reduction in spare capacity in the labour market drags on wages growth, resulting in underlying inflation remaining below 2 per cent.", "The upside and downside scenarios considered above illustrate 2 plausible alternative paths for the economy based on different underlying assumptions around the ability and willingness of households to consume. Beyond this, other sources of uncertainty remain, although, as set out below, risks to the economic outlook have become more balanced.", "Global health outcomes are still highly uncertain. The uneven pace of vaccine rollout globally could stifle the global recovery, as could the emergence of virus strains that vaccines are less effective against. This would also affect when international travel restrictions can be lifted, and therefore the pace of recovery in domestic services trade and consumption. Scarring effects in certain industries and parts of the country could be more pronounced in such an environment. An extended closure of the international border would also depress domestic population growth and thus reduce demand and trend growth in the economy's productive capacity.", "The size, composition, timing and effectiveness of additional global and domestic fiscal measures is also a source of uncertainty, including for the investment outlook. One related domestic uncertainty is whether fiscal initiatives designed to spur the recovery in dwelling and business investment have mainly pulled forward demand or instead helped to set it on a new higher trajectory. It is possible that dwelling and business investment is stronger than currently anticipated even after targeted fiscal support measures expire, particularly if overall demand conditions remain strong and commodity prices remain at elevated levels. Furthermore, high commodity prices provide an additional source of government revenue and could support more fiscal stimulus than is currently assumed. Alternatively, public investment could be slower to roll-out than foreshadowed in the Australian Government and state budgets if capacity constraints start to bind.", "The outlook for housing and financial asset prices always entails a degree of uncertainty, and households' propensity to spend out of wealth becomes more salient in such an environment. If the expected growth in household wealth fails to materialise, consumption growth over the forecast period could follow a lower path; the reverse is true should household wealth increase by more than anticipated in the baseline scenario. Developments in the labour market and the general level of uncertainty experienced by households at that time would be additional contributors to weaker or stronger household consumption.", "The baseline scenario implies further reductions in spare capacity in the labour market (and the economy more generally) over the forecast period. However, it is uncertain how much spare capacity might remain, and how quickly its absorption might feed into upward pressure on wages and prices. Experience in the years prior to the pandemic suggests that the unemployment rate would need to be well below 5 per cent before wages growth and inflation might be expected to pick up quickly. Currently, both wage and price inflation are at a much lower level than over the past decade and, because of inertia in wage setting norms and inflation expectations, it may take some time for prices pressures to build even if spare capacity is absorbed more quickly than expected.", "Alternatively, unusual aspects of the current environment, including constraints in the supply side of the domestic and global economies, could mean that domestic wages growth and inflation pick up earlier and faster than expected. This could occur due to an extended period of supply-chain bottlenecks and firms' reduced ability to address labour shortages through interstate or international migration (see ‘<a href=\"/publications/smp/2021/may/box-c-international-border-closures-slower-population-growth-and-the-australian-economy.html\">Box C: International Border Closures, Slower Population Growth and the Australian Economy</a>’). More generally, the uneven nature of the recovery in supply and demand, along with the effects of various stimulatory policy measures, could see some unusually large movements in a subset of wages or prices in the period ahead. Depending on where these pockets of price pressure emerge and how long they last, it is possible that some households and businesses revise up their expectations for inflation.", "A stronger economic trajectory than the one envisaged in the baseline scenario is possible if households increase spending by more than expected. This could be in response to stronger wealth effects and a decline in uncertainty that boosts households' willingness to draw down on savings, which reinforces already improving conditions in the labour market and feeds back into faster income growth. Conditions supporting a faster pick-up in consumption would also support stronger private investment. In this scenario, the unemployment rate declines at a faster pace and to a lower level (around 3¾ per cent) than in the baseline scenario. This contributes to inflation picking up to around 2¼ per cent by the middle of 2023.", "A weaker trajectory could instead eventuate if households choose to consume their income and/or their prior savings at a slower pace than assumed in the baseline scenario. In this downside scenario, wealth effects on consumption are smaller, as households divert more of their financial resources to strengthening their balance sheets. Subdued consumption and private investment results in weaker labour income and the unemployment rate remaining above pre-pandemic levels in this scenario; this in turn sees underlying inflation remaining around 1½ per cent over the forecast period."], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2021/may/economic-outlook.html"},

    {"Date": ["Statement on Monetary Policy – November 2020"], "Section": ["5. Inflation"], "Text": ["Recent consumer price movements have been dominated by the impact of government policy responses to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> pandemic, as well as movements in world oil prices. Examples of policy-driven price changes include the temporary introduction of free child care nationwide, free preschool in some states and a number of price freezes for administered services. Further, there have been large declines in rents since March as border closures have contributed to an increase in rental vacancy rates and state governments have required landlords to negotiate rent reductions for tenants in financial difficulty. More broadly, social distancing restrictions have led to substantial changes in consumption patterns – most notably, a shift away from services expenditure in favour of spending on household goods and grocery food – and this has affected pricing decisions. The sharp decline in economic activity and increase in spare capacity has also contributed to subdued underlying inflation over the past two quarters.", "Responses to the pandemic have also affected wage movements. Many firms have responded to the effects of the pandemic by freezing wages, and in some cases by imposing temporary wage cuts for some, mostly senior, staff. Some planned wage increases have been deferred or reduced, including as a result of decisions by the Fair Work Commission (FWC) and some government employers. Some measures of wages growth, such as average earnings per hour (AENA), have been temporarily boosted by the JobKeeper wage subsidy as well as large compositional effects due to greater employment losses in lower paid jobs.", "The effects on prices and wages of many of these responses to the pandemic are expected to unwind over the coming year. However, elevated spare capacity in the economy means it is likely that wage and price inflation pressures will be subdued for a considerable period.", "Recent inflation outcomes have been unusually volatile as a result of the pandemic. The seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1.5 per cent in the September quarter as a number of large price increases reversed earlier declines that had stemmed from the pandemic and related policy responses (Graph 5.1; Table 5.1). The increase in September was the largest quarterly increase in CPI inflation (excluding interest charges) since 2006, and followed a decline in June that was the largest since 1931. Headline inflation was 0.7 per cent over the year to September.", "The main driver of the increase in the September quarter was prices for child care and some preschool services returning to more typical levels, after these had been fully subsidised by governments for much of the June quarter. Automotive fuel prices also rose, retracing some of the sharp decline earlier in 2020. Together, these price increases contributed 1¼ percentage points to CPI inflation in the quarter (Graph 5.2). Prices continued to rise for a number of retail items, including household goods and motor vehicles, reflecting ongoing strong demand. Housing-related prices (excluding utilities) rose a little in the September quarter, with further falls in rents more than offset by a rise in prices for newly built dwellings.", "The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has been able to return to normal price collection in most capital cities as social distancing restrictions have eased over recent months.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Imputed items comprised around 8 per cent of the basket in the quarter (compared with 12 per cent in the June quarter).", "Trimmed mean inflation increased to 0.4 per cent in the September quarter and was 1.2 per cent over the year (Graph 5.3). Part of this increase was because of the unusual pattern of component-level price movements, as several prices bounced back after sharp falls in the June quarter. In particular, price rises for child care and automotive fuel, as well as the imputed price increases for unavailable items, accounted for much of the increase in trimmed mean inflation in the quarter. Abstracting from these temporary shifts, underlying inflationary pressures in the economy remain subdued; CPI inflation excluding volatile items, child care, preschool and imputed items was around 0.2 per cent in the quarter.", "Administered price inflation increased sharply in the September quarter as several government subsidies implemented in response to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> pandemic ended. The Australian Government had fully subsidised child care and before- and after-school care services from 6 April to 12 July 2020, which meant prices fell to zero during this period. Prices returned to more normal levels in the September quarter in all cities except Melbourne, where child care centres remained closed for much of the quarter in accordance with public health restrictions. In addition, preschool fees returned to full price in Queensland after being waived for the second term of the school year. The end of these subsidies meant child care prices increased sharply in the quarter, and to a lesser extent preschool &amp; primary education prices. Together, the end of these policies contributed almost 1 percentage point to the increase in headline CPI in the September quarter. However, the price levels for these categories remain well below their pre-<span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> levels (Graph 5.4). Preschool fee waivers in New South Wales and Victoria have been extended until the end of the year – headline inflation will be boosted in early 2021 as these waivers are lifted.", "Fuel prices increased in the September quarter following a sharp fall over the first half of 2020 (Graph 5.5). The 9 per cent increase in the quarter contributed ¼ percentage point to quarterly headline inflation. Fuel prices declined slightly in the month of October. At current levels, automotive fuel prices are expected to have little impact on headline CPI in the December quarter.", "A number of other administered prices were reset in July. Property rates &amp; charges increased by less than is typical in the September quarter, largely because of price freezes in Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin and Hobart. This led to a seasonally adjusted price decline for these items (Graph 5.6). Other motor vehicle-related prices, which had declined earlier in the year due to the introduction of temporary free parking offers in some cities, increased a little in the September quarter. The CPI measure of urban transport fares declined further, reflecting the temporary introduction of discounted off-peak transport prices in Sydney.", "Prices for utilities, which account for around 5 per cent of the consumption basket, declined in the September quarter. In July, the Australian Energy Regulator's Default Market Offers – which are effectively caps on standing offer electricity prices in New South Wales, South Australia and southeast Queensland – were reduced, and the number of offers covered by the caps was expanded. These price reductions were partly offset by prices normalising in Brisbane, Canberra and Perth as one-off government rebates applied in the previous quarter expired. Gas prices declined, driven by a reduction in distribution charges in Sydney. Water &amp; sewerage prices declined due to changes in water authorities' pricing approaches in Adelaide and Sydney.", "Utilities inflation has been subdued for the past two years and is likely to remain low for some time. Wholesale gas prices have fallen in recent months alongside lower international prices. Lower wholesale gas prices and increased generation capacity from renewable energy projects continue to exert downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices (Graph 5.7). Additionally, retail utilities prices in Canberra, Darwin, Hobart and Perth are expected to remain broadly unchanged until 2021 due to state government price freezes.", "Retail prices, which comprise just over a quarter of the CPI, rose a little in the September quarter, to be 2.2 per cent higher over the year. Higher prices for consumer durable items accounted for much of this increase. The pick-up in consumer durables inflation was broad based, but was again especially marked for furniture &amp; household appliances, which have seen strong demand related to a large share of people spending more time at home (Graph 5.8). Global supply disruptions affecting stock levels have also tended to boost prices for consumer durables. Motor vehicle price inflation also picked up due to price pressures from reduced domestic inventory and the introduction of new models at higher price points. These increases were partly offset by price declines for clothing &amp; footwear, as demand for clothing has been weak and supply chain disruptions have affected clothing less than other consumer durables.", "Food prices fell in the September quarter, but were 3.3 per cent higher over the year (Graph 5.9). Liaison reports suggest that supermarket discounting behaviour has returned to pre-pandemic patterns, following a reduction in discounting during periods of heightened demand earlier in the year. Price declines were most notable for packaged foods and bread &amp; cereal products. In contrast, meat prices increased further as recent rainfall has induced some farmers to rebuild herds and flocks, reducing the supply of meat.", "Housing-related inflation rose slightly in the September quarter, after slowing sharply in the first half of 2020 mainly because of declines in rental prices. As a result, housing-related prices, which comprise around one-sixth of the CPI basket, contributed only a little to headline CPI in the quarter. Prices for newly constructed dwellings increased by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter. Strong price rises in Perth drove this increase as state government grants supported demand for dwellings in the September quarter and led builders to reduce bonus offers (Graph 5.10). In contrast, prices for new dwellings fell in all other capital cities except Melbourne and Canberra. Future price increases will depend on the outlook for dwelling construction and how quickly housing demand recovers following the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> shock.", "Rents were 1.4 per cent lower over the year to September, the largest year-ended decline in the 47 years since the quarterly series began (Graph 5.11). In part this is because of an increase in the stock of properties available for long-term rental, as some short-term holiday rental properties have been converted to long-term rentals following the introduction of travel restrictions. Declines in rental prices have also followed the introduction of state government policies that enable tenants to negotiate rent reductions if they are experiencing financial stress due to <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span>. Information from liaison contacts suggests that, nationally, up to 8 per cent of residential tenants have successfully negotiated rent reductions since the end of March, although some of these were only temporary and have already been reversed. Rent reductions for ongoing tenancies directly affect measured rent inflation because the CPI captures rents paid on the stock of existing rental properties. Public housing rent reductions and rent relief as part of land tax rebate schemes have also contributed to rent price falls in some states.", "Prices for market services were unchanged in the September quarter (Graph 5.12). These prices include household services such as hairdressing and house cleaning, as well as financial services and meals out &amp; takeaway, and comprise a little under a quarter of the CPI. The activity restrictions in Melbourne during much of the September quarter resulted in the ABS imputing prices for a number of items in that city. Elsewhere, the easing of restrictions allowed the ABS to return to normal price collection for most items, after imputed prices were used in the June quarter for a number of categories. This resulted in a measured increase in recreation, sport &amp; culture prices, as the return to normal price collection unwound the imputed June quarter price decline for the sports participation and other sporting &amp; cultural services expenditure classes. Offsetting this, strong competition between restaurants and takeaway food businesses led to lower prices for meals out &amp; takeaway.", "Wage- and price-setting behaviour can be affected by expectations about the future rate of inflation. Market economists' year-ahead inflation expectations have been revised down a little recently. In part this is because recent large anticipated changes in some price components (such as the effects of oil prices and government subsidies) are no longer influencing year-ahead expectations (Graph 5.13). In contrast, unions' short-term inflation expectations have picked up a little but remain relatively subdued. Long-term survey-based measures of inflation expectations are around 2–2½ per cent and remain consistent with the Bank's medium-term inflation target.", "Growth in the Wage Price Index (WPI) slowed to 0.2 per cent in the June quarter, to be 1.8 per cent higher in year-ended terms (Graph 5.14). These quarterly and year-ended growth rates were the slowest in the history of the series. Private sector wages growth slowed to 0.1 per cent in the quarter as employers made significant adjustments to wages in response to the effects of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span>. In contrast, public sector wages growth was stable at 0.6 per cent in the quarter.", "A small number of wage reductions weighed on growth in the June quarter. These were largest in professional, scientific &amp; technical services, other services and construction; liaison evidence suggests that these cuts were largely temporary. Although wage increases are typically less common in the June quarter than in other quarters, the ABS noted that wage increases in the June quarter 2020 were even less common than usual.", "In contrast to the very low growth in the WPI in June, average earnings per hour were 8.2 per cent higher in the quarter (Graph 5.15). This spike was driven by the effects of the JobKeeper program on this measure of earnings, as well as compositional changes in the labour market in the quarter.", "The spike in measured average earnings per hour is expected to be reversed over coming quarters as the JobKeeper program tapers and as employment in lower paid occupations continues to recover.", "The changes to the JobKeeper program effective from 28 September are likely to see business eligibility decrease and fewer employees benefit from the minimum payment. In addition, the minimum fortnightly payment was reduced from $1,500 to either $1,200, or $750 for workers who had worked fewer than 20 hours per week prior to the pandemic. The lower payment rates that apply over the December quarter would fully cover wages costs for around 10 per cent of employees if they are eligible (Graph 5.16). This coverage is lower than that provided by the initial JobKeeper program; the original – higher – payment was a larger amount than that earned by around one-fifth of employees prior to the effects of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> (for instance, including some part-time workers). Although the changes from late September will reduce the boost to average earnings received by employees, JobKeeper will continue to provide a substantial subsidy to labour costs until the program's scheduled expiry in March 2021.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 2\">[2]</a></sup>", "The FWC awarded a 1.75 per cent increase to award wages this year. This was lower than in recent years, and the increase was delayed for most affected employees from July to November or February. The deferred increase has also affected many employees covered by enterprise bargaining agreements given a growing number of these agreements have pay increases linked to the award wage outcome.", "Public sector wages growth was little changed in the June quarter, but wage freezes and deferrals will weigh on wages growth for the next few quarters. Some previously agreed wage increases have been deferred for up to 12 months, notably for Commonwealth and Queensland government employees. The NSW Industrial Relations Commission recently decided that pay rises in the current financial year for NSW government employees would be 0.3 per cent. The NSW Government has also announced plans to cap future wage increases to 1.5 per cent, lower than the 2.5 per cent increases applying in recent years.", "Evidence from the Bank's liaison program suggests that wage freezes have been a common response by firms to the impact of the pandemic on business conditions. In the September quarter, more than half of reporting firms in this program indicated they either had a wage freeze in place or expected to implement one in the year ahead (Graph 5.17). Many firms have delayed remuneration reviews, which will weigh on wages growth in the near term, but may provide some catch up if delayed increases subsequently occur. In addition, most reported wage cuts put in place earlier in the year remain in place, although most firms expect these to be temporary.", "The JobKeeper program increased employees' average hourly earnings above their ordinary payments in cases where employees would otherwise have earned less per fortnight than the minimum JobKeeper payment of $1,500.", "The overall composition of jobs worked also shifted significantly in the June quarter; responses to the pandemic resulted in relatively more job losses in lower paid jobs. This compositional change lifted the average level of hourly earnings in the quarter. (In contrast, compositional change did not affect the WPI, which measures ordinary time rates of pay for a sample of jobs that is held fixed from quarter to quarter.)"], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2020/nov/inflation.html"},

These policies, including wage subsidies and transfers to households, helped to support the cash flows of households and firms, and underpinned private sector demand. Indeed, household and business incomes in many advanced economies have fared much better during the first half of the year compared with previous recessions despite a larger contraction in GDP. This should support these economies in the next stage of the recovery, even as some forms of income support are scaled back in the period ahead.", "Household incomes have been supported by a range of measures through the government-mandated lockdowns and subsequent shock to private demand. Wage subsidies have been used extensively in advanced economies to protect jobs and support employee incomes.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Expanded social benefits were provided to people who lost their jobs or were unable to work. Some fiscal authorities made sizeable one-off cash transfers. Other measures, such as early access to superannuation in Australia, also supported household cash flows.", "In some economies, such as Australia, Canada and the United States, aggregate household disposable income rose strongly over the first half of the year as increased unemployment benefits and other transfer payments more than offset the decline in labour and other types of income (Graph A.1). In Australia, social assistance benefits in the June quarter were 50 per cent higher than the previous year. In Canada, government transfer payments to households doubled over the year to the June quarter. In the United States, transfers to households, including direct cash payments and increased unemployment benefits, doubled between March and April; in fact, the increase was so large that two-thirds of those unemployed earned more than in their previous employment.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> In contrast, social assistance benefits did not increase significantly in most European economies as they mainly relied on enhancing existing wage subsidy schemes.", "Wage subsidies have been critical to supporting household incomes and employment. Participation in wage subsidy schemes has been significant; in some economies, up to 60 per cent of the labour force have received these subsidies at some point. In Europe, while wage subsidies have supported household incomes by keeping workers attached to their employers, they have not prevented a decline in income. In Australia and New Zealand, wage subsidies have involved a minimum payment to workers and, in some cases, this exceeded the original earnings for some participants.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 3\">[3]</a></sup> Importantly, beyond directly supporting incomes, wage subsidy schemes have limited the initial increase in unemployment, reduced income uncertainty and supported household confidence. By helping to maintain relationships between employees and their employers, wage subsidy programs will also limit longer-term scarring effects in the labour market that can result from unemployment.", "The significant support to household incomes has enabled a shallower downturn and faster rebound in some forms of consumption, especially for goods, and has boosted household savings. Some of this increase in savings has been forced: activity restrictions prevented the purchase of many services.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"r4\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 4\">[4]</a></sup> The increases in incomes in the United States and Canada in the early stage of the pandemic were so large that it is unlikely households would have spent them immediately even if consumption opportunities were unconstrained. The boost to household savings should support consumption in the period ahead as some income support measures are scaled back.", "Government support for businesses has been important in directly offsetting large declines in revenue, thereby limiting job losses and business closures. In most advanced economies, this support has come principally in the form of wage subsidies, and to a lesser extent from other business subsidies and measures such as tax deferrals and loan guarantees (Graph A.2). Wage subsidies have supported business viability by sharply reducing the effective wage bill and thereby firms' operating costs.", "Other direct business subsidies have also been important in some economies. In Australia, the value of non-wage subsidies in the June quarter was equivalent to just under one-third of the total value of government assistance for businesses; in Canada, the comparable figure was around 15 per cent. In the United States, effectively one-quarter of government business subsidies were non-wage subsidies because the small businesses using the Paycheck Protection Program could use up to one-quarter of their loans for eligible non-wage expenses and still qualify for loan forgiveness.", "The increase in net government transfers to households and business subsidies to date have far exceeded the increases seen in past recessions (Graph A.3).", "Net transfers to households generally increase during a recession because less tax is collected and government payments increase as people lose their jobs (reflecting the effect of ‘automatic stabilisers’), but the unprecedented policy measures have boosted this effect. As a result, recent trends in private sector incomes have been atypical compared with other economic contractions.", "The unusually strong support to household incomes and business viability has contributed to a stronger and quicker recovery in a number of economies than was widely anticipated before lockdowns were lifted. The recovery has been especially rapid in sectors that have been less constrained by remaining social distancing requirements, such as goods consumption and production. Moreover, consumer and business confidence have also been supported, and business failures and personal defaults have been limited so far.", "The fragility of the recovery has led many governments to extend their wage subsidy schemes into 2021. At the same time, there has been an effort to make them more targeted (by narrowing the schemes' scope through tightened eligibility) and to reduce the value of the benefits paid. Some governments have also announced substantial further fiscal support, including for labour markets beyond the initial wage subsidies and investment initiatives to boost the recovery phase.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"r5\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 5\">[5]</a></sup>"], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2020/nov/box-a-income-support-policies-in-advanced-economies-during-the-covid-19-pandemic.html"}]
