{"Date": ["Sydney – 5 December 2006"], "Text": {"Present": [" GR Stevens (Chairman), RC Corbett AM, KR Henry, JR Broadbent AO, DG McGauchie AO, WJ McKibbin, HM Morgan AC ", " R Battellino, ML Edey ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 7 November 2006 were approved. "], "International Conditions": [" Discussion of international economic conditions commenced with an assessment of the growth of Australia's trading partners. Weighted by shares of Australia's exports, the GDP of Australia's trading partners had increased by 4.7 per cent over the past year, which was a modest slowing from 2005. Looking ahead, the main question analysts were focusing on was the extent to which the slowing in the US economy would affect the world economy as a whole. ", " In the US, the latest data suggested that growth had slowed further in recent months from the average 3½ per cent pace of recent years. The housing sector remained the key to near-term prospects for overall growth. Construction activity was currently forecast to fall by around 20 per cent, and could fall by more given that housing starts had now declined by 30 per cent since the peaks at the start of the year. The consensus view was that GDP growth would slow to around 2½ per cent, but recent data suggested some downside risk to this expectation. ", " House prices in the US appeared to have peaked and had been flat for much of 2006, according to the average of the available measures; median prices, which are affected by compositional change, had fallen, while a repeat-sales index, which excluded compositional shifts, was beginning to level out. An important consideration for policy-makers was how the wealth effects associated with slowing – or even falling – house prices would affect household spending. While retail sales had softened in recent months, aggregate measures of personal consumption had not slowed much so far during 2006, and had been underpinned by the strong labour market, which had supported healthy growth in incomes. Growth in other parts of the US economy had continued to be strong. Corporate profits had increased by 30 per cent over the year to the September quarter and represented a rising share of GDP, and business investment was robust. ", " The latest data on inflation in the US indicated that the headline rate had fallen to 1¼ per cent, reflecting the influence of falling oil prices, which has a particularly large effect on the US CPI as the small tax component in retail gasoline prices leads to proportionally larger changes in the latter as oil prices change. The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, had eased from just under 3 per cent to 2¾ per cent. This was regarded by the Fed as still uncomfortably high, and the likely future trend in this measure would be key for the conduct of US monetary policy. ", " Growth in Japanese GDP was solid in the September quarter, though not as high as earlier in the year. The expansion was continuing, with business investment growing strongly, consumer confidence high and the labour market healthy. Following revisions, the core CPI was running at about −½ per cent, which was making the Bank of Japan cautious in considering further monetary policy adjustments. ", " In China, growth in industrial production had eased to around 15 per cent, following a spike close to 20 per cent and generally higher rates of growth in the past year or two. Good growth in GDP had been recorded in most east Asian economies in the September quarter after a soft patch around the middle of the year. Over the past few years, China had become as important a destination for exports of east Asian economies as the US, but members noted that China would not be immune to the effects of the slowdown in the US. The share of Japanese exports to China had also risen in recent years, to be about the same as for Europe, though the US remained a more important export destination. ", " Economic growth in the euro area had continued to pick up gradually, with year-ended growth in GDP stable at around 2½ per cent in the September quarter. ", " India had recorded very strong growth over the past year or so, and GDP had increased by more than 9 per cent over the year to the September quarter. The size of the Indian economy was less than half that of China on a purchasing power parity basis, but together these two economies were steadily becoming more important parts of the world economy. ", " The crude oil price had moved above US$60 per barrel over the past month. This had been attributed to the effect of a cold snap in the US and the response by markets to production cuts proposed by OPEC. "], "Domestic Conditions": [" Members were informed that information received in the past few days had led to a revised estimate of GDP growth in the September quarter. The latest data for key partial indicators of expenditure and income suggested that quarterly output growth was now more likely to be around ½ per cent than the 1 per cent noted in the Board paper. ", " Retail sales increased solidly in October and year-ended growth had been steady at about 6 per cent since early 2006. Annual growth in sales by large retailers had been higher than that for small retailers for most of the year. ", " In the housing sector, building approvals for both houses and medium-density dwellings fell in October, though some correction from earlier increases had been likely. Approvals in individual States were volatile and disparate trends across the country were apparent. Vacancy rates for rental dwellings had declined further in recent months and, in most capital cities, were around the low levels reached in previous cycles. In all, recent housing-related data were consistent with construction activity having reached a trough, and a modest pick-up in activity in the year ahead was expected. ", " Nationwide house prices had increased in the September quarter, according to ABS data, which were somewhat stronger than those recently sourced from APM. House prices had risen in all capital cities except Sydney, where they remained relatively flat; prices continued to rise at an unsustainably fast pace in Perth, being 46 per cent higher over the year. ", " Turning to an assessment of domestic financial conditions, with a longer perspective it was apparent that the most recent pattern, i.e. where business credit was growing more rapidly than household credit, had been the norm during most of the 1980s. The string of corporate collapses following the boom in the late 1980s had prompted a decade and a half of conservative balance-sheet management as businesses had aimed to keep gearing low. This situation was now changing and the current period of businesses gearing up could run for a while. In recent months, household credit growth had begun to slow, and this could be seen in both the monthly credit growth and loan approvals figures, in the latter case particularly in approvals to investors, which were down from their peaks earlier in the year. ", " Business investment was estimated to have fallen in the September quarter, and in year-ended terms and on a national accounts basis, growth was likely to have fallen below 5 per cent. This had followed annual growth rates of 10–20 per cent since 2002. Expectations of investment spending in the year ahead indicated that spending was likely to be flat, at a high level. Business investment as a share of GDP had been trending up for the past five years. ", " Commodity prices had been stable recently, but the main feature was the extent of the rise over the past three years: measured in domestic and foreign currency terms, commodity prices had increased by 70–80 per cent since late 2003. Base metals prices had increased by around 50 per cent in the early part of 2006, and following a correction after the peak in May, appeared to have resumed an upward trend since the middle of the year. Rural commodity prices were displaying the effects of the drought, with both wheat and wool prices rising sharply over the past 12–18 months. This was similar to the experience during the 2002 drought. ", " The current account deficit was estimated to have fallen in the September quarter, driven by a decline in the trade deficit to around ½ per cent of GDP. However, the latest data were not seen as heralding a trend decline in the current account deficit, as monthly trade data suggested the deficit would widen again in the short term. ", " In the labour market, a correction to the run of very strong monthly employment growth came with a significant decline in estimated employment and labour force participation in October. Year-ended employment growth remained above 2 per cent, which was still high relative to the recent pace of GDP growth. Unemployment fell to 4.6 per cent. Business surveys indicated that labour market conditions were still tight, with small and medium businesses continuing to report that difficulty finding quality staff was a greater concern than a lack of work or sales. ", " The wage price index indicated that wages growth had fallen to 0.8 per cent in the September quarter and 3.8 per cent over the year. These figures, which were lower than the recent pace of wages growth of over 4 per cent, reflected the changed timing of the minimum wage increase this year. Adjusting for this, in underlying terms wages growth had remained stable at just over 4 per cent, having increased slowly from around 3 per cent over the past eight years. Broadly the same picture was evident from the data on wage increases from enterprise agreements. ", " The sharp fall in petrol prices in recent months was expected to subtract ¾ percentage point from the CPI in the December quarter. This implied that the headline CPI rise was likely to be close to zero in the quarter; the CPI data would be released by the ABS in late January. ", " The Board was briefed on the revised inflation outlook following the latest data on wages and taking account of the November interest rate increase. The underlying rate of inflation was now expected to increase a bit further in the short term on a year-ended basis, and then drift down towards 2¾ per cent over the next two years. Headline inflation was forecast to decline sharply over the next year and thereafter to rise to be the same as the underlying rate. "], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": [" Discussion of conditions in financial markets began with some assessment of the state of markets globally. ", " There were four main observations. First, the world remained in a low-interest rate environment, with policy interest rates in a majority of countries still below average. Australia was one of the few countries with its policy rate above the average prevailing since 1993, which was the start of the current low-inflation period. It was mainly the English-speaking countries that had rates above average. Secondly, the return on equity was high and the cost of debt low, and this was providing a major impetus to the re-gearing of the corporate sector globally, with the private equity boom being one symptom of this. Thirdly, perceived risks remained low, as indicated by default rates on debt, which were at historical lows, and lower volatility in financial markets. Taken together, these phenomena had produced a very benign environment for financial markets. ", " Turning to the regular update on current developments in financial markets, the main risk worrying markets at present was that the US economy would slow more than expected and that the slowing would spread to other countries. In recent months, markets had viewed this concern as greater than the risk of a resurgence of inflation. Markets thought it was likely that the Fed would cut the Fed funds rate in the first half of 2007, though the Fed had been trying to convey a message that such expectations were premature. ", " The 10-year bond yield in the US had fallen back to around 4.4 per cent in the past month, which was the same level prevailing a year earlier. Bond yields in Europe and Japan had also fallen; in Europe, the decline in bond yields had come despite expectations that the ECB would tighten monetary policy again at its next meeting. Recent movements in bond yields indicated that markets thought that the global interest rate cycle was reaching a peak. ", " The Chinese authorities had tightened monetary policy further, mainly by raising the required reserve ratio on banks. Interest rates had risen from the very low level prevailing in the second half of 2005, but were still below 3 per cent. Bank liquidity was high in China, reflecting the effect of foreign exchange intervention by the People's Bank of China. ", " The US share market rose early in November but declined later in the month following the release of softer than expected economic data. Overall, the market had been relatively strong, having risen by 12 per cent over the year to date. It was still 8 per cent below its peak in 2000. ", " Share prices had also been strong in other countries during 2006, noticeably so in Europe, where the rise had been 17 per cent over the year to date. The Japanese market had fallen slightly this year but the fall had followed a very strong rise in 2005. Share markets in emerging markets were ending 2006 in a strong position after a mid-year shake-out. These markets had risen by 20–25 per cent over 2006 to date, after even larger rises in 2005 as improving economic conditions had become apparent. ", " The US dollar had fallen significantly during November and early December. This had mainly been because of softer US economic data, though the fall had come against the background of concerns that Asian countries might diversify reserves holdings away from the US and towards Europe. The US dollar was close to the low point against the euro that was reached in late 2004. The fall against the yen had been more modest. On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar had fallen a little in the past month and by 7 per cent over 2006 to date, but was no lower than in late 2004. Taking a longer perspective, the broad trade-weighted index in real terms, i.e. taking account of differences in inflation in the US and its trading partners, was currently around its average level of the past 30 years, and at least 10 per cent above the lows reached in the early 1990s. The fall in the US dollar had resulted in the Chinese authorities allowing the renminbi to rise slightly faster against it than in the past. ", " In Australia, financial markets had fully anticipated the interest rate increase following the November meeting of the Board, and the announcement had little further effect. Short-term yields had not changed much since then, and current yields implied no expectation of a further tightening of monetary policy in the next few months. ", " Longer-term interest rates in Australia had fallen, as they had in most other countries, though the falls had not been as large as there was not the same concern as in the US that the economy was losing momentum. ", " The Australian share market had been a little more volatile during November than in the previous few months, but ended the month slightly higher. Resource shares had fallen in the month, reflecting concern about the possibility of a slowdown in the US and the wider implications that would flow from that, but other sectors of the share market had risen further. The market overall had risen by 15 per cent over the year to date, which was another strong outcome. After including dividends, the increase for the year to date was close to 20 per cent, the fourth consecutive year of strong returns. In fact, returns had been strong and stable for over a decade, with only one year of negative returns in the past 12 years. This had been underpinned by the solid and consistent growth of the economy and company profits. ", " Company analysts had continued to revise up their estimates for overall profit growth in the year ahead, though within the aggregate, estimates of profit growth of resource companies had been revised down. ", " Despite the recent further rises in share prices, the current P/E ratio continued to be in line with long-run averages and slightly below the average for the low-inflation period. Dividend yields had also been maintained around average levels. ", " The Australian dollar had risen further against the declining US dollar in the past month, and had returned to the top of the trading range of the past three years. Although the Australian dollar had fallen slightly against the euro, in trade-weighted terms the Australian dollar was higher over the past month. At its current level, the TWI was also around its highs of recent years and about 10 per cent above its long-run average. The current level of the TWI reflected the fact that the Australian dollar had increased significantly against Asian currencies over the past 20 years; it had depreciated a little against other major currencies over that period. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The Board noted that the November increase had been relatively well accepted by financial markets and the community. The recommendation to the Board was for no change in the cash rate in December. ", " The data on economic activity in the US had been a little weaker over the past month, though at this stage the outlook for the world economy was still for growth to continue at an above-average rate in 2007. The latest data on economic conditions in Australia had been mixed, with the most recent run of data on activity and incomes being quite moderate and further signs of easing in the demand for finance on the part of households. ", " The updated staff forecast for underlying inflation, taking into account the November tightening, was for it to remain around 3 per cent in the near term, then to decline gradually, to 2¾ per cent over the ensuing year or two. Board members also noted some risk that inflation could remain stubbornly high. Despite the well-behaved nature of the latest data on wages growth, members noted an apparent slowing of productivity growth. On the other hand, risks of inflation expectations rising would be lowered by the sharp fall in headline inflation in prospect over the year ahead. ", " Overall, the Board judged that with the existing stance of policy mildly restrictive, there was time to assess trends in the world and domestic economies over the summer before considering further action. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.25 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 3 October 2006"], "Text": {"Present": [" GR Stevens (Chairman), KR Henry, JR Broadbent AO, DG McGauchie AO, WJ McKibbin, HM Morgan AC. Members granted leave of absence to RC Corbett AM in terms of section 18A of the <cite>Reserve Bank Act 1959</cite>. ", " R Battellino, ML Edey ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 5 September 2006 were approved. "], "Economic Conditions": [" The news on the domestic economy in the past month had centred on the release of the national accounts for the June quarter. This had been a puzzling set of figures, particularly when set against recent indicators of strength such as labour market conditions. On the international front, recent data were suggesting that overall growth next year would be lower than the very strong 2006 outcome, but still higher than average, even with a slowdown in the US economy. "], "International Conditions": [" In the United States, employment growth in the past few months had eased to a rate slightly below trend. The unemployment rate had levelled out at just over 4½ per cent. Developments in the labour market had typically been a good gauge of the business cycle, suggesting that the economy was experiencing a slowing at present. In view of the rising inflationary pressures in recent months, some slowing was a healthy development; the main question was about its extent. For the moment, the best assessment was that growth was easing to a pace just below trend. However, with inflation still relatively high, the period ahead would be uncomfortable for the Federal Reserve. While the headline inflation rate was set to fall from around 4 per cent in the months ahead following the recent sharp fall in oil prices, the core measure, which excluded food and energy prices, had trended up in recent months. This measure was currently around 3 per cent on an annualised basis and recent monthly rates had not shown any signs of slowing. ", " Members were conscious that as the unwinding of the housing boom in the US could have unpredictable consequences, including significant adverse effects on household spending, the high-frequency data needed to be monitored carefully in the period ahead. In August, housing permits and starts were around 20 per cent below the peak six months earlier, but the extent of any further decline was likely to be a function of how much overbuilding had occurred in the upswing over the previous several years. Consumer spending was also being dampened by the declining or levelling out of house prices at present, but fears of a ‘hard landing’ being driven by the housing sector were regarded as exaggerated at this stage. Economy-wide indicators suggested that the softening in conditions was not as sharp as for the housing sector. ", " In Japan, the Tankan survey, conducted by the Bank of Japan, indicated that business conditions were trending up to levels comparable to those prevailing prior to the recessionary period. In the corporate sector, profits, which had been rising since the mid to late 1990s, had been used to retire debt; in the past few months lending to businesses had been growing for the first time in well over a decade. ", " Growth in industrial production in China remained high, suggesting no change to the outlook for ongoing strong growth in output. There continued to be some doubts over the quality of the Chinese economic data. With anecdotal evidence of rising costs in the coastal cities owing to rapid demand growth, prices for Chinese exports would need careful watching. ", " Another fast-growing part of the world economy was India, where output growth was 9 per cent over the year to mid 2006. In the past few years growth had stepped up from 6 per cent to around 8–9 per cent. ", " Both China and India had significantly increased their shares of the world economy and world trade over the past decade. In particular, with average growth in GDP of 9 per cent over the 10 years to 2005, China's share of the world economy had reached over 15 per cent on a PPP basis. In the case of India, average growth of 6 per cent per annum had seen its share of the world economy reach 6 per cent in 2005. Population trends were likely to boost the relative importance of India in the global economy for some time. India's population growth rate was more than double that of China, and by 2030 India would overtake China in terms of population according to official projections. Accompanying these broader trends had been a marked increase in both countries' share of Australia's exports. Members expressed interest in seeing trade figures by sector for these countries, which were of growing importance to Australia. ", " The euro area was experiencing better economic conditions than in recent years. Industrial production and measures of consumer and business sentiment had all trended up over the past year or so. ", " For the world economy as a whole, growth was set to slow from about 5 per cent in 2006 to 4½ per cent in 2007, according to Consensus forecasts, but this would still be above average. However, members noted that if the US economy slowed more noticeably than currently expected, this could well spread through the world economy more broadly. ", " Crude oil prices had fallen in the previous few weeks, to close to US$60 per barrel, as tensions in the Middle East had eased further. There had been signs of demand softening together with some positive news on oil discoveries. It was also likely that market dynamics had acted to correct part of the overshoot in prices around the middle of the year. Futures prices for oil were flat around the current spot price. If sustained, the latest developments in oil prices would reduce the December quarter CPI in Australia by around ½ of a percentage point. "], "Domestic Conditions": [" The focus of discussion on domestic economic conditions was initially on how to reconcile the lower-than-expected GDP growth rate reported for the June quarter and the year to June with other indicators that had shown rising growth rates in the first half of 2006. Although the national accounts for the most recent few quarters were estimates and could be subject to significant revision, the data had posed a number of puzzles. It was noteworthy that all three measures of GDP had indicated a slowing in growth to around 2 per cent for the year to the June quarter. ", " In looking at sources of growth in the June quarter and over the past year, members noted that consumption growth had been moderate, dwelling investment appeared to be levelling out and business investment had continued to grow strongly. With public demand growing above trend, this implied that growth in domestic final demand had continued to be robust. GDP growth was relatively low because demand growth had been met by a decline in inventories and ongoing rapid growth in imports. The inventories data were of low quality and prone to substantial revision, so there was likely to be some reversal of the drag from growth from that source in the near term. ", " In contrast to the data on output growth, conditions in the labour market had remained strong during the first half of the year, with strong employment growth and a further slight decline in the unemployment rate. The contrast between GDP and employment trends had persisted for the past 2½ years. Employment had increased at an above-trend pace since the end of 2003 but during that period GDP growth had been lower than the average for the current expansion. Other data on the labour market, e.g. for vacancies, were consistent with the strength in employment, so while some element of overstatement was possible in employment growth or hours worked, it was not likely to be significant. The implied sharp slowdown in productivity growth appeared implausible. Despite a number of possible explanations being canvassed, members felt that the conundrum of relatively slow output growth and high employment growth remained. They noted that growth in nominal GDP had been very rapid, owing in part to the rising terms of trade, and this had supported buoyant growth in government revenues. However, it was acknowledged that the measurement errors involved in converting nominal to real magnitudes in measuring GDP growth could be greater than usual at present, given the large changes in relative prices taking place. ", " Turning to indicators of economic activity in the September quarter, the NAB survey of non-farm businesses suggested that business conditions had remained high after the middle of the year. ", " In the household sector, conditions appeared likely to support continued moderate growth in spending. Falling fuel prices had been a factor favouring further growth, along with tax cuts and growth in wages and employment, though these had been partly offset by the effect of the recent increases in interest rates. Taking all these factors into account, real household disposable income was rising at around 3 per cent, while nominal retail spending appeared to be rising at around 6 per cent per annum. Consumer sentiment, one of the few indicators post-dating the August rate rise, in September had recovered about two-thirds of the sharp fall in August and was now around the long-run average level. Households spent 11 per cent of disposable income on debt servicing in the June quarter. The rising share of households which had an exposure to the investment property market over time had contributed a substantial proportion of the rise in total debt-servicing. ", " The housing construction sector was close to a trough. With approvals and commencements running below trend, this implied that the growing backlog would support growth in construction activity. Moreover, vacancy rates, which were at relatively low levels, had fallen further in recent quarters. Across the country, there had been a large cumulative downturn in New South Wales but thus far no downturn in Western Australia, which was the part of the country benefiting most from the resources boom. In the period ahead, it was likely that aggregate housing activity would shift from being a negative to a mildly positive influence on growth. ", " Conditions in the secondary housing market had been firm, though there were some signs of softness in the most recent data. House prices had appeared to increase up to around the middle of the year, but since then there had been some tentative evidence of a stabilisation. The rapid growth in house prices in Perth over the past several years was quite different from that seen in the other capitals, where prices had been flat between the end of 2003 and the end of 2005 and risen mildly since then. Auction clearance rates were a little lower in August, both in Sydney and Melbourne. ", " Household credit growth had increased around the middle of the year, but since then had eased back to around 1 per cent per month. Finance approvals had been lower in the past two months, which suggested that the more moderate credit growth would continue in the near term. ", " Business investment rose in the June quarter but year-ended growth eased to around 11 per cent. Further slowing in growth was likely, but the high level of investment in the economy nonetheless implied a significant contribution to the growth in productive capacity. Business credit growth had been rising, to about 16 per cent per annum. ", " Turning to the exports sector, receipts had been trending up. This had mostly reflected rising export prices but export volumes had increased by 1½ per cent in the June quarter. Further growth in export volumes was expected in the year or two ahead given the extent of new capacity put in place in the past few years. However, the outlook for rural exports was poor given continued dry conditions across most of the country. ", " Commodity prices had remained high in recent months. Base metals prices, which appeared to have peaked in May, had been broadly stable over recent months at a level around 50 per cent higher than at the start of the year. ", " The Board was briefed on the revised forecasts for output growth and inflation that had been prepared for the meeting. The outlook for underlying inflation was for it to remain close to its recent level of around 3 per cent. This would be reviewed following the prices data to become available during October. "], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": [" There had been no changes to official interest rates in the major countries in September. Current policy rates in these countries were 5.25 per cent in the US, 3.0 per cent in the euro area and 0.25 per cent in Japan. Commentary from the Federal Reserve suggested that there may be a need for further rises in official interest rates to contain inflationary pressure, though the markets were of the view that interest rates had peaked. ", " During the month, longer-term market interest rates fell noticeably in most countries. Much of this was sourced to the US, where markets considered that the weakness in the housing sector could translate to a general slowing of the economy. Lower yields were supported by falling oil prices, which held out the prospect of lower inflation. Yields on 10-year bonds in the US fell to 4.6 per cent, 60 basis points lower than three months earlier. A fall of this magnitude was not unprecedented, but the fact that bond yields were now lower than the fed funds rate was significant. On previous occasions when this had occurred in the past decade, it had been a precursor to policy easing by the Fed. It was not clear that this was the right interpretation on this occasion as a number of structural factors, in particular strong capital flows from Asia, were still pushing bond yields down. ", " Bond yields in other markets did not fall by as much as in the US. In both Europe and Japan, bond yields remained well above the respective official interest rates. ", " The US share market was relatively strong in September, rising by a further 2 per cent, and prices had exceeded the peak in May. Expectations that lower oil prices would reduce inflationary pressures were an important factor behind the market's strength, but lower bond yields may also have been supporting higher share valuations. ", " Exchange rates had continued to be stable during September. The US dollar was little changed on a trade-weighted basis in the month, and had shown little net change over the past two years. The main development in foreign exchange markets in recent months had been the weakening of the yen, despite the improving prospects for the Japanese economy. Whereas in most countries a stronger economy was associated with a rising exchange rate, growing confidence of Japanese financial institutions had been encouraging them to take on more risk and increase their investment offshore, pushing the yen down. These capital outflows by institutions have been accompanied by higher investment offshore by Japanese households, seeking the relatively higher yields abroad. ", " In China, the rate of appreciation of the renminbi exchange rate had increased. It had taken almost a year to appreciate from 8.1 to the US dollar to 8.0, but in only three months the renminbi had moved from 8.0 to 7.9. ", " In the past month, emerging markets were subject to several potentially unsettling events, but none seemed to have had a significant impact. An example was the military coup in Thailand, which could have been negative for financial markets. As it turned out, the exchange rate, share market and bond spreads were not much affected. Similarly, some political instability in emerging European countries and Latin America did not affect bond spreads in these markets. ", " In Australia, there had been little change in short-term interest rates during the past month, though six-month money market yields declined slightly. Expectations of further tightening of monetary policy declined to only a 30 per cent chance by the end of the year. ", " Long-term interest rates in Australia had fallen, to around 5.6 per cent, though not to the same extent as in the US. The yield curve was inverse, i.e. with long-term yields below the cash rate. Unlike in the US, this had been the case for much of the past 18 months, and it was difficult to extract from it much of significance for policy. ", " The Australian share market had been relatively flat in September, reflecting some weakening in the prices of resource stocks, and as a result had underperformed the major markets overseas. A similar development had occurred in countries where resource stocks carried a high weighting in the share market, e.g. Canada. Prices of resource stocks were still noticeably below the peak in May, whereas prices of financial and industrial company stocks had mostly recovered the May peaks. ", " The corporate profit reporting season had largely ended. Overall, underlying profits of ASX200 companies were 35 per cent higher than in the June 2005 half-year. Much of the growth in profits had come from resource companies, whose profits increased by 72 per cent, but profit increases had been broadly based: 70 per cent of the top 200 listed companies had reported higher profits. Financial stocks had reported a 19 per cent rise in profits, while other industrial companies had reported a modest increase. Analysts have reduced their estimates of profit increases for the current and next financial years, mainly because of revised expectations for profit growth of resource companies. This represented a change in the recent trend, which had been for profits to be progressively revised up. ", " The Australian dollar had fallen slightly both against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms, but remained well within its recent range. The Australian dollar had been more stable recently than either the Canadian or New Zealand dollars. The latter had risen quite sharply in the past few months but remained below the level reached late in 2005. ", " Board members were informed about some recent developments in hedge funds. In particular, the losses by Amaranth Advisors, which, at US$6 billion, were the largest since the collapse of LTCM in 1998, had caused remarkably little repercussion on financial markets, apart from gas futures. The lack of any wider contagion from these large losses was attributed to the overall size of the market and the dispersion of risks. Some facts about the Australian hedge fund industry were also outlined. Despite being the largest in Asia, the local industry was still small in absolute terms. Members noted that, under Australian arrangements, hedge funds were subject to the same regulations as any other fund manager, a better arrangement than in the US, where a lesser degree of disclosure applied to hedge funds. Members also noted that the credit exposures of local banks to hedge funds were relatively low, and were monitored by APRA. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change in the cash rate in October. ", " The Board noted that over the past month there had been further evidence that the composition of economic growth across countries was shifting, but that overall growth, while likely to slow somewhat in 2007, would still be solid. Growth in the domestic economy in the first half of the year had been disappointing, though it had been difficult to reconcile the estimate of low growth in GDP with robust growth in employment and indications of a tight labour market. There had still been only limited data that post-dated the increase in the cash rate in August. ", " Members felt that it was very important to resist the current period of relatively high inflation and to ensure that inflation expectations were contained. With the staff forecast of inflation of around 3 per cent remaining uncomfortably high, the Board considered whether there was a case to tighten monetary policy again this month. However, given the preceding discussion on current economic conditions in the world economy and Australia, and allowing that the degree of slowing in growth shown by the national accounts potentially contained some genuine infonnation, the Board judged that the case to tighten further was no stronger than it had been in the previous month. ", " Noting that several key data releases were scheduled for the month ahead, importantly including the September quarter CPI, the Board judged that a clearer assessment of the need for any further tightening could be made at the November meeting. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.0 per cent. "]}},

Inflation in the major economies remained low. ", " The Board noted that recent data suggested that the US economy may have slowed a little from the strong growth recorded late last year, although at least some of this reflected the effects of particularly adverse winter weather across much of the country. Payrolls data suggested slower growth in employment over the previous two months, although the household survey showed much stronger growth and a further decline in the unemployment rate in January. Consumption and investment indicators were at higher levels in January than in earlier months, while the pace of recovery in the housing market appeared to have moderated. ", " There were further signs of a gradual recovery in the euro area, with a modest expansion in activity in the December quarter resulting in positive growth over the course of 2013. Output had increased in most euro area countries in the quarter. Measures of consumer and business confidence were around their long-run average levels, although unemployment rates remained elevated across much of the region. ", " In Japan, GDP growth was a little lower than expected in the December quarter, in part reflecting weakness in exports. Growth in domestic demand had remained strong, particularly in consumption ahead of the consumption tax increase in April. There was a small decline in inflation in January, and energy prices had stabilised so were not expected to add to inflation in coming months, although inflation would be boosted for a time by the effects of the tax increase. In the rest of east Asia, growth had picked up a little in the December quarter. In contrast, output growth in India remained relatively subdued and inflation was still high despite moderating recently. ", " For China, the recent data were more difficult to interpret at this time of the year owing to the Chinese New Year holiday. The limited data available suggested that growth may have moderated a little in early 2014. In particular, the manufacturing PMIs declined in January, suggesting that conditions in the manufacturing sector had softened somewhat. Even so, merchandise imports rose strongly in January, including imports from Australia. The Board was briefed about longer-run trends, which suggested that, while the working-age population was close to peaking, urbanisation was expected to continue in China for some time. Combined with likely increases in the size and quality of housing, this could underpin high levels of new urban residential construction over coming years. ", " Global commodity prices had been mixed over the month. Increases in the prices of base metals, gold and oil were offset by declines in iron ore and coal prices, which had drifted lower in recent months. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members began their discussion of the domestic economy with the labour market. They noted that wage growth remained subdued, in line with the weak conditions in the labour market and relatively low consumer and union inflation expectations. The wage price index rose by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, to be 2.6 per cent higher over the year, the lowest year-ended outcome since the series began in the late 1990s. Wage growth in the public sector over 2013 was around its slowest pace since 2000, consistent with ongoing fiscal restraint. Business surveys indicated that wage growth in the March quarter was likely to remain subdued, which was consistent with liaison reports that firms were having little difficulty finding suitable labour. ", " The unemployment rate had increased to 6 per cent in January, continuing its gradual increase of the past 18 months, while the participation rate had declined significantly since the middle of the previous year, largely because of a decrease in male participation. The level of employment was little changed over the past year, although total hours worked had increased. Members noted the recent high-profile announcements of future job losses against the backdrop of the 400,000 to 450,000 people who leave employment each month and the similar number who take up employment. They discussed the potential for the extensive coverage of these job losses adversely to affect consumer confidence. At the same time, there was evidence that forward-looking indicators of labour demand had stabilised, following earlier declines to low levels. ", " Growth in household spending looked to have picked up slightly in the December quarter, although the pace of growth was expected to remain a little below average for a time. Liaison suggested that the stronger retail sales seen in the latter months of last year had continued into the early part of this year, though sales growth may have eased somewhat. ", " Members observed that conditions in the established housing market had remained strong. Housing price inflation had declined somewhat from the fast pace recorded in 2013, although the data were less informative around this time of year owing to relatively low turnover. Ongoing strength in the established housing market and low lending rates were expected to support new dwelling activity. Dwelling investment was expected to record a slight decline in the December quarter, but a strong increase in approvals for residential buildings over recent months – both for higher-density and detached dwellings – pointed to a substantial increase in dwelling investment in subsequent quarters. Loan approvals and first home buyer grants for new dwellings had also increased of late. Members noted that construction firms were optimistic about the outlook and had reported a pick-up in enquiries from prospective new home buyers. ", " Survey measures of business conditions had edged higher in January and remained at above-average levels. The improvement in business sentiment in recent months had been broad based across industries. Mining investment was estimated to have declined in the December quarter, as expected, and non-mining investment had remained subdued. In the first reading for 2014/15, the ABS capital expenditure data suggested that a small improvement was in prospect for non-mining business investment. Members noted that the ABS capital expenditure survey reported that mining investment was expected to decline sharply in 2014/15, which had already been embodied in the Bank's forecasts for some time. ", " The December quarter national accounts were scheduled to be released the day after the March Board meeting. Overall, growth of domestic demand was estimated to have remained well below its trend pace in the quarter. Exports grew strongly in the December quarter, with resource exports increasing at a rapid pace, particularly for iron ore as additional capacity came on line, while services exports had been supported by an increase in international tourism. "], "Financial Markets": [" Conditions in financial markets had generally steadied over the past month as concerns about a number of emerging market economies had eased amid a general improvement in risk sentiment. Members noted, however, that some emerging market economies remained under pressure, while developments in Ukraine over recent days had weighed on general market confidence. In Russia, equities had fallen sharply and the rouble had depreciated, prompting an emergency rate increase and currency intervention by its central bank. ", " Sovereign bond yields in the major economies had shown little change through most of February, until late in the month when the situation in Ukraine led to falls in global bond yields. In Italy and Spain, yields had continued to fall, reaching their lowest levels since 2006. ", " Members also observed that global equity markets had rebounded in February, recovering most of the losses experienced around late January, with the US equity market recording new highs. The Japanese market was the notable exception, with equity prices recording further declines in an environment of heightened volatility. In emerging markets, equity prices had generally recovered part of their recent losses, while Australian equity prices had followed the major markets, rising by 4 per cent over February, underpinned by a solid reporting season. ", " In testimony to Congress in February, the new Chair of the US Federal Reserve indicated that a significant change to the outlook for the US economy would be required to change the Fed's intention to scale back its rate of asset purchases by $10 billion at each meeting. At this rate, asset purchases would end late in 2014. The first increase in the federal funds rate was not expected until late 2015. The European Central Bank also reiterated its expectation that its policy rate would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period, while the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced an expansion in its bank lending schemes. The latter would provide little direct additional stimulus but nevertheless emphasised that the BoJ remained committed to providing additional stimulus, if required, to meet its 2 per cent inflation target in 2015. ", " In China, liquidity conditions in money markets had eased throughout February, after markets reopened following the week-long Chinese New Year holiday. The 7-day interbank repo rate fell to its lowest level since May 2013, despite the People's Bank of China withdrawing liquidity. ", " Members were informed that foreign exchange markets generally had been subdued over the month, with the major currencies broadly unchanged and most emerging market currencies appreciating somewhat following the sharp falls in the previous month. The Chinese renminbi had depreciated slightly. The Australian dollar had appreciated a little, although it remained around 14 per cent below its peak in early April 2013. ", " Members noted that money market rates in Australia currently implied an expectation of no change in the cash rate for some time. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " Developments in major advanced banking systems had been broadly favourable over the past six months, apart from the euro area, where profitability remained weak and asset performance continued to deteriorate. Credit growth across the advanced economies remained slow, in contrast to emerging Asia, where financial conditions remained quite buoyant, although carrying a different set of risks. Market concerns about vulnerabilities in some emerging markets had returned in late January, but largely focused on country-specific issues rather than representing an across-the-board retreat from risk-taking. Members noted that the prospect of direct financial contagion from emerging markets to advanced economies was limited, because major banking systems had little exposure to these markets. The ongoing fragilities in the euro area meant, however, that some spillovers could occur if investor sentiment were to deteriorate more broadly. ", " The Australian banking system continued to perform strongly and remained well capitalised. Banks' asset performance had improved further. In line with this, their bad debt charges had declined and this had supported profitability. The major banks therefore appeared well placed to use internal capital generation to meet the higher capital requirements that they would face from 2016, having been designated by APRA as domestic systemically important banks. There was, however, less scope for future profit growth to come from further declines in bad debts or other costs, as they were already at low levels. ", " Members noted that rising housing prices and household borrowing were expected results from the monetary easing that had taken place. While these factors were helping to support residential building activity, they also had the potential to encourage speculative activity in the housing market. Lending to housing investors had been increasing for some time in New South Wales, and over the past six months it had also picked up in some other states. While such a pick-up would be unhelpful if it was a result of lenders materially relaxing their lending standards, current evidence indicated that there was little sign of this occurring. Members noted that the recent momentum in households' risk appetite and borrowing behaviour warranted close observation, but agreed that present conditions in the household sector did not pose a near-term risk to the financial system. Members discussed the experience in other countries where macroprudential tools had been utilised to slow demand for established housing and their possible application in Australia. ", " The demand for credit by businesses remained soft but this sector was no longer deleveraging. Indicators of distress in the business sector continued to decline, particularly the amount of non-performing loans related to commercial property. Prices of CBD office property had been rising in a few cities despite softening rents, which was consistent with some investors searching for higher yields. ", " Members were briefed on the outcomes of the recent G20 meetings in Sydney and the objectives for Australia's G20 presidency year in the area of financial regulation. They were also briefed on other international regulatory developments, including changes to institutional arrangements in several countries. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The pace of growth of Australia's major trading partners appeared to have remained around average. Domestically, timely indicators were consistent with some improvement in economic conditions over recent months, and there were further signs that the expansionary setting of monetary policy was having the desired effects. Indicators had been generally positive for consumption, housing investment, business conditions and exports. Mining investment had declined and was expected to fall further, while non-mining investment remained subdued and was expected to pick up gradually over time. Wage growth was at quite low rates, and if domestic costs remained contained some moderation in inflation for non-traded goods and services could be expected over time. These conditions would be expected to keep inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate. While the labour market remained weak, forward-looking indicators of labour demand appeared to have stabilised. ", " At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged, while noting that the cash rate could remain at its current level for some time if the economy was to evolve broadly as expected. Developments since the previous meeting had supported that assessment. There were further signs that low interest rates were providing support to activity, with improved economic conditions evident across a range of household and business indicators. While the labour market was expected to remain subdued for a while and wage growth had declined, the Board observed that this was consistent with conditions in the labour market usually lagging changes in economic activity. The decline in the exchange rate seen to date would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, though members noted that the exchange rate remained high by historical standards. ", " In light of this assessment, the Board's judgement was that it would be appropriate to maintain the current stance of policy. The Board would continue to examine the data over the period ahead, with members noting that, if the economy was to evolve broadly as expected, then the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

"], "International Conditions": [" In the United States, economic growth had slowed in the September quarter but the extent of the slowdown that was underway was uncertain. After five years of expansion, an easing in GDP growth was needed in order to prevent inflationary pressures from rising further. Growth in non-farm payrolls, which had been strong during the period of economic expansion, had also moderated in recent months. However, the unemployment rate had continued to trend down, and at 4.4 per cent in October, was close to previous low points at the end of the 1990s expansion. ", " The recent slowing in the US economy mainly reflected the downturn in the housing sector, with starts and permits to build up to September about 20 per cent lower than the peak six months earlier. If these indicators stabilised around current levels, this would take about 1 percentage point from overall growth, given that housing accounted for 5 per cent of economic activity in the US. There was some tentative evidence that the decline in housing construction activity was levelling out, but further falls were possible as were flow-on effects to other parts of the economy, notably consumption. At this stage, other parts of the economy were in good shape, with retail sales, for example, maintaining growth at a pace above 7 per cent. ", " Headline inflation in the US had declined to just over 2 per cent, reflecting sharp falls in gasoline prices in the past month or so. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, had risen from 2 per cent to just under 3 per cent over the past six months, the highest rate for 15 years. There had been some declines in the most recent monthly core inflation data, but the current annual rate still posed a level of discomfort for the Fed. ", " The key issue at present was whether the slowing in the US economy was going to spread more widely around the world, or whether there was sufficient strength in other economies to maintain a good pace of growth overall. At this stage, the evidence still supported the latter view. ", " There had been little new information over the past month on current economic conditions in Japan. The expansion in growth was continuing, but core inflation remained below zero, which was making the Bank of Japan cautious in its desire to tighten monetary policy further. The business sector was in good shape and the labour market was showing signs of increasing strength, with employment rising steadily and the job-offers-to-applicants ratio above 1 for the past few months. ", " In China, year-ended GDP growth for the September quarter had remained above 10 per cent, though it was a little slower than in the previous quarter. Elsewhere in east Asia, growth had been solid over the year to the June quarter at around 5 per cent, though quarterly growth in Korea, for example, had slowed a little since 2005. The weakness of investment in several Asian countries since the financial crisis in the second half of the 1990s was likely to crimp growth prospects somewhat in the future. ", " Economic performance in the euro area had been improving this year after a period of underperformance in the previous two years. Industrial production was now rising by over 4 per cent and measures of consumer and business confidence had increased steadily over the past year or so. GDP growth over the year to the June quarter had picked up to around 2¼ per cent. ", " In the UK, GDP growth was higher than in continental Europe over the year to the June quarter, at 2.8 per cent. The pattern of economic growth had exhibited some similarities with that in Australia in recent years, but in the UK there had been a degree of buoyancy in the housing sector recently that had not been present in Australia. ", " According to consensus forecasts, growth in the world economy was expected to be above average for the fifth consecutive year in 2007, at around 4¾ per cent, which would be only modestly lower than the fast pace likely to be recorded for 2006. Members observed that the average growth rate for the world economy had been drifting up in recent years as the share of the world economy represented by the advanced economies declined and that of emerging economies, such as China and India, grew. ", " The crude oil price had remained around US$60 per barrel over the past month. This was more than 20 per cent lower than the peak reached around the time of the Middle East conflict in August. "], "Domestic Conditions": [" Two topics provided the initial focus of discussion on domestic economic conditions. The first was the recently released ABS data on productivity growth from the annual national accounts, in particular how these might be relevant to reconciling the relatively low GDP growth rate reported for the year to June with other indicators that had shown rising growth rates in the first half of 2006, notably employment growth. The latest productivity data, which indicated that average annual growth in productivity between 2003/04 and 2005/06 was 0.6 per cent, revised up from the 0.1 per cent reported in the quarterly national accounts, went a small way to providing an answer but still left a puzzle. This could not be satisfactorily resolved by disaggregating the data by industry, though employment growth in the market sector was lower than that in the non-market sector. If genuine, the productivity data suggested the potential growth of the Australian economy was lower than previously thought. But it was also possible that the puzzle eventually would be at least partly resolved by further upward revisions to GDP growth. ", " The second topic was interest rates, in particular an examination of various benchmarks to assess the stance of monetary policy, should the recommendation to increase the cash rate at this meeting be adopted. These comparisons indicated that the cash rate in November (following a tightening of 25 basis points) would be noticeably above the average since 1993 and over the past decade. However, the effective rate on housing loans, i.e. taking account of discounts prevalent in the market, would be around the average since 1993 and only about 70 basis points above the average over the past decade. The effective rate on business loans would be lower than the average since 1993 and over the past decade, reflecting increased competition in that area of lending. ", " Turning to the standard high-frequency indicators of economic activity, retail sales were soft in September, though annual growth in the value of retail sales remained at around 6 per cent. Growth in recent months had slowed only for sales by small retailers; annual growth in sales by large retailers had increased from 3–4 per cent earlier to over 6 per cent in the past few months. ", " Consumer sentiment had increased in September and October after falling sharply in August, to be slightly above average. The volatility of this series made short-term movements difficult to interpret, but the broad movement over the past year indicated that sentiment had declined to a level that was close to average after having been well above average in the previous few years. ", " In the housing sector, construction activity appeared to be around its trough of this cycle. Building approvals, particularly for houses, were bottoming out in all states except Western Australia, where approvals continued to trend up. This suggested that housing activity would begin to provide a small positive impetus to overall growth in the year ahead. ", " In the secondary housing market, house prices were mostly flat in the September quarter, apart from in Perth, where they continued to increase very rapidly. Auction clearance rates had declined since mid year in both Sydney and Melbourne. ", " Housing finance approvals had been lower in August and September, which implied somewhat softer housing credit growth in the December quarter. Monthly growth in household credit had eased back to around 1 per cent, following strengthening in the first half of the year; annual growth in household credit was running at 12–13 per cent. Members discussed the sustainability of the current pace of debt accumulation in the household sector, concluding that it was difficult to determine the appropriate pace of debt accumulation, but that it could well continue around the current rate for some time. ", " Business credit growth was running at around 16 per cent per annum, though that was below the peak rate reached earlier in the year. ", " Turning to the trade sector, base metals prices had remained high in the past month and were more than 60 per cent higher over the year to date. Export receipts had increased in the September quarter, though most of this rise continued to reflect higher prices rather than higher volumes. ", " In further confirmation of the healthy condition of the labour market, employment increased strongly in September. The run of recent monthly increases had taken the year-ended growth rate to 2.7 per cent. The unemployment rate remained at 4.8 per cent, its lowest level in three decades. Members noted that a weaker run of monthly figures could well occur before long. ", " Capacity utilisation in the September quarter, as measured by the NAB survey of non-farm businesses, had risen to its highest level since the inception of the survey in the late 1980s. Capacity utilisation was high across most industries. Labour shortages, as indicated by the NAB survey and other business surveys, were also creating capacity strains. ", " The CPI data for the September quarter indicated that inflation had remained relatively high, at 0.7 per cent in the quarter and 3.9 per cent over the year. The year-ended result had been affected by rising petrol prices and very large price rises for bananas. Abstracting from these temporary factors, to remove the effect of outliers on both sides of the distribution of price changes, it was apparent that underlying inflation had increased since the beginning of the year and in recent quarters had been running at an annual rate of around 3 per cent. Price increases at the producer level had been intensifying also: domestic producer prices increased by more than 4 per cent over the year to the September quarter, and prices of imported items were flat following several years of price declines. ", " Petrol prices had fallen only slightly in the September quarter, but a large fall was projected for the December quarter, based on daily retail petrol prices for October and recent crude oil prices. ", " The Board was briefed on the revised staff forecast for inflation following receipt of the prices data for the September quarter. The outlook for underlying inflation was for it to remain around its recent level of around 3 per cent over the next two years. Headline inflation was forecast to fall to below 2 per cent during 2007 and thereafter to rise to be the same as the underlying rate. "], "Information Paper – The Drought": [" Members were briefed on the staffs assessment of the probable effects of the current drought on overall GDP growth and the inflation outlook. The severity of the drought was clear when considered from the perspective of both average rainfall, which measured dryness, and the total area of rainfall deficiency (i.e. rainfall below the 10th percentile), which measured how widespread drought conditions were. In particular, these indicators were most striking when looked at in terms of five-year averages, which indicated the persistence of drought conditions. Levels of stored water in non-metropolitan areas, which were important for the viability of irrigated summer crops, had not recovered from the effects of the previous drought in 2002; the dry conditions had been exacerbated by a noticeable rise in average temperatures in agricultural areas in recent years. ", " Updated forecasts of the reduction in supply of rural produce as a result of the drought had been provided by ABARE. The forecasts indicated a decline in farm GDP of around 20 per cent, slightly smaller than the decline in farm GDP in 2002/03 as on this occasion livestock production was expected to be less adversely affected. This would translate to a fall in overall GDP growth of ½ of a percentage point, with flow-on and indirect effects subtracting a further ¼ of a percentage point, though the indirect effects could be mitigated by government subsidies and various income-support measures. ", " The effect of the drought on the inflation outlook was quite modest in total. Past experience suggested that the net effect of drought on prices was fairly small, as in the first instance rises in the prices of some items (e.g. cereals) were roughly offset by falls in prices of others (e.g. meat), and several of these effects tended to be reversed in the period following drought. More generally, since the current drought would reduce GDP primarily by reducing the economy's supply capacity, the reduction in growth associated with the drought would not in itself do much to assist in relieving capacity constraints in the wider economy. "], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": [" In the past month, official interest rates in Europe had been increased. The ECB had increased its official rate to 3¼ per cent and the Swedish central bank raised rates to 2¾ per cent. Interest rates in Europe were still relatively low and further increases in the months ahead were expected. ", " The Bank of Japan had not changed official interest rates since June. Although rates were still very low and the Bank of Japan had signalled an intention to raise them further in due course, there was very little inflation in Japan at present. ", " In the US, the Fed also had not changed interest rates since June. It had been trying to counter market expectations that it would soon cut interest rates. Given recent strong data on the labour market, markets currently did not expect the Fed to cut rates in the next six months. ", " The RBNZ and Bank of England were expected to tighten monetary policy in the next few months. ", " Long-term interest rates had fallen noticeably since the middle of the year. The 10-year bond yield in the US was around 4.7 per cent, significantly below the federal funds rate. Rather than suggesting a severe slowing in the US economy and easing of monetary policy, it was more likely that longer-term yields were still being pushed down by a surplus of savings, particularly from Asia. Long-term bond yields in Asia were now lower than those in the US, despite higher credit risk and lower market liquidity. ", " The US share market had picked up noticeably in recent months and was 10 per cent higher this year. The decline in bond yields had probably contributed to the recent increases, but company earnings had continued to surprise on the upside. Share markets in Europe had also been strong in the past few months. Apart from the Japanese share market, which had shown little net change in 2006 following the sharp rise in 2005, most other countries' share markets had risen by 10–15 per cent this year. ", " The US dollar continued to be relatively steady on a trade-weighted basis, around 25–30 per cent below the peak in 2002. ", " The yen, on the other hand, had continued to decline, with the real value of the currency having fallen to the lowest level since the mid 1980s. The decline in the real exchange rate had reflected the combined effect of the fall in the nominal exchange rate and the decade of low inflation or deflation. The yen was pushed down as a consequence of the outflow of money from Japanese investors, who were seeking a better return than that available on domestic assets. The healthier real economy had given investors greater confidence to take on the foreign exchange risk associated with investment offshore. The lower exchange rate was a key channel for the easy monetary policy stance to stimulate the economy. ", " The Chinese authorities had continued to raise the exchange rate of the renminbi against the US dollar, with a net appreciation since mid 2005 of 5 per cent. However, on a trade-weighted basis the currency was still relatively low because of the fall, together with the US dollar, against other major currencies between 2002 and 2004. ", " In Australia, financial markets had fully priced in an interest rate increase at this meeting of the Board. Expectations of tightening had increased following the strong employment report for September and the high CPI outcome for the September quarter. Markets saw a 30 per cent chance of a further rate rise in February. ", " There had been little movement in longer-term yields over the past month. The 10-year bond yield was around 5¾ per cent, below the cash rate, as was also the case in the US. ", " Recent increases in interest rates and market expectations of further rises were starting to have an effect on home loan borrowers. The proportion of loan approvals at fixed rates had risen to 20 per cent, with most of these approvals for loans fixed for three years. There was no cost to fixing the loan rate for three years as the interest rate of 7¼ per cent was around the same as the rate on offer for discounted variable rate loans at present. Loan repayment arrears and repossessions remained very low. ", " The Australian share market rose sharply in October and was 15 per cent higher since the start of the year. The rise of 5 per cent in October, which was larger than the international average, was boosted by higher commodity prices, strong company profits and a number of company-specific events. ", " Analysts had begun to revise up again their estimates for profit growth in the year ahead; apart from a brief period recently, for the past three years analysts have continually had to revise up their estimates of profits in the year ahead. A similar pattern, but not to the same extent, had been seen in the US. ", " The overall price-earnings ratio for the Australian market had fallen over the past few years, reflecting share prices rising by less than profits. The current P/E ratio appeared to be around the average of the past decade or so, as did the dividend yield. This suggested the overall market was fairly valued, on the assumption that the current level of profits would be maintained. ", " There had been a pick-up in mergers and acquisitions activity recently; over the past year, such activity was running at around four times the rate of a few years earlier. There had also been a sharp rise in leveraged buy-out activity in the past year, but the amount of money involved remained small relative to share-market capitalisation. This pick-up, which had been driven by the use of relatively cheap debt finance to increase gearing of some companies, may have also encouraged some companies to increase their gearing in an attempt to reduce the risk of take-over. However, following the increase, aggregate corporate gearing had only moved back towards the longer-run average, following the low levels reached in recent years. Moreover, most of the increase in gearing had been undertaken by companies that had previously been lowly geared, and the gearing of mining companies had fallen because the addition to equity capital from retained earnings had exceeded the increase in debt. These observations suggested that developments in corporate gearing to date did not pose concerns. ", " The five major Australian banks had now all announced their profits for the 2005/06 financial year, mostly ending in September (except for the CBA, whose financial year ended in June). The banks had been important beneficiaries of the good economic performance of recent years. Underlying profits had risen by over 20 per cent in the year. After-tax return on equity of the major banks was 18 per cent, boosted slightly by some accounting changes to the definition of equity following the introduction of AIFRS. The decline in interest spreads that had occurred over the past decade had levelled out in the most recent year, around levels that were comparable internationally. Competitive pressures had continued on loan rates, but this had not been reflected in spreads as banks had not raised some deposit rates in line with increases in official interest rates. The banks had continued to cut costs, inducing a sharp fall in the aggregate cost-to-income ratio. Bad debt charges, as a percentage of loans, had remained low, but the steady fall seen over the past few years had levelled out. ", " The Australian dollar had risen to around US77 cents over the past month, towards the upper end of the range of the past two to three years. Recently, it had been supported by positive economic news, higher commodity prices and increased expectations of a further tightening of monetary policy. The TWI had also risen to around the top of its recent range. The main movement of the Australian dollar recently had been against the yen, with the current exchange rate above 90 yen, which was the highest in a decade. This reflected the weakness of the yen internationally. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent in November. ", " The main international factors in the Board's consideration of the recommendation were that growth was likely to continue at an above-average rate in 2007, even with a slowing in the US. On the domestic side, though the effects of the earlier increases in the cash rate in Australia were yet to have their full effect, the staff forecast for underlying inflation in Australia was for it to remain around 3 per cent over the next two years. High levels of commodity prices were continuing to add to domestic incomes and spending, capacity utilisation was at record levels and the labour market remained tight. The Board took careful note of the likely economic effects of the drought, noting in particular that it was unlikely to affect significantly the medium-term outlook for inflation. ", " The Board took account of the two increases in the cash rate earlier in the year, and noted that there was some evidence that those measures were affecting the demand for credit. Nonetheless, the Board judged that the risk of inflation exceeding 2–3 per cent in the medium term remained significant. It believed that a somewhat more restrictive stance of policy, by taking some pressure off demand, would improve the prospects of bringing inflation back towards 2½ per cent in due course. ", " Members also discussed the merits of tightening by 50 basis points, given that the effect on inflation of a single 25 basis point tightening was normally thought to be modest. On balance, members decided that the smaller move would be appropriate, for several reasons. First, the effect on inflation would reflect the accumulation of the three tightenings in 2006, and there was a degree of uncertainty as to how well the forecasts were able to account for the earlier measures. Secondly, given that a 25 basis point increase was widely anticipated by financial markets, a larger increase could prompt some unwelcome disruption and lead to unpredictable effects on expectations. Overall, the Board judged that a 25 basis point rise would leave policy with adequate flexibility to move further in the months ahead if needed.

Similarly, the growth in world trade volumes over recent months had been at, or even a little above, the average growth of the past few years. ", " In China, data for the first few months of 2014 had suggested a continuation of the easing in economic growth that had started in the latter part of 2013. While this moderation was evident across a range of indicators, members noted that the data for the early months of the year were difficult to interpret given the Chinese New Year holiday. In March, China's national legislature set the target for GDP growth in 2014 at 7.5 per cent, unchanged from 2013. Members noted that the authorities' concerns about credit growth might constrain stimulus measures in the event that some support for growth was needed. The targets for inflation and money growth in China were also unchanged for 2014. ", " Recent data for the United States were consistent with further moderate growth in the economy, even though adverse winter weather conditions had had a noticeable temporary effect on activity in the March quarter in at least some parts of the country. Indications were that consumption and business investment had continued to rise in recent months, and the increase in payrolls employment in February was close to the average pace over 2013. ", " In Japan, domestic demand growth had remained strong, with activity picking up prior to the consumption tax increase at the beginning of April. Inflation had fallen back slightly as the effects of higher energy prices following the depreciation of the yen had begun to diminish. There had been small increases in base wages offered by some large companies in recent negotiations, the first increases for some time. In the rest of east Asia, growth had continued at around the average of the past decade, while economic conditions in India remained subdued. In the euro area, GDP grew modestly in the December quarter, the third consecutive quarter of positive growth, and more recent indicators pointed to a further expansion in the March quarter. ", " Global commodity prices had declined since the previous Board meeting. The spot price for iron ore had been volatile over recent weeks, while steel prices in China had declined and spot prices for coking and thermal coal were well below current contract levels. The fall in the price of steel in China over recent weeks was consistent with a softening in demand. At the same time, the supply of steel appeared to have been constrained by a tightening in credit conditions reflecting the Chinese authorities' concerns about pollution. Base metals prices had also declined, though rural commodity prices were a little higher. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members began their discussion of the domestic economy with the labour market, which remained weak despite a strong rise in employment in February and an upward revision to employment in January. The unemployment rate had remained at 6 per cent in February and the participation rate had picked up. The ABS had cautioned that part of the change in employment and participation in the month had been attributable to larger-than-usual sampling variability. Members noted that, while the February data may have overstated the improvement in the labour market, it was also possible that the earlier data had overstated the weakness. Meanwhile, a range of indicators of labour demand suggested a modest improvement in prospects for employment, although the unemployment rate was still expected to edge higher for a time. ", " The national accounts, which had been released the day after the March Board meeting, reported that average earnings growth over the year to the December quarter 2013 had remained subdued. With measured growth in labour productivity around the average rate of the past two decades, nominal unit labour costs were unchanged over 2013. ", " Members recalled that the national accounts reported that GDP rose by 0.8 per cent in the December quarter and by 2.8 per cent over the year, which was a little stronger than had been expected. In the quarter, there had been further strong growth of resource exports, while growth in consumption and dwelling investment picked up a little and business investment declined. Public demand had made a surprisingly strong contribution to growth, but planned fiscal consolidation at state and federal levels was likely to weigh on public demand for some time. ", " Members observed that more recent economic indicators had generally been positive. Retail sales had increased by 1.2 per cent in January, continuing the pick-up in momentum that began in mid 2013. The Bank's liaison with firms suggested that, more recently, retail sales growth may have eased from this strong rate. Motor vehicle sales declined further in February, as had measures of consumer confidence over recent months, but the latter were still around their long-run averages. ", " Housing market conditions remained strong, with housing prices rising in March to be 10½ per cent higher over the year on a nationwide basis. Members noted that dwelling investment had increased moderately in the December quarter, with a pick-up in renovation activity, and that the high level of dwelling approvals in recent months foreshadowed a strong expansion in dwelling investment. ", " Data on business conditions released during the month had been somewhat mixed. Business investment fell in the December quarter, driven by a large decline in machinery and equipment investment and falls in engineering and non-residential building construction. While much of the decline appeared to have been driven by mining investment, non-mining business investment was also estimated to have declined in the quarter. More recently, non-residential building approvals had increased in January and, in trend terms, were at their highest level since 2008, with increases evident across a range of categories, including the office, industrial and ‘other commercial’ sectors. Some survey measures of business conditions had declined in the month, but most measures were around, or a bit above, average levels and also above levels recorded in mid 2013. Business surveys and information from the Bank's liaison suggested that businesses were still somewhat reluctant to commit to major investments, although the growth of business debt had picked up a little. ", " Members discussed the industry composition of output, investment and employment growth over the past two decades. They noted that employment growth had been spread across many industries, although the industries with the largest contributions to employment growth – particularly service industries – had not been the same industries with the largest contributions to growth of output and investment. Members noted that future employment growth was likely to continue to be concentrated in service industries. Data from the ABS capital expenditure survey indicated that a number of non-mining industries were expecting to increase their investment spending a little in the following financial year. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members observed that financial markets had been relatively quiet over March. The main focus had been the timing of policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve and uncertainty about the economic outlook in China. ", " The Federal Reserve further reduced its monthly rate of asset purchases at its March meeting by US$10 billion, as expected. At the same time, the Fed had revised its forward guidance framework, removing any reference to unemployment thresholds and instead indicating that policy rates were anticipated to remain unchanged for a ‘considerable time’ after the likely end of asset purchases later this year, although Fed officials also increased slightly their expectations for the future path of the policy rate. The market consequently brought forward its expectation of the first rate rise to the middle of 2015. ", " Members noted that government bond yields in the major markets of the United States, Germany and Japan were little changed over the month, while those in euro area periphery countries continued to decline significantly, with yields on government bonds in Spain and Italy falling to around their lowest levels since late 2005. Government bond yields in emerging markets had generally declined, with movements in yields dependent on perceptions about prospects for individual economies. ", " In Australia, longer-term government bond yields were little changed over the past month, with some rise at shorter maturities. Members also noted that the Australian Office of Financial Management had issued $7 billion of a new April 2026 bond – the largest on record – with very strong demand from both domestic and overseas investors. The latest data on ownership of Australian debt showed that foreign holdings of Commonwealth Government Securities were around two-thirds of the total, compared with around one-third for state government debt. ", " Credit markets were generally quiet over the month with corporate bond issuance in developed markets continuing at a similar pace to that in recent years, although issuance in emerging markets had declined over the past year, mainly reflecting less issuance by Chinese non-financial corporations. Credit risk in the Chinese corporate bond market had received more attention from investors and commentators over the past month after authorities allowed the first default in the onshore Chinese market to occur. In Australia, corporate bond spreads remained around their lowest levels since 2007/08 and issuance continued to be easily absorbed by the market, including issuance by lower-rated corporations and at longer maturities. ", " Global equity markets were little changed over the month, and the Australian equity market moved broadly in line with developments elsewhere. The experience across emerging markets was mixed, with Russia showing a large fall over the past month; however, equity markets in several other emerging market economies had recovered some of the losses that had occurred over the previous year. ", " Members observed that the major currencies had changed little since the previous Board meeting. The renminbi depreciated by 1 per cent against the US dollar, and the People's Bank of China had widened the daily trading band for the exchange rate from ±1 per cent to ±2 per cent in order to encourage greater two-way movement in the exchange rate. The Russian rouble had appreciated over the month as the Russian central bank continued to intervene on a relatively large scale in the foreign exchange market. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated, partly in response to domestic economic data, and it was now close to the level in November 2013, although on a trade-weighted basis the exchange rate was still about 12 per cent below its peak a year earlier. Members noted that the New Zealand dollar was currently at levels equivalent to historical peaks against the Australian dollar, following the tightening of monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. ", " Members completed their discussion of financial markets by noting that money market rates in Australia continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the remainder of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Overall, growth in Australia's major trading partners looked to have remained around average in the early months of 2014, although there were signs that growth in China had eased. Domestically, growth over 2013 had been below trend pace. Members noted that while falling mining investment and weak public demand were set to constrain growth for some time, there were early promising signs in other parts of the economy. In particular, a strong pick-up in dwelling investment was in prospect and there was some evidence that consumer demand had strengthened a little. Indicators for exports remained strong, while those for business conditions were generally higher than they had been in 2013. However, many businesses appeared to be waiting for an increase in current demand to occur before they were willing to increase investment spending. ", " Information on wages pointed to moderate growth, which was expected to help contain domestic inflationary pressures. While there had been some tentative evidence of a slight improvement in a number of labour market indicators, conditions would need to improve further before the unemployment rate could be expected to decline. ", " At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged and members noted that the cash rate could remain at its current level for some time if the economy was to evolve broadly as expected. Developments over the past month had not changed that assessment. There had been further signs that low interest rates were supporting domestic activity. Members noted that the exchange rate remained high by historical standards. Despite commodity prices falling further over the past month, the exchange rate had appreciated a little further. While the decline in the exchange rate from its highs a year earlier would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, this would be less so than previously expected given the rise in the exchange rate over the past few months. ", " On the basis of this assessment, the Board's judgement was that monetary policy was appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the 2–3 per cent inflation target. The Board would continue to monitor developments in the economy, with members noting that, on present indications, the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

The recovery in the US economy had strengthened through the second half of 2013, driven by private demand, particularly consumption. The recovery appeared to have been building momentum and the recent agreement to lessen the automatic cuts to federal government spending implied a more favourable outlook for public demand. Housing market conditions remained generally positive and the labour market continued to improve. Conditions in the euro area had improved a little, although they remained weak overall. ", " In China, growth had remained a little above the government's target of 7.5 per cent. Growth in 2013 was supported by strong domestic demand, including from both consumption and investment. Members observed that net exports did not contribute to growth in 2013 and had not done so for several years. Chinese steel and iron ore prices had declined since the previous Board meeting and iron ore prices were expected to decline gradually over time as global capacity expanded further. ", " Economic conditions in Japan had shown further improvement. Consumption had strengthened in advance of the increase in the consumption tax in April 2014 and indicators of business investment had improved. In the rest of east Asia, growth in the second half of 2013 appeared to have been close to its average of the past decade and had been broad based across private consumption, investment and exports. In India, there had been tentative signs that growth in economic activity had increased, helped by better conditions for agricultural production, and inflation had eased a little, although it remained high. ", " Inflation in the major economies remained low, although it had increased in Japan. ", " Members noted that the forecast for overall growth of Australia's major trading partners was little changed from that presented three months earlier. In 2014, trading partner growth was expected to be a little higher than in 2013, at around 4½ per cent, before returning to its decade average of around 4 per cent in 2015. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by focusing on the higher-than-expected reading for consumer price inflation in the December quarter. The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.9 per cent in the December quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, to be 2.7 per cent higher over the year. Underlying inflation, according to a range of measures, was between ¾ and 1 per cent in the December quarter and a touch above 2½ per cent over the year. ", " Members noted that there were several possible explanations for the higher-than-expected inflation outturn. One was that it could reflect an element of noise that occurs in economic data. Alternatively, it could be that pass-through from the lower exchange rate was occurring more quickly than usual, or that pass-through of lower growth in wages was occurring more slowly than usual. It was also possible that there was less spare capacity, enabling retailers or wholesalers to increase their margins. With the available information it was not possible at this stage to distinguish between these explanations, and it was likely that some combination of them was at work. ", " Part of the increase in underlying inflation was attributable to tradables prices, which had picked up in recent quarters following the depreciation of the exchange rate. Non-tradables inflation (abstracting from increases in administered prices) also increased in the quarter. Some of this was due to higher inflation in housing costs, with the cost of new dwellings rising as housing construction picked up. Members noted that the increase in non-tradables inflation was somewhat at odds with the soft growth in labour costs associated with the weak labour market. ", " Turning to the labour market, members noted that the unemployment rate had continued to edge higher in recent months, to 5.8 per cent in December, and that the participation rate had dipped further and had declined noticeably since mid 2013. Members were informed that the ageing of the population accounted for around half of the decline in the participation rate over the past few years. There had been little growth in employment over the past year or so and average hours worked had also declined over recent months, after a period earlier in 2013 when hours worked had been growing more rapidly than employment. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, such as vacancies and job advertisements, had shown signs of stabilising in recent months, but remained at low levels and were consistent with only moderate growth of employment in the months ahead. ", " Data released since the previous Board meeting suggested that the domestic economy had continued to grow at a below-trend pace over the second half of 2013, although a range of indicators were more positive for economic activity around the turn of the year. ", " Members noted that the September quarter national accounts data, released the day after the December Board meeting, reported that GDP increased by 0.6 per cent in the September quarter and by 2.3 per cent over the preceding year. Growth of domestic demand had remained weak, with non-mining investment subdued and fiscal restraint constraining public demand. Consumption growth had been below average. In contrast, exports had grown strongly over the year, contributing to aggregate growth, and this was expected to continue. ", " More timely indicators of consumption had picked up of late. Growth of retail sales increased towards the end of 2013 and the Bank's liaison suggested that sales around the Christmas and New Year period were reasonably good. Motor vehicle sales to households increased in the December quarter. Consumer sentiment had recorded a modest decline around the end of 2013, but it remained a little above average. While weak conditions in the labour market had weighed on consumption growth, the increase in housing and equity prices over the past year raised the possibility that consumption growth could outpace that of income in the period ahead. ", " Members noted that the effects of low interest rates were clearly evident in the housing market, where prices had increased further and turnover had picked up to be just below average. These conditions were expected to provide further support to new dwelling activity over the period ahead, and leading indicators of dwelling investment had increased. Members observed that the softness in commercial construction meant that there was labour available to support the strong growth of higher-density dwelling construction. Growth of housing credit was gradually picking up, particularly so for investors. ", " Survey measures suggested that business conditions had improved noticeably in recent months, to be above average levels. The more forward-looking confidence measures were around average levels. ", " Members discussed the staff forecast for the domestic economy, which was a little stronger over the next year or so than at the time of the November <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. In part, this owed to the lower exchange rate, which was expected to boost activity in the traded sector. GDP growth was expected to strengthen a little through 2014, though would be likely to be at a below-trend pace. Growth was then expected to pick up to an above-trend pace by mid 2016. The outlook for the labour market was little changed, as the effect of the softer tone of the recent employment data had been largely offset by the slightly stronger growth outlook. ", " The inflation forecasts had been revised higher, reflecting a combination of the lower exchange rate and the higher-than-expected December quarter CPI outcome, slightly offset by a softer outlook for wages growth. Underlying inflation was expected to be around 3 per cent over the year to mid 2014 and was then expected to decline towards 2.5 per cent. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion with the two main issues that financial markets had focused on since the December Board meeting: namely, the differing policy paths of the three major central banks and the increased tensions appearing in some emerging market economies. ", " Having commenced the reduction in its asset purchases at its December meeting, the US Federal Reserve had continued that process at its January meeting. The Fed noted that, while further reductions in asset purchases were likely, it was not on a preset course. Market expectations were for the purchases to be phased out by the end of the year. The Fed had again stressed that the policy rate would be likely to be kept at zero for a considerable period. Accordingly, the market did not expect the Fed to increase the policy rate until late 2015. ", " The European Central Bank (ECB) had made it clear that it would take further action if existing measures were not sufficient to address the risk of deflation in the euro area. The ECB's balance sheet had continued to shrink, reflecting prepayment of lending under the ECB's earlier three-year longer-term refinancing operations. Members noted that the resulting fall in excess liquidity had occasionally seen higher interest rates in the interbank market. However, conditions in European sovereign debt markets had continued to improve, with spreads between yields on German government bonds and those issued by the euro area periphery countries narrowing sharply. Members noted that yields had not been adversely affected by the heightened tensions in some emerging markets. Indeed, Ireland, Portugal and Spain had raised significant amounts in bond issues in January. ", " The Bank of Japan (BoJ) had continued to increase its holdings of Japanese government bonds in line with its plan announced in April 2013. While the BoJ appeared to be confident that its measures would be effective, it stood ready to increase stimulus if it anticipated that it would not reach its price stability target in 2015. ", " Members noted that the major currencies were largely unchanged on a trade-weighted basis since the previous Board meeting. Over 2013, the US dollar had appreciated by 3 per cent on a trade-weighted basis, with a marked appreciation against the Japanese yen and a number of emerging market and commodity currencies (including the Australian dollar) partly offset by a modest depreciation against various European currencies and the Chinese renminbi. The euro had also appreciated on a trade-weighted basis over the course of 2013, with a significant appreciation against the yen as well. ", " Members noted the 3 per cent depreciation of the Australian dollar on a trade-weighted basis over the past two months. The currency was 15 per cent below its most recent peak in early April 2013 and around the levels of mid 2010. ", " In contrast to the instability in bond markets observed in the first half of 2013, when reduced asset purchases were first mooted, the Fed's December decision had little lasting impact on yields. Financial markets also appeared fairly confident that a compromise would be reached in the US Congress to lift the debt ceiling in February. ", " Equity prices in the major markets were broadly unchanged since the beginning of December, despite some large movements in both directions over the previous two months. Equity markets rose solidly in December to record large gains over 2013, including rises of 30 per cent in the United States and almost 60 per cent in Japan. Although price-earnings ratios in the major markets had remained close to longer-term averages, the start of the new year had seen most share markets decline, mainly as a result of the growing concerns in emerging markets. That was also the case in Australia, where the share market had generally underperformed most of the major markets over the course of 2013, rising by 15 per cent. Resource stocks recorded a small decline over the year. ", " Members also observed that financial conditions had become considerably more unsettled in some emerging market economies in recent months. Investors' exposures to emerging markets had been reassessed since the Fed first foreshadowed an end to its asset purchase program in mid 2013. The Fed's decision at its December meeting to start reducing its asset purchases had had little direct effect. Nonetheless, during January some country-specific risk factors, in an environment of generally decreased investor appetite for emerging market exposure, had seen financial markets in some emerging markets come under pressure. Some central banks had responded to the pressures on their exchange rates by raising interest rates, though members also noted that some other countries had been less affected in the current episode than had been the case in mid 2013. ", " In China, periods of pressure had persisted in the money market, with the People's Bank of China at times not responding with as large an injection of liquidity as in the past when money market rates increased. The Chinese equity market had weakened over the past two months. ", " Members noted that current market pricing in Australia suggested little chance of a change in monetary policy at present. While advertised interest rates on home and business loans were generally unchanged, average interest rates on loans outstanding had continued to fall. The overall funding composition of Australian banks was little changed, with deposits remaining the dominant source of funding, but there had been a shift from term to at-call deposits in response to changes in relative interest rates. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Data received over the past two months suggested that global economic conditions had evolved broadly as expected and there were reasonable prospects that growth of Australia's major trading partners would increase to be a bit above average in 2014. For the domestic economy, growth of activity looked to have been a bit below trend over the second half of 2013. Members recognised that conditions in the labour market tended to lag economic growth, and that the labour market had remained weak following the period of below-trend growth in activity. ", " There were further signs that the expansionary setting of monetary policy was having the expected effects, with more timely indicators having been more positive for consumption, dwelling investment, business conditions and exports. Although inflation in the December quarter had been higher than expected, there were several possible explanations. The Board noted that it was likely the inflation reading contained some noise as well as some signal about inflationary pressures, but also presented something of a puzzle in interpreting the mix of activity and price data. Also, the further depreciation of the exchange rate since the December meeting was expected to add to inflation for a time, although the outlook for slightly slower wage growth was expected to help keep domestic cost pressures contained over the medium term. ", " At recent meetings, the Board had judged that, given the substantial degree of monetary policy stimulus already in place, it was prudent to keep policy unchanged while assessing the continuing impact of that stimulus. There had been further signs in recent months that policy was having its intended effects. The exchange rate had also depreciated further since the December meeting. If sustained, a lower exchange rate would be expansionary for economic activity and assist in achieving balanced growth of the economy. ", " In light of this, the Board's judgement was once again that it would be prudent to keep interest rates unchanged. The Board would continue to examine the data over the period ahead to assess whether monetary policy remained appropriate, with members noting that, if the economy evolved broadly as expected, the most prudent course would likely be a period of stability in interest rates.

Commodity prices, notably those for iron ore and oil, had continued to decline. Members noted that these price developments could be largely explained by increases in supply, although easing demand was also a factor. The fall in oil prices was expected to contribute to lower headline consumer price inflation in many of Australia's trading partners and, other things being equal, lower oil prices were likely to spur higher growth in many economies. Very accommodative financial conditions in the major economies continued to support global growth. ", " GDP growth in China in the September quarter was consistent with the authorities' objectives. Members observed that housing prices in China had fallen again in October but by less than in previous months. The ongoing weakness in housing markets had been reflected in a further easing in growth in investment and industrial production; lower growth in steel production had contributed to lower iron ore prices in recent months. Policymakers in China had responded to weakness in some sectors of the economy and this was expected to support growth in the near term. There were tentative signs that conditions in the housing market were stabilising. ", " In Japan, GDP fell in the September quarter against expectations of a small rise. Members noted that the weakness was spread across most components of expenditure. In contrast, recent indicators suggested that conditions in the labour market had remained tight. Output growth for the September quarter in the rest of east Asia had been around its average of recent years. ", " The US economy had grown at an above-trend pace in the September quarter and the unemployment rate had declined further. Core inflation had increased relative to a year earlier, but remained about ½ percentage point below the Federal Open Market Committee's goal of 2 per cent. ", " Members noted that the recovery in the euro area remained fragile. The unemployment rate had declined a little during 2014 but remained high, and inflation was well below the European Central Bank's target of close to, but below, 2 per cent. Members also observed that differences in growth across euro area countries could partly be explained by the different levels of national competitiveness. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the data available at the time of the meeting had indicated that GDP growth was likely to be a bit below average in the September quarter. Resource exports had continued to grow strongly in the September quarter and further expansions in iron ore production were expected to continue supporting resource exports in the near term. Production of liquefied natural gas was also likely to start increasing gradually over the course of the next year. Mining investment looked to have declined in the September quarter and further substantial declines were expected. Fiscal consolidation at all levels of government in Australia was also expected to weigh on GDP growth for a time. ", " The available data suggested that dwelling investment was likely to subtract a little from growth in the September quarter. However, building approvals and other forward-looking indicators of residential building activity continued to suggest that dwelling investment would contribute to growth in coming quarters. Aggregate housing price growth had slowed a little and continued to display considerable regional variation, with housing price growth strongest in Sydney. Members noted that credit to owner-occupiers was growing at a pace only a little above that of income, but that growth in credit to investors was considerably higher. ", " Members noted that the strength in the housing market and data on retail sales, for example, indicated that household consumption growth was likely to have picked up a little from the pace recorded in recent quarters. However, they recognised that the labour market had remained subdued and that this was restraining growth in labour income. The unemployment rate had risen over the past six months, employment growth had been somewhat below the pace of population growth and wage growth had remained low in the September quarter. Forward-looking indicators also remained consistent with expected relatively moderate growth in employment over coming months. ", " Data from the ABS capital expenditure survey was consistent with expectations that non-mining investment would grow modestly in the current financial year. Members noted that a number of more timely indicators of activity in the non-mining business sector, such as the measure of business conditions from the NAB survey, recent data on business credit and growth in profits of the corporate non-mining sector, were consistent with this assessment. "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board discussed how financial markets over the past month had responded to the increasingly divergent outlooks for monetary policy in the major economies. In particular, members discussed the effects of recent policy announcements in Japan. ", " Members had been advised at the November meeting that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) had unexpectedly announced an expansion of its monetary easing program at its late October meeting, by increasing its rate of purchases of Japanese government bonds. These purchases were expected to result in a substantial increase in measures of ‘base money’. In gross terms, the BoJ's purchases would also account for around two-thirds of all new issuance of government bonds over the coming year, with purchases exceeding new issuance for bonds with a maturity of 5−10 years. ", " The Board assessed the prospect of an increase in the rate of purchases of offshore assets by Japanese residents following the recent easing in the monetary policy of the BoJ and the announcement by Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) that it would reallocate its portfolio more towards domestic equities and foreign assets and less towards domestic bonds. Members noted that the effect of these actions was expected to result in further sizeable capital outflows from Japan in the period ahead. While the bulk of these were likely to be to the United States, Australia would probably see some significant flows as well, with consequent effects on exchange rates. ", " Members noted that the European Central Bank (ECB) had also reiterated its intention to expand its balance sheet by around €1 trillion back towards its previous peak in 2012 and had indicated a willingness to adjust the size and composition of its asset purchases further to achieve that objective. ", " Overall, members noted that the actions of the BoJ and ECB would result in total liquidity provided by major central banks increasing at a similar pace to that observed over recent years, notwithstanding the Federal Reserve's large asset purchase program having ended in October. Such an expansion could, however, occur against a backdrop of rising US interest rates. ", " Among other central banks, the People's Bank of China (PBC) announced the first reduction in its benchmark interest rates since mid 2012. In part, this was a further step on the path of financial liberalisation, but it also appeared to reflect a deliberate easing in monetary conditions. At the same time, members noted that the PBC continued to restrict credit provision in the shadow banking sector. ", " Turning to foreign exchange markets, members noted the 7 per cent depreciation of the yen against the US dollar, and on a trade-weighted basis, following the announcements by the BoJ and the GPIF. In addition to its marked appreciation against the yen, the US dollar had appreciated a little against most other currencies over November, to be 6 per cent higher on a trade-weighted basis since the middle of the year. Members noted that the Korean authorities had recently expressed concern about the depreciation of the yen, although the won had still depreciated significantly against the US dollar over November and also on a trade-weighted basis. The euro was little changed over the month and remained 5 per cent below its May 2014 peak on a trade-weighted basis. The Swiss franc had appreciated further against the euro over the month to be only marginally below the Swiss National Bank's ceiling. The Russian rouble declined sharply over the previous month to be around 20 per cent lower against the US dollar. ", " In part reflecting these exchange rate movements, over the past month the Australian dollar had appreciated by 5 per cent against the yen and 3 per cent  against the won, but had depreciated to a four-year low against the US dollar. The Australian dollar had also depreciated against the renminbi (which continued to track recent movements in the US dollar) to be only slightly lower on a trade-weighted basis than at the beginning of the year, although members noted that the terms of trade and key commodity prices had fallen significantly further since that time. ", " Members noted that sovereign bond yields in the United States and Europe had generally declined over the course of November, with German yields reaching new lows. Australian government bond yields had also declined, with the yield on 10-year bonds falling below 3 per cent and the spread to US treasuries narrowing to its lowest level in eight years. ", " Equity prices in the advanced economies had increased over the past month, with the US and Japanese markets more than fully retracing the falls experienced over recent months to reach multi-year highs. Japanese equity prices had increased strongly following the announcements by the BoJ and the GPIF, while Australian equity prices declined over the month and were little changed over the year to date. The underperformance of the Australian market reflected the poor performance of equity prices of mining and energy companies, which were around 20 per cent  lower in response to falls in iron ore, coal and oil prices. ", " Bond issuance by Australian banks in 2014 to date had been solid in both gross and net terms, although the overall funding mix of the banks was little changed. Members noted that conditions in the Australian residential mortgage-backed securities market were strong at present, with high levels of issuance and relatively tight pricing. Competition in the deposit market had continued to ease and interest rates on certain savings accounts had declined noticeably over the past year or so. Lending rates on the stock of outstanding housing and business loans remained at historically low levels. ", " Financial market pricing indicated that the Board was expected to leave the cash rate unchanged at the December meeting, with some chance of an easing in 2015. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In assessing the stance of monetary policy in Australia, members noted that the outlook for the global economy was little changed over the past month, with growth of Australia's major trading partners forecast to be a little above average in 2014 and 2015. Commodity prices, particularly those for iron ore and oil, had declined over the year to date. Demand-side factors, such as the weakness in Chinese property markets, had played a role over recent months, though expansions in global supply appeared to have played a larger role earlier in the year. Global financial market conditions had remained very accommodative. ", " Domestically, the data that had become available over the month suggested that the forces underpinning the outlook for domestic activity were much as they had been for some time. GDP growth was still expected to be below trend over 2014/15 before gradually picking up to an above-trend pace towards the end of 2016. Mining investment was expected to decline sharply and resource exports were expected to grow strongly as the transition from the investment to the production phase of the mining boom continued. Very low interest rates had supported activity in the housing market, which in turn was expected to support consumption. However, members noted that subdued labour market conditions were likely to weigh on consumption growth and consumer confidence more generally. With spare capacity in labour and product markets likely to weigh on domestic inflationary pressures for some time, the inflation outlook remained consistent with the target of 2 to 3 per cent, notwithstanding some temporary upward pressure from the recent depreciation of the exchange rate. ", " Members noted that the current accommodative setting of monetary policy was expected to support demand and help growth strengthen at the same time as delivering inflation outcomes consistent with the target over the next two years. Despite the depreciation of the exchange rate, the Australian dollar remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices over recent months. Members agreed that further exchange rate depreciation was likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy. They noted that market expectations implied some chance of an easing of policy during 2015 and discussed the factors that might be producing such an expectation. ", " On the information available, the Board judged that the current stance of monetary policy continued to be appropriate for fostering sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. Members considered that the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

They noted that the slight moderation in growth of Australia's major trading partners in the March quarter was expected to be temporary. ", " In China, GDP growth and other indicators of activity eased a little in early 2014; however, in year-ended terms, growth was still consistent with the government's annual target of <span class=\"no-wrap\">7½ per cent</span>. There were some signs that the recent slowing could be temporary, with real fixed asset investment growing at a similar pace to recent quarters and the authorities indicating a willingness to support investment growth, if needed, to achieve the target for output growth. Members also noted that the flow of new total social financing had remained lower than over most of 2013, consistent with the authorities' efforts to place financing on a more sustainable footing. ", " Chinese steel prices remained below the average of recent years, notwithstanding a slight increase over the past month. Lower steel prices were consistent with some easing in Chinese steel demand, as well as some apparent tightening in credit conditions for steel production and the use of iron ore as collateral for borrowing. ", " In Japan, economic activity appeared to have increased strongly in the March quarter, prior to the increase in the consumption tax in April, but recent surveys had pointed to a subsequent decline in business conditions. It remained uncertain whether the planned fiscal stimulus measures would offset the expected decline in household expenditure following the consumption tax increase. After rising earlier, consumer price inflation had stabilised in recent months, but early indicators confirmed that April would see a sharp, temporary rise in inflation in response to the tax increase. ", " In the rest of east Asia, output growth appeared to have been around its decade-average pace and exports had been growing at a similar rate to recent years. ", " The US economy was showing signs of moderate growth. While the economy recorded negligible GDP growth in the March quarter, primarily because of the effect of adverse weather, more recent monthly indicators had been consistent with further economic recovery. Members noted, in particular, that the labour market had continued to improve, with a large increase in non-farm payrolls recorded in April. Over the past six months, non-farm payrolls employment had increased at a touch above the average pace of the past few years and the participation rate had increased a little. ", " Economic activity in the euro area was picking up gradually, although spare capacity remained substantial. Members observed that inflation had declined further over recent months to rates that were below the European Central Bank's target in all countries. This remained a concern for policymakers, even though price declines in some of the periphery economies had helped to improve their competitiveness. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the inflation outcome for the March quarter was a little lower than most analysts had expected, following a surprisingly high outcome for the December quarter. The recent pattern of quarterly inflation appeared to overstate the changes in inflationary pressures and, in year-ended terms, underlying inflation in the March quarter was around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½–2¾ per cent</span>. Year-ended CPI inflation was slightly higher, at 2.9 per cent, with a little under <span class=\"no-wrap\">¼ percentage point</span> due to the rise in the tobacco excise in December. ", " Over the past year as a whole, the increase in tradables prices was broadly consistent with the depreciation of the exchange rate over that period. Year-ended inflation in non-tradables prices had slowed to around 3 per cent, noticeably lower than the average of around 4 per cent over the past decade. This slowing had been influenced by the decline in wage growth over the preceding year or so and was more evident in the prices of market services, for which labour costs were a key determinant of prices. ", " Labour market conditions had shown some signs of improvement for a number of months, following the pick-up in economic activity from late 2013. The unemployment rate declined a little in March, although members noted that monthly movements in labour market data could be volatile. The participation rate appeared to have stabilised and employment growth had strengthened in recent months. Forward-looking indicators had also improved, but remained at low levels and were consistent with relatively moderate employment growth in coming months. ", " Overall, the pace of economic activity had increased over the previous six months, with the economy looking to have grown at around its long-run average pace in the March quarter, driven by especially strong growth of exports. With this pace of export growth unlikely to be sustained, output growth was expected to be somewhat slower over the next few quarters. ", " Following strong growth at the beginning of the year, retail sales growth appeared to have moderated somewhat more recently. Low interest rates and rising housing prices continued to support household consumption and, notwithstanding recent volatility, measures of consumer sentiment remained around long-run average levels. ", " The housing market continued to be an area of strength in the economy. Although the most recent data had indicated a decline, dwelling approvals remained at high levels and the flow-on to commencements pointed to strong growth in dwelling investment in the first half of 2014. Across Australia, housing price inflation had eased somewhat in recent months from the earlier rapid pace, with auction clearance rates edging back and housing loan approvals stabilising. Other indicators, such as turnover, first home owner grants and loan approvals for new housing, remained consistent with strong demand for both established and new housing. ", " The volume of iron ore and coal exports had risen strongly over recent months. Additional capacity for these commodities was still coming on line, although exports were expected to grow at a slower rate than in 2013. ", " Survey measures of business conditions that had become available over the previous month had been mixed, but a number of surveys suggested that business sentiment remained around average levels after increasing from the lows in the middle of 2013. Notwithstanding the decline in non-residential building approvals over recent months, the stock of work to be done was at a high level, suggesting that business investment in construction could pick up. ", " Members discussed the staff forecasts for the domestic economy, noting that average GDP growth over the forecast period was little changed from the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. Over 2014/15, GDP growth was expected to be a bit below trend, with the effects of monetary stimulus partly offset by the downturn in mining investment and planned fiscal consolidation. Growth was subsequently expected to pick up to an above-trend pace over 2015/16, with both non-mining business investment and LNG exports forecast to contribute to growth. Although employment growth was anticipated to strengthen, this was not likely to exceed population growth consistently for some time as the improvement in the labour market was expected to be relatively protracted. ", " Members observed that the forecast for underlying inflation had been little changed and that underlying inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the forecast period. This outlook reflected the effect of two opposing influences. Domestic inflationary pressures were likely to remain subdued, reflecting spare capacity in labour and product markets weighing on labour costs and profit margins for some time. Working in the other direction, with the exchange rate remaining lower than a year earlier, higher import prices were expected to exert an upward influence on inflation for several years, albeit by a bit less than had been anticipated a few months earlier. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members opened their discussion of financial markets with the observation that the past month had been largely uneventful, with little change in government bond yields and share prices in the major economies and stability in most exchange rates. Volatility in many asset classes was at multi-year lows. ", " At its April meeting, the US Federal Reserve had continued the process of scaling back its asset purchases, reducing monthly purchases by a further US$10 billion to US$45 billion. The Fed reiterated that it expected the federal funds rate to remain unchanged for a ‘considerable period’ after asset purchases were anticipated to end later this year, and financial markets continued to expect the first increase in the policy rate to occur around mid 2015. The European Central Bank also kept policy unchanged at its meeting in early April, as well as indicating a preparedness to use additional measures – asset purchases and a negative deposit rate – if the medium-term outlook for inflation subsequently softened or financial conditions tightened. The Bank of Japan left its rate of asset purchases unchanged during April and was now buying more assets each month than the Fed, while also foreshadowing another increase in purchases if necessary to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target. ", " While government bond yields in the major markets were little changed over the past month, yields on government bonds in euro area periphery countries had fallen further to multi-year lows. Greece had raised €3 billion of five-year debt. This was Greece's first issuance of long-term debt in four years and the issue was around seven times oversubscribed. Emerging market government bond yields generally fell over April, as capital flows to these countries resumed. In Australia, government bond yields also declined over the past month, partly in response to the lower-than-expected inflation data. ", " Members noted that credit market conditions were very favourable in most markets, with corporate spreads in Australia approaching pre-crisis levels. In the case of recent issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities in Australia, several securities involved mortgages written by non-bank originators. ", " Equity prices in advanced economies, including Australia, had been a little higher over the past month, whereas equity prices in most emerging markets had increased strongly, with Russia a notable exception. ", " Members observed that the major currencies had changed little over April, with volatility at multi-year lows. The Australian dollar had also shown little change over the past month and remained around 6 per cent higher in trade-weighted terms than in late January, although it was still around 10 per cent lower than a year earlier. The Chinese renminbi had depreciated further, to be around 5 per cent lower in trade-weighted terms than earlier in the year. Chinese foreign exchange reserves recorded another strong rise in the March quarter. ", " The funding composition of Australian banks had changed little over recent months, though members noted a switch from term deposits to at-call deposit accounts. Secondary market spreads on covered and other bonds issued by the major banks had also changed little in April, and these remained around their lowest levels since 2007/08. The marginal cost of new wholesale debt issuance by the major banks declined over the month and remained relatively low, while the average outstanding spread was broadly unchanged. ", " Members noted that money market rates in Australia continued to imply that no change in the cash rate was expected at this meeting and over the rest of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that there had been little change in the outlook for the global economy, with growth of Australia's major trading partners in the year ahead still forecast to be around average. The latest data received on the domestic economy had evolved much as expected, with further indications that growth had picked up a little over the past two quarters. This had been driven by very strong exports as well as an increase in the growth of consumption and dwelling investment. However, the Board noted that overall growth in coming quarters was likely to be below trend given expected slower growth in exports, the decline in mining investment and the planned fiscal consolidation. ", " While a range of indicators suggested that conditions in the labour market had improved in recent months, the demand for labour remained subdued and was likely to remain so for some time. This had led to lower wage growth, which in turn had seen inflation decline for non-tradable items whose prices were more sensitive to labour costs. This was being offset by stronger inflation for tradable items as a result of the depreciation of the exchange rate over the previous year. Inflation was consistent with the target and was forecast to remain so over the next couple of years. ", " At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. The expansionary setting of monetary policy continued to have the expected effects on economic activity. Notably, a sustained increase in dwelling investment was in prospect, consumption had strengthened a little and business conditions were around average levels. Recent developments had indicated that the economy had evolved broadly in line with earlier expectations, resulting in little change in the updated forecasts for activity and inflation. With growth in activity expected to pick up only gradually, and spare capacity in the labour market consequently remaining for some time, growth in domestic costs was forecast to remain contained, which would help to offset the ongoing effect on prices from the depreciation of the exchange rate over the past year. Given this outlook for the economy and the significant degree of monetary stimulus already in place to support economic activity, the Board considered that the current accommodative stance of policy was likely to be appropriate for some time yet.

Inflationary pressures had remained contained across all major regions. ", " In China, some indicators of economic conditions had softened a little. Members were briefed that the Chinese authorities had scope to ease policy if needed to support GDP growth. In the property market, conditions had continued to soften and the government had announced policy changes designed to support the market. After discussing the potential impact of these changes on the housing cycle in China, members noted that the flow of overall non-bank financing had eased further, possibly reflecting recent additional regulatory measures aimed at limiting this type of finance. They also noted that the authorities' target for employment growth in 2014 as a whole was already close to being achieved. ", " In Japan, economic activity appeared to have picked up only a little following the decline in the June quarter, which had been due to the effect of the increase in the consumption tax earlier in the year. Overall, prospects for growth remained unclear, even though labour market conditions had been relatively tight, with average labour earnings having increased a little over the past year. Members observed that growth in output in the rest of east Asia had been a bit below its decade average in recent quarters. East Asian trade had grown steadily and remained relatively stable as a share of world trade. ", " The US economy looked to have been growing at around, or even a little above, trend, with business investment picking up noticeably and labour market conditions improving further. The unemployment rate had continued to decline, reflecting solid growth in payrolls in recent months, though members noted the low participation rate and relatively elevated measures of underemployment. ", " In the euro area, there had been little change in output in recent months and inflation remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). In response, the ECB had announced further stimulatory measures at its September meeting. ", " Members noted that iron ore prices had declined further over the past month, reaching their lowest level since September 2009. The decline over the past year had reflected a combination of increased Australian and global supply and, more recently, some softening in the growth of Chinese demand for steel, perhaps resulting in part from weaker conditions in the housing market. Members observed that most Australian iron ore production remained profitable at these lower prices and that increased pressures on global higher-cost mines would be expected, in time, to lead to reductions in their production. The prices of other commodities had declined a little over the past month in SDR terms, but were little changed in Australian dollar terms given the depreciation of the exchange rate. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The June quarter national accounts had been released the day after the September Board meeting. The accounts showed an increase in real GDP of 0.5 per cent in the quarter and a little more than 3 per cent over the year, in line with the forecasts published in the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. Members noted that a decline in resource exports in the June quarter had followed very strong growth in the previous two quarters, which meant that resource exports had made a significant contribution to year-ended growth. Consumption recorded moderate growth in the first half of 2014. Over the year to June 2014, consumption had grown faster than real disposable income, resulting in a further decline in the savings ratio. Growth in dwelling investment had been strong, whereas mining and non-mining business investment in aggregate had fallen over the year. ", " More recent data and liaison had suggested that moderate growth of consumption had continued into the September quarter. The two key measures of consumer sentiment had diverged, with one around average levels and the other still a bit below average. Members noted that consumption was also likely to be supported by the ongoing strength in the housing market. ", " Dwelling investment had increased by more than 8 per cent over the year to the June quarter, and continued strength in building approvals and other indicators pointed to further growth in coming quarters. House price growth had been a little slower, on average, over 2014 than in late 2013, but remained consistent with strong conditions in the established housing market. Over the previous six months, overall housing credit growth had been steady at around 7 per cent in annualised terms, but members noted that growth of investor credit had increased to close to 10 per cent. ", " Mining investment increased slightly in the June quarter, but was still expected to decline significantly over the course of 2014/15. Non-mining business investment was little changed over the year to the June quarter, but members noted that data from the capital expenditure survey indicated that this component of business investment was likely to increase moderately in 2014/15. Measures of business conditions and confidence had remained around, or a little above, their long-run averages. Information from liaison indicated that the cost and availability of finance did not appear to have been restraining business investment. ", " Members recognised that historically slow wage growth outcomes were consistent with spare capacity in the labour market. They also noted that the recent labour force data had been quite volatile, suggesting the possibility of some measurement problems. The unemployment rate in August had retraced the sharp rise recorded in July to be close to 6 per cent, around the average of the monthly unemployment rate over the year to date. Employment had reportedly increased substantially in August, driven by an exceptionally strong rise in part-time employment. Looking at a broader range of data, members concluded that labour market conditions remained subdued, although they appeared to have stabilised somewhat over the course of 2014 to date. Forward-looking indicators had picked up a little, but still pointed to only modest employment growth over the coming months. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members opened their discussion of financial markets with the observation that central banks were the main focus of attention in September and volatility had picked up a little from very low levels, predominantly in currency markets. ", " The US Federal Reserve had maintained its guidance in September that the federal funds rate was likely to remain unchanged for a ‘considerable time’ and thereafter rise only gradually. There were small upward shifts to Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' projections for the federal funds rate for 2015, with individual members' projections continuing to diverge substantially. ", " In contrast, the ECB had unexpectedly reduced by a further 10 basis points both its policy rate, to 5 basis points, and its deposit rate, to -20 basis points, in September. The ECB had also announced that from October it would purchase ‘simple and transparent’ euro area asset-backed securities, including residential mortgage-backed securities, and covered bonds. While no explicit target was set, the ECB's intention appears to be to expand its balance sheet back to its crisis peak, which would be around 1 trillion euros larger than at present, through a combination of targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and asset purchases. The ECB conducted the first of the TLTROs during September, with the take-up being lower than expected. ", " The decisions of the FOMC and the ECB were followed by sizeable movements in exchange rates, with the US dollar appreciating across the board, including against the Australian dollar. While an appreciation of the US dollar had been anticipated for some time, the exact timing of the appreciation was difficult to explain. The appreciation was associated with an increase in volatility in the main currency pairs, albeit only back towards typical levels. The euro had depreciated by 9 per cent since early May to be at its lowest level against the US dollar in two years, while emerging market currencies had generally depreciated against the US dollar as well. The notable exception was the Chinese renminbi (RMB), which had been little changed against the US dollar and had appreciated in trade-weighted terms by 5 per cent over the preceding year. ", " Members noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated by 4 per cent in trade-weighted terms over September. This was primarily a 6 per cent depreciation against a rising US dollar (and the RMB), although weaker-than-expected Chinese economic data and further declines in key commodity prices had contributed to some additional softening of the Australian dollar. The recent depreciation followed a period when the Australian dollar had held up against the US dollar more than most other currencies, and meant that the Australian dollar was now around its January low against the US dollar but remained a little higher on a trade-weighted basis than earlier in the year. ", " Members observed that US sovereign bond yields had fluctuated over September, with German, UK and Australian bond yields generally tracking the moves in US yields. ", " Share prices in the developed economies had declined over the past month, with the exception of Japan, where share prices had risen strongly in conjunction with a sizeable depreciation of the yen. Australian share prices had underperformed equity markets in other developed economies in September; concerns about the pace of economic growth in China and falls in commodity prices had adversely affected the share prices of domestic resource companies, and the share prices of banks had also weakened. ", " Members concluded their discussion of financial markets by observing that lending rates in Australia continued to edge down marginally in September. Financial markets continued to expect that the cash rate would be unchanged at the October meeting and over the following 12 months. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Growth in the global economy was continuing at a moderate pace. Commodity prices, in particular iron ore prices, had declined over the past month. This was consistent with both the ongoing increase in iron ore supply and further weakening of the Chinese property market, which is an important source of demand for steel. Global financial conditions remained very accommodative and the Australian dollar had depreciated somewhat, largely reflecting a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. ", " As expected, the domestic economy had grown moderately in the June quarter, following a strong March quarter result. The outcome was supported by strong growth in dwelling investment and steady consumption growth. Members noted that more timely indicators suggested that moderate growth overall had continued into the September quarter. ", " Faced with volatility in the labour force survey results, members based their assessment of the labour market on a range of indicators. These suggested that conditions in the labour market remained subdued but had stabilised somewhat this year. While forward-looking indicators pointed to modest employment growth in the months ahead, there was a degree of spare capacity in the labour market and it would probably be some time before the unemployment rate declined consistently. Wage growth was expected to remain relatively slow in the near term, which should help to maintain inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate. ", " Members noted that the current setting of monetary policy was accommodative, with lending rates remaining very low and continuing to edge lower over recent months as competition to lend had increased. In this context, members discussed the importance of lenders maintaining strong lending standards and the ongoing dialogue between the Bank and APRA on the matter. ", " Continued accommodative monetary policy was expected to support demand and help growth to strengthen over time. To date, this had been most apparent in the housing market, where dwelling investment had picked up and was expected to remain strong following the rapid rise in housing prices and high levels of approvals. Credit growth had remained moderate overall, but in recent months there had been a further pick-up in lending to investors in housing. Despite the easing in financial conditions associated with the depreciation of the Australian dollar, the exchange rate remained high by historical standards – particularly given recent declines in key commodity prices – and was offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy. ", " Given the information available, the Board's judgement was that the current stance of monetary policy continued to be appropriate for fostering sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target over the period ahead.

Despite declining a little over 2014, the unemployment rate remained high and inflation continued to be well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB) of close to, but below, 2 per cent. ", " Commodity prices overall had declined slightly over the past month. An ongoing expansion in global supply and easing of growth in Chinese steel production had put further downward pressure on iron ore prices of late, while rising oil supplies – particularly from the United States – had led to a sharp fall in oil prices. Members observed that this would support output growth in energy-importing economies. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" At the start of their review of the domestic economy and the economic outlook, members noted that the data available for the September quarter indicated that activity had grown a little below average, with the composition of growth remaining similar to that seen in the first half of 2014. ", " Resource exports had continued to grow strongly in the September quarter and were expected to be boosted over the next year or so by a further expansion in iron ore production, despite much lower prices, and a gradual ramping up of production of liquefied natural gas. Coal production was expected to be sustained at a high level even though a few smaller, higher-cost mines had closed in response to lower coal prices. Mining investment was expected to continue to decline for some time, with current projects being completed and only a few new projects under consideration. ", " Low interest rates and ongoing population growth were expected to continue to support growth in both housing activity and the established housing market. Growth in dwelling investment had remained strong and this was expected to continue in coming quarters, based on building approvals and other forward-looking indicators. Housing price growth had slowed from the rapid pace of late last year, but was still high in Sydney and Melbourne. While growth in housing credit for owner-occupiers was only a little above that of income, credit extended to investors had continued to grow at a noticeably faster rate. ", " Members noted that the strength in the housing market was expected to give some support to household consumption in the near term as rising housing valuations allowed some credit-constrained home owners to bring forward their consumption. The pick-up in retail sales in the September quarter and stronger growth in retail sales in those states with more rapid housing price growth was consistent with this view. However, members also observed that expectations of low income growth would be likely to weigh somewhat on consumption, which was expected to continue growing at a moderate pace in the near term before strengthening over 2016. ", " Survey measures of business confidence and conditions, along with measures of capacity utilisation, had been close to or above average long-run levels. However, non-mining business investment had remained subdued and liaison continued to suggest reluctance on the part of firms to undertake significant new investment projects until they experienced a sustained improvement in demand. Notwithstanding a substantial pipeline of non-residential building work yet to be done, non-residential building approvals had declined over the past year. Fiscal consolidation at all levels of government was also expected to weigh on aggregate growth in the period ahead. ", " The forces underpinning the outlook for domestic activity were much as they had been for some time. Mining investment was expected to decline sharply and resource exports were expected to grow strongly as the transition from the investment to the production phase of the mining boom continued. Members noted that non-mining business investment was not being impeded by the price and availability of finance. Overall, the forecast for output had not materially changed. GDP growth was still expected to be below trend over 2014/15, before gradually picking up to an above-trend pace towards the end of 2016. ", " Conditions in the labour market had remained subdued, with members noting that the latest vintage of the labour force survey data, which was released by the ABS during the meeting, showed a small rise in the unemployment rate over the previous six months and employment growth somewhat below the pace of population growth. Forward-looking indicators were at levels consistent with modest employment growth in coming months. ", " Inflation had declined in the September quarter, after earlier strong results. The year-ended rate of consumer price inflation declined to 2.3 per cent from 3.0 per cent previously. While acknowledging that the removal of the price on carbon had been an important factor behind lower CPI inflation in the September quarter, members noted that the effect on underlying inflation, which had declined to ½ per cent in the quarter and 2½ per cent over the past year, was much smaller. ", " Members observed that the fall recorded in tradables inflation in the September quarter had been a little surprising, given that it had been increasing in year-ended terms over the previous year, reflecting the depreciation of the exchange rate over the preceding 18 months or so. But they also noted that tradables inflation was quite volatile on a quarterly basis and that some of the most recent fall could be attributed to discounting of clothing and footwear prices to clear winter stocks built up during the period of unusually warm winter weather. Non-tradables inflation over the past year remained below its average over recent years and was little changed from the June quarter, abstracting from the effect of the repeal of the carbon price on utility prices. It was clear that lower wage growth had flowed through to the prices of many services, especially market services, while inflation in new dwelling costs had increased, consistent with the strength of activity in the housing market. ", " The outlook for inflation had been revised up slightly in response to the depreciation of the exchange rate during October. The cumulative effect of the exchange rate depreciation since early 2013 was expected to add a little under ½ percentage point to underlying inflation in each year over the forecast period. Nevertheless, domestic inflationary pressures were generally expected to remain subdued given spare capacity in labour and product markets. As a result, underlying inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the forecast period. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members observed that volatility in global financial markets had increased through October, with market positioning and dynamics amplifying the effect of increased investor concern about the outlook for global growth. ", " As expected, the US Federal Reserve ended its asset purchase program at its October meeting. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet stood at US$4.5 trillion, having increased by US$1.7 trillion during the third round of quantitative easing. Market pricing implied that the first increase in the federal funds rate would occur around October 2015, even though recent commentary by FOMC members suggested that mid 2015 was the most likely period when official rates would start to be increased. In contrast, market pricing suggested that expectations for future policy rate increases by the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had been pushed further out over the course of the past month. ", " The Bank of Japan (BoJ) surprised financial markets late in October with its announcement of a further easing in monetary policy. Japanese equity prices in particular had risen strongly following the announcement, in which the BoJ had outlined plans to make additional asset purchases to increase the money base further, with monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds and other assets expected to be around US$60 billion. Members noted that this compared with a previous peak in monthly asset purchases by the Federal Reserve of around US$85 billion. The BoJ had stressed that the present move had been pre-emptive and sought to ensure that the previous modest rise in inflation expectations in the Japanese economy did not dissipate. At the same time, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) announced a reduction in its target allocation for domestic bonds, together with significant increases in the corresponding target allocations to domestic and foreign equities and foreign bonds. Members noted the potential for these policy actions to increase the size of capital outflows from Japan in pursuit of more attractive yields on various assets in Australia (along with other destinations). Such flows could hold the Australian dollar at a higher level than economic fundamentals would imply. ", " The ECB commenced its covered bond purchase program in October. Members noted that after declining over the past couple of years by around €1 trillion, the ECB's balance sheet was subsequently expected to increase to around its earlier peak, through the ECB undertaking a combination of asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations. Italian and Spanish banks remained the largest borrowers of funds from the ECB – accounting for around two-thirds of outstanding lending. Members noted that the ECB's assessment of the asset quality of the euro area banking system had been released during the month. ", " US sovereign bond yields fell a little further over October, notwithstanding considerable variation within the month. On 15 October, yields traded over the widest intraday range (37 basis points) since 2011, as leveraged participants in this market unwound positions in other financial instruments. Australian bond yields also declined over the past month, generally tracking the moves in US Treasuries. ", " Share prices in the advanced economies fell sharply early in October, reflecting concerns about global growth, but had generally recovered those losses by the end of the month, with share prices in both the United States and Japan reaching multi-year highs. Members noted that Japanese equity prices had risen by  nearly 5 per cent on the last day of October in response to the unexpected further easing in the BoJ's monetary policy. Australian equity prices had also risen over the past month, outperforming most other markets, with stocks in the finance sector rebounding in particular. ", " The major movement in foreign exchange markets had been the depreciation of the Japanese yen following the policy announcement by the BoJ and the announcement by GPIF. Other exchange rates had been little changed, with the notable exception of the Russian rouble, which depreciated by a further 9 per cent against the US dollar over the month to be more than 20 per cent below its recent peak in late June. While the Russian central bank had undertaken significant intervention to limit the exchange rate depreciation, its foreign currency reserves remained sizeable. ", " After having depreciated noticeably in September, the Australian dollar was little changed against the US dollar in October. The Australian dollar had appreciated by 4 per cent against the Japanese yen, which has a 13 per cent weight in the trade-weighted basket. In trade-weighted terms, the Australian dollar ended the month higher than in January 2014, notwithstanding the significant declines in key commodity prices since then. ", " Members concluded their discussion of financial markets with the observation that Australian lending rates on the stock of outstanding housing and business loans were continuing to edge lower, while domestic financial markets expected the Board to leave the cash rate unchanged at the November meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The outlook for the global economy had been little changed, with the growth of Australia's major trading partners forecast to be a little above average in 2014 and 2015. While members judged that the risks for the global economy were roughly balanced, they acknowledged that there was considerable uncertainty related to the outlook for the Chinese property market and the broader implications for the Chinese economy. Commodity prices had declined noticeably over the year to date, although they remained high in historical terms. ", " Domestically, economic activity over recent months appeared to have continued growing at a moderate pace. The forces underpinning the outlook for domestic activity were much as they had been for some time and the forecasts had not materially changed; GDP growth was still expected to be below trend over 2014/15, before gradually picking up to an above-trend pace towards the end of 2016. ", " Very low interest rates continued to support activity in the housing market and this was expected to spur activity in other areas of the economy through the usual channels. Members noted that growth in housing credit extended to investors in housing had continued to grow at a noticeably faster rate than credit to owner-occupiers. ", " Labour market conditions had remained subdued and it was likely to be some time before unemployment declined consistently. Spare capacity in labour and product markets was likely to continue to limit domestic inflationary pressures, ensuring that the inflation outlook remained consistent with the target notwithstanding some temporary upward pressure from the depreciation of the exchange rate since early in 2013. Despite the recent depreciation of the exchange rate, the Australian dollar remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the further declines in key commodity prices over the course of the year to date. As a result, the exchange rate was offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy. ", " In their assessment and given the information available, the Board judged that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy continued to be appropriate to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target over the period ahead. Members considered that the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

The focus was initially on Ireland but it subsequently spread to Portugal, Spain, Italy and Belgium. Bond spreads in those countries widened to their highest levels since the inception of the euro. ", " Members were briefed on the support package for Ireland from the European Union and the IMF. A significant part of the package was earmarked to support the Irish banking system, which is very large relative to the size of the economy. Members discussed the causes of the current situation in Ireland, which included a leveraged residential and commercial property boom, and the very rapid growth in the Irish banking sector. Among other risks, they noted that the Irish banking system had become highly dependent on borrowing from the European Central Bank (ECB). ", " The contagion from Ireland that had spread to other parts of Europe reflected the financial inter-linkages in the form of interbank exposures, as well as the European sovereign debt holdings of the European banking system. Credit spreads in interbank funding markets had increased to their levels around the time of the Greek crisis in May, though they were still well below the peaks at the time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Members noted that the cost of funding the large US dollar asset positions held by European banks had also been rising. ", " Bond purchases by the ECB had resulted in euro area spreads declining in the days prior to the Board meeting, although some markets were very illiquid. Notwithstanding this decline, members noted that the level of bond yields in several peripheral euro area countries remained high relative to expected growth rates of nominal GDP. ", " Credit spreads outside Europe had not been particularly affected and bond issuance in the United States had continued apace, particularly for non-financial companies. Spreads on highly rated corporate bonds in the United States had been steady in recent months, while spreads on lower-rated bonds had narrowed. ", " Activity in the domestic securitisation market picked up during the month, including a large issue without support from the Australian Office of Financial Management. ", " Members noted the US Federal Reserve's decision to ease policy through further large-scale asset purchases. Speeches by FOMC members subsequent to the Fed's decision and better-than-expected US data had seen the market pare back its expectations of further policy measures by the Fed. This had contributed to a rise in government bond yields in the major markets over the past month. Financial market volatility had picked up as liquidity declined towards the end of the year. Illustrating the diverse economic fortunes at present, members noted that the authorities in China, India, South Korea and Thailand all tightened policy over the month. ", " Global equity prices had recovered to around the peak reached in April, but prices of financial stocks remained well below that level. Chinese equity prices had fallen as concerns grew about the prospect of further policy tightening in China. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the initial reaction to the Fed's policy announcement early in November was some further depreciation of the US dollar, but more recently the US dollar had experienced sharp moves in both directions. The euro had depreciated significantly against the US dollar over the past month. In the early part of November, the Australian dollar reached a new post-float high against the US dollar. Since then, reflecting the decline in risk appetite, the Australian dollar had depreciated against the US dollar, but it had appreciated against the euro to a new high. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar was around 2 per cent higher over the past month. ", " Members noted that mortgage rates had increased by more than the increase in the cash rate following the November meeting, such that mortgage rates were now slightly above their average since 1996. Currently, the market did not expect any change in monetary policy for the next few months. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members discussed how the financial turmoil in Europe could affect economic growth in that region. They noted that, for the euro area as a whole, the economic data continued to suggest moderate growth, though the differences across countries were large. Germany continued to outperform, with consumer and business confidence, and conditions in the labour market, considerably stronger than in the other European economies. ", " In China, attention was increasingly turning to the upside risks to inflation. Over the past year, the CPI was up by 4½ per cent, with food prices up by around 10 per cent. The authorities had responded by increasing the reserve requirements on banks and had announced a number of administrative measures to control price increases, but real interest rates remained low. The recent economic data continued to show robust growth in industrial production, investment and consumption, and there were some signs that merchandise exports were increasing again, after having fallen in earlier months. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, the recent data had been mixed. The Japanese economy had recorded robust growth in the September quarter, though this was mainly driven by stimulus measures that had changed the timing of expenditure. More recent data in Japan had been quite soft, with most monthly indicators showing weakness in October. A number of other economies in the region had recorded declines in GDP in the September quarter, after large increases over the previous year. Industrial production and exports had been weak in the quarter, though the trade data for October suggested a significant pick-up in exports. Domestic demand looked to be growing solidly in most economies in the region. ", " Growth in the Indian economy remained strong, with GDP increasing by 10½ per cent over the year to the September quarter. Growth had been broad-based across sectors, with agriculture, manufacturing and services all expanding strongly over the year. ", " In the United States, the recent data had, on balance, been a little better than in earlier months. Most of the data for the labour market had suggested some improvement, though overall jobs growth in November had fallen short of expectations. Members observed that recent indicators of business investment, business conditions and household spending suggested that the economy was continuing to expand, albeit at a modest pace. The recent indicators for the housing sector, however, showed few signs of improvement. The household saving rate was well above the levels of the middle of the decade. ", " Reflecting the increased uncertainties about the global economy, base metals prices were lower over recent weeks. In contrast, the price of gold had risen. There had also been significant increases in the spot prices of the steel-making commodities, namely iron ore and coking coal, which were around 25 per cent and 10 per cent respectively above the December quarter contract prices, pointing to increases in contract prices for the March quarter. This was a stronger outcome than the staff had been expecting, and suggested upside risks to forecasts for the terms of trade and nominal income. The severity of the impact of the recent heavy rains in Queensland on coal production remained to be seen. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" In the recent national accounts, GDP was estimated to have increased by 0.2 per cent in the September quarter and by 2.7 per cent over the year. Nominal GDP was up by 1.2 per cent in the quarter and 9.6 per cent over the year, boosted by the rising terms of trade, which had reached a new peak in the September quarter. Indeed, over the past decade, a significant part of the growth in real incomes had come from the terms of trade, with growth in standard productivity measures having slowed significantly relative to the 1990s. ", " The quarterly GDP outcome was a little softer than had been expected at the time of the November <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. While the pick-up in business investment was proceeding in line with the forecasts, consumption growth had been weaker, as had dwelling investment. Overall, the expected rebalancing of growth from public to private demand looked to be occurring, though public demand remained strong. The accounts confirmed that conditions varied considerably across sectors, with manufacturing output having been flat over the first three quarters of 2010, in contrast to solid rises in output in the mining sector and of some professional services. ", " Other information received since the November meeting had been consistent with a strengthening in investment. Capital expenditure in the resources sector was estimated to have increased strongly in the September quarter, and investment intentions for 2010/11 continued to be very high. Members noted that there had also been further announcements confirming that several large resources projects were moving ahead. In contrast, outside the resources sector capital expenditure was broadly flat in the September quarter, and the outlook was considerably more subdued than for resources. There were still few signs that commercial construction was picking up. Business credit had fallen again in October, though broader measures of financing had been unchanged, and there was further tentative evidence that the availability of bank financing was easing for borrowers outside of the commercial property sector. ", " Spending and borrowing by the household sector remained subdued, with substantially revised estimates suggesting that the saving rate had returned to its level of the mid 1980s. While the Bank's liaison continued to suggest modest growth, there was a surprisingly large fall in the ABS estimate of retail spending in October. Retailers continued to report that households were cautious in their spending and significant discounting remained widespread. Measures of consumer confidence had fallen somewhat after the increases in interest rates in early November, though confidence was still at an above-average level. Members observed that the restraint being shown by households, and the pick-up in the saving rate, would help reduce the medium-term risk from household balance sheets after a long period when debt ratios had risen, and would help to make room for the expected increase in investment. ", " Household credit had grown at only a modest pace for several months. The established housing market had cooled, with house prices tracking broadly sideways since June. Auction clearance rates had recently fallen noticeably. In terms of housing construction, there was an increase in building approvals in October, following declines over previous months, though the rate of construction was still low. ", " In the labour market, conditions remained firm. Employment was estimated to have increased by a further 30,000 in October, and the participation rate had risen to its highest level on record, with the unemployment rate increasing to 5.4 per cent. Members discussed developments in the participation rate, including the upward trend in participation by workers in the 45–54 and over-55 year age groups. Employment intentions generally remained solid. ", " The wage price index for the September quarter confirmed that wage growth in the economy had picked up from the slow pace of last year. The outcome in the quarter had been boosted by the earlier decision on minimum wages; abstracting from this, wages looked to be growing at around their average pace over the past decade. Members noted that some pick-up in wage growth was likely in the period ahead. Nonetheless, overall price pressures remained relatively modest at present, reflecting discounting activity and exchange rate effects, and measures of inflation expectations remained consistent with the medium-term inflation target. Members discussed the outcome of the CPI review by the ABS. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that the deterioration in the situation in Europe over the past month had increased the downside risks to the global economy. How this would ultimately play out, and the implications for Australia, were difficult to predict. It was possible that conditions could settle down, as they had after the episode of financial instability in May. Alternatively, an escalation of the current problems was not out of the question. If this prompted a fresh retreat from risk-taking in global financial markets, it would probably have more impact on Australia than any trade effect. ", " Developments in other parts of the world had been more positive. The US economy was growing at a modest pace. Recent data suggested that the Chinese and Indian economies were growing more strongly than expected, and prices for bulk commodities had strengthened over the past month. ", " Domestically, the Board's assessment of the central medium-term scenario was little changed from that made at earlier meetings. Employment growth remained strong and the expected pick-up in private investment looked to be broadly on track. Household consumption and borrowing, however, remained restrained despite high levels of confidence, and the saving rate had increased noticeably over the past few years. This restraint, if it continued, would provide some scope for investment to rise without causing aggregate demand to grow too quickly and inflationary pressures to build. ", " Following the Board's decision in November to lift the cash rate and the subsequent increases in lending rates, and taking into account the level of the exchange rate, monetary policy was judged to be mildly restrictive. Given the very high level of the terms of trade and the positive outlook for business investment, this policy setting was regarded as appropriate.

Over recent months, growth of retail sales and industrial production had been steady while the more timely PMIs had picked up. Growth in real estate investment had declined recently, consistent with softer conditions in the property market, whereas growth in infrastructure investment had increased somewhat. The authorities had eased reserve requirements a little for banks that lend mainly to the rural sector and small businesses. ", " Prices for steel in China, and the spot price of iron ore, were little changed over June, although the price of iron ore was about 30 per cent lower than earlier in 2014, reflecting increases in supply as well as a softening in the growth of demand for Chinese steel. Members observed that most mines in Australia (and Brazil) producing iron ore for export to China had lower variable costs of production than mines in China and other countries. Overall, other commodity prices were also little changed over the past month, but had fallen significantly since the start of the year. ", " Economic activity in Japan fell sharply in April, as had been expected given the sizeable run-up in spending ahead of the consumption tax increase in early April. Since then, there had been a pick-up in a number of indicators of activity. The rate of core inflation fell back in May after a large increase in April owing to the rise in the consumption tax rate. Members noted that while much of the higher rate of inflation over the past year had resulted from the depreciation of the yen, indicators pointed to demand growth running ahead of the growth of productive capacity and some tightening in the labour market. In the rest of east Asia, recent indicators were consistent with a slight pick-up in the pace of growth in the June quarter. Growth remained relatively subdued in India. ", " Recent data suggested that the US economy had grown at a moderate pace over recent months, after contracting in the first quarter. The labour market had strengthened further, with payrolls rising strongly in May and the unemployment rate noticeably lower than it had been earlier in the year. There were also some signs that consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat over recent months, although growth of wages had remained relatively modest. ", " Economic activity in the euro area appeared to have continued to expand at a modest pace in the June quarter. The unemployment rate had recorded a slight decline since the start of the year, but unemployment remained high and inflation continued to be well below the 2 per cent target. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The national accounts data showed that the economy grew at an above-average pace in the March quarter, driven by very strong growth in resource exports. GDP increased by 1.1 per cent in the quarter and by 3.5 per cent  over the year. With the sharp rise in resource exports reflecting capacity expansions and unseasonably favourable weather conditions, resource exports were not expected to grow as quickly in coming quarters. Excluding resource exports, GDP growth had still picked up but was less than 2 per cent over the year. Mining investment had declined noticeably to be around 15 per cent below its peak in late 2012, and further substantial falls were anticipated over coming quarters. Growth in public demand was weak and was expected to remain so over the next couple of years, in line with planned fiscal consolidation by federal and state governments. ", " Labour market conditions had improved a little since late in the preceding year. The level of employment was around 0.9 per cent higher since then. The unemployment rate had been steady at 5.8 per cent for the third consecutive month, although the participation rate had declined over that period. Employment growth in household services continued to be strong over the past six months, while employment in business services had also picked up. Members observed, however, that total hours worked had not increased for a considerable time. Forward-looking indicators of employment had recently been mixed and while these indicators were higher than at the low points of the previous year, they remained at levels consistent with only moderate growth in employment in the months ahead. ", " The recent national accounts data indicated that unit labour costs were little changed over the past year, reflecting low growth of wages and above-average growth of productivity. Members noted that while labour productivity had been boosted by a sharp improvement in the mining sector, productivity growth had improved across a wide range of industries in recent years. Business surveys and liaison suggested that wage growth was likely to remain subdued for some time, consistent with the modest improvement in the labour market to date. ", " There was a sharp fall in mining investment in the March quarter, while non-mining business investment increased a little. The high level of non-residential construction work yet to be done would support growth over the coming quarters, but non-residential building approvals had declined in recent months. Measures of business sentiment remained at around average levels, with the federal budget having had little discernible effect. Growth in intermediated business finance had increased somewhat over the past few quarters. ", " Household consumption growth had been a little slower in the March quarter than had been suggested by the retail sales data. In April, retail sales values were reported to have increased slightly and the Bank's liaison contacts indicated that retail sales were little changed over the May to June period. After falling sharply in May around the time of the federal budget, measures of consumer sentiment stabilised at below-average levels in June. ", " Dwelling investment increased noticeably in the March quarter and, over the six months to March, was running at close to the fastest pace seen in around a decade. Residential building approvals had declined somewhat in recent months, but they remained at relatively high levels and both work yet to be done and loan approvals for new dwellings pointed to further strong growth in dwelling investment in coming quarters. At the same time, there had been signs of a tempering in conditions in the established housing market. Members observed that, looking through the monthly volatility, housing price inflation had slowed over recent months, auction clearance rates had fallen from the high levels seen late last year, and loan approvals had been little changed over the past six months. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion of financial markets with the observation that markets continued to be characterised by low volatility. The main news over the past month had been the announcement by the European Central Bank (ECB) of a widely anticipated package of stimulatory policy measures that sought to address the risk of a prolonged period of low inflation in the euro area. The package comprised three main elements: ", " While these measures generally had little impact on financial markets, an exception was the expected path of the ECB's policy rate, which had shifted down further. The policy rate was now expected to remain below 0.50 per cent for more than three years. Members noted that the ECB had indicated that it would continue preparatory work to enable it to undertake outright purchases of asset-backed securities if required. The ECB had also reaffirmed its commitment to further unconventional policy measures – including large-scale, broad-based asset purchases – if the latest measures failed to boost inflation towards the 2 per cent target. ", " Members contrasted these measures with the actions taken by the US Federal Reserve at its June meeting, when it again reduced its asset purchases by a further US$10 billion to US$35 billion per month, down from a peak of US$85 billion per month in 2013. The Fed remained on track to cease asset purchases later this year, with markets expecting the first increase in the federal funds rate around the middle of next year. Members also noted that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had raised its policy interest rate for the third time in the current cycle in response to a strengthening economy, while market expectations of the first increase in the Bank of England's policy rate had shifted forward to the end of this year. ", " In response to generally better-than-expected economic data, government bond yields in the United States had increased a little in June, largely reversing the decline in the previous month. In contrast, yields on German bonds had fallen towards their historic lows during June. Members noted that Japanese purchases of foreign bonds continued to rise in June, with earlier more detailed data showing solid purchases of US and Australian bonds. Yields on Australian government bonds had declined over the past month, while the spread to US government bonds had declined towards 1 per cent, which was around its narrowest level since mid 2007. Borrowing costs for Australian state governments continued to fall to historic lows. ", " Members observed that government bond yields in a number of emerging markets had not changed much over the past month, although bond yields in Argentina had been volatile following the earlier decision by a US court to force Argentina to honour obligations to ‘holdout’ creditors who continued to hold bonds on which Argentina had defaulted more than a decade earlier. Members also noted that the manner in which these Argentine claims would be resolved over the next few months had the potential to affect future efforts to restructure sovereign debts in other markets. ", " Prices in the major equity markets were up a little in June, supported by the announcement of the ECB policy measures and slightly stronger data for the US economy. While heightened concerns about the situation in Iraq and Ukraine had weighed on markets, historically low volatility remained a feature of the major equity markets. In contrast, Australian equity prices had underperformed those in other developed markets, with declines in iron ore prices over recent months leading to falls in share prices in the resources sector. Nonetheless, members noted that equity prices in Australia rose by 12½ per cent over the year to the end of June 2014. ", " Conditions in foreign exchange markets had remained very subdued, with little change in the major exchange rates and volatility declining further to multi-decade lows in the past month. The Australian dollar had appreciated by around 2 per cent over the past month on a trade-weighted basis, which took its appreciation since late January to 8 per cent notwithstanding noticeable declines in bulk commodity prices over the same period. Members noted that other currencies such as the Canadian and New Zealand dollars had experienced similar movements and that the most surprising development was the continued low level of the US dollar, as well as the resilience of the euro. ", " Members were briefed that the marginal and average cost of wholesale debt of the major banks continued to decline. In turn, this had led to a decline in spreads on term deposit ‘specials’ relative to equivalent term swap rates. ", " In Australia, market expectations of future cash rates were little changed over the past month and the cash rate was currently expected to remain unchanged for at least the next 12 months. ", " Members concluded their discussion with a brief review of the large increase in the Reserve Bank's balance sheet over 2013/14, which had been driven by three main factors, namely an increase in exchange settlement balances held by authorised deposit-taking institutions with the Reserve Bank to facilitate faster payments, a rise in deposits held by the Australian Government, and the government grant to the Reserve Bank in May 2014. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Overall, global economic conditions were little changed over the past month and were consistent with growth in Australia's major trading partners remaining close to the average of the past decade. Commodity prices had also been steady, but were well below levels seen earlier this year, the more so in Australian dollar terms given the appreciation of the exchange rate since then. Financial conditions globally remained very accommodative. ", " In Australia, GDP growth was above trend in the March quarter and over the past year, reflecting very strong growth in resource exports from new capacity coming on line. Resource exports were expected to continue to expand in coming quarters, but not at such a rapid pace. There had been a gradual improvement in the pace of activity in the non-resource sector and forward-looking indicators suggested that further strong growth in residential construction was in prospect, despite some easing of conditions in the established housing market over recent months. After picking up through last year, household consumption growth appeared to have eased, while non-mining business investment was picking up gradually. ", " Conditions in the labour market had improved a little since earlier in the year, although forward-looking indicators had been mixed of late and consistent with only moderate growth in employment. The national accounts data confirmed that wage growth had been relatively low, which was consistent with the spare capacity in the labour market. ", " At its recent meetings, the Board judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. Low interest rates were working to support demand, but members agreed that it was difficult to judge the extent to which this would offset the anticipated substantial decline in mining investment and the effect of planned fiscal consolidation. The exchange rate remained high by historical standards, particularly given the declines in key commodity prices, and was therefore offering less assistance than it otherwise might in achieving balanced growth in the economy. ", " With growth in resource exports expected to ease back, GDP growth was forecast to be a little below trend over the next year or so, before picking up gradually thereafter. Inflation was expected to remain within the target. Accordingly, with the significant degree of monetary stimulus already in place to support economic activity, the Board judged that, on present indications, the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

That slowing largely reflected a contraction in Japan's output after the consumption tax increase in April, partly offset by stronger growth in China and the United States. ", " In China, GDP growth in the June quarter was consistent with the authorities' target for growth of 7.5 per cent in 2014 as a whole. The recent improvement in growth was driven by a rebound in exports and a pick-up in investment growth, which partly reflected the effect of modest stimulus measures. Conditions in Chinese residential property markets had weakened further, particularly in the larger cities, as many local government restrictions on property transactions implemented prior to 2014 remained in place. ", " In Japan, temporary fiscal stimulus measures had been introduced to counter the contractionary effects of the consumption tax increase, but the underlying pace of growth remained uncertain. Members observed that labour market conditions had tightened considerably over the past year, although wages growth had remained modest. Growth in the rest of east Asia appeared to have slowed over the first half of 2014 from the strong pace recorded in late 2013. Monetary policies in the region generally remained expansionary, but had been tightened a little in some countries, partly in response to a modest pick-up in core inflation. ", " The US economy grew strongly in the June quarter after adverse weather had contributed to weakness earlier in the year. Investment was stronger in the June quarter and consumption growth had picked up to around the pace seen through 2013. The labour market continued to strengthen and inflation had picked up a little over recent months, while the pace of recovery in the housing market had slowed. ", " Members noted that the gradual recovery of economic activity in the euro area appeared to be continuing, although unemployment remained high and inflation was well below the target set by the European Central Bank (ECB). ", " Prices for bulk commodities had declined over recent months, much of which owed to an increase in the supply of these commodities from lower-cost mines. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the inflation outcome for the June quarter had been a little higher than expected. Underlying inflation was around ¾ per cent in the quarter and 2¾ per cent over the year, while year-ended CPI inflation was a little higher, at 3 per cent. Much of the increase in CPI inflation over the past year reflected a pick-up in tradables inflation, which was consistent with pass-through of the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. This was comparable to that in previous episodes. Prices of consumer durables had declined less rapidly over the past year than in recent years, which was consistent with the effects of the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. ", " Non-tradables inflation had remained subdued at just over 3 per cent, its slowest pace in over a decade. The decline in non-tradables inflation since 2013 was most evident in lower growth of prices for market services. This was consistent with the slowing in growth of labour costs, which reflected both lower wages growth and higher productivity growth. Meanwhile, inflation in the cost of new dwellings had increased over the past 18 months or so, reflecting increased demand for residential construction. The prices of ‘administered’ items – those with regulated prices or for which the public sector is a significant provider – had also continued to increase at well above the pace of the overall CPI. Members discussed some of the forces underpinning the relatively strong growth in these prices. ", " A number of labour market indicators had improved a little since the beginning of 2014. Employment growth had broadly matched population growth and the unemployment and participation rates both remained steady in trend terms. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand had generally improved, but pointed to only modest employment growth in the near term. A notable degree of spare capacity in the labour market was suggested by the relatively high unemployment rate and the participation rate being close to its lowest rate in almost a decade. ", " Turning to household consumption, members noted that the volume of retail sales declined in the June quarter, in part reflecting the unusually warm weather at the start of winter. There had been a marked decline in consumer sentiment since earlier in the year, although a more timely weekly measure of sentiment had rebounded to be at above-average levels in recent weeks. ", " Members observed that residential dwelling approvals had declined somewhat in recent months, but remained at a high level and, in combination with the substantial amount of residential work yet to be done, suggested that dwelling investment was likely to remain strong in the period ahead. Conditions in the established housing market also remained strong and while house price inflation across the country in 2014 had not been as rapid as over the second half of 2013, it had remained robust. Auction clearance rates in Sydney had eased from their high levels in late 2013, although they had increased in Melbourne more recently. Factors influencing the demand for and supply of housing at present were also noted. ", " Measures of business conditions had remained at around average levels. Survey measures of investment intentions had also been around average, after picking up from the lower levels seen in 2013. Members noted that information from liaison continued to indicate that firms were reluctant to undertake significant investment projects until they experienced a sustained period of strong demand. While non-residential building approvals had declined in trend terms since early 2014, the stock of work yet to be done was expected to support the current level of non-residential construction in coming quarters. ", " The volume of exports was estimated to have declined in the June quarter, after increasing strongly in the preceding quarter as a result of strong growth in resource exports. The growth of iron ore and coal exports had been expected to moderate from the rapid pace seen in recent years, as capacity was forecast to expand at a slower rate over coming quarters. While construction of large projects to expand LNG capacity was proceeding, production was not expected to begin increasing noticeably until 2015. ", " Members noted that staff forecasts for domestic GDP growth were not materially different from those presented three months earlier. Growth was expected to be below average over 2014/15 before increasing to an above-average pace by 2016. Growth in non-mining activity had been expected to increase a little further, having already picked up over the past year, partly as a result of the support provided by the very low level of interest rates. Resource exports were forecast to add substantially to growth over the next few years. However, mining investment was expected to decline more rapidly than it had to date, and ongoing fiscal consolidation and the effects of the still high level of the exchange rate were expected to restrain growth. Members considered the implications for the forecasts of the usual assumptions that the cash rate and the exchange rate remained at their current levels and noted that the no-change assumption for the cash rate was consistent with market expectations over the near term. Members also noted the significant uncertainties around the growth forecast and the importance of considering the risks to the forecast as well as the central projection. ", " Overall, underlying inflation was expected to be consistent with the target over the forecast period. Domestic inflationary pressures were likely to remain subdued, reflecting spare capacity in labour and product markets. Working in the other direction, the decline in the exchange rate since early 2013 had pushed up import prices and these higher prices ‘across the docks’ were being passed through to prices facing consumers. The recent abolition of the carbon price would push inflation lower in 2014/15 than earlier assumed. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members observed that conditions in financial markets continued to be characterised by low volatility, notwithstanding the heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the ongoing uncertainty about the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate in the United States. Volatility in foreign exchange markets remained particularly low, and it was only in mid July that the S&amp;P 500 index for the United States ended the longest period of daily movements of less than 1 per cent in nearly two decades. ", " As expected, the Federal Reserve reduced its asset purchases to US$25 billion a month at its July meeting and reiterated its intention to reduce them by a further US$10 billion at its September meeting. Members noted that the Fed's plan is to end these purchases altogether in October, as long as the economy progresses as expected, and that markets expect the first rise in the federal funds rate will take place in mid 2015. Over the past month, the ECB released further details on its targeted long-term refinancing operations announced in June. In addition, it announced that from 2015 the frequency of monetary policy meetings will change from a monthly to a six-week cycle and the ECB will start publishing the minutes of its monetary policy meetings. ", " Members noted that yields on long-term US government bonds were unchanged over July, while Australian bond yields had declined in response to domestic developments, with the 10-year spread between the two bonds reaching its lowest level since 2006. Yields on 10-year German Bunds moved lower over the past month – reaching an all-time low of 1.12 per cent – while spreads between yields on Portuguese government bonds and Bunds had widened because of the difficulties experienced by Banco Espírito Santo, Portugal's largest bank by total assets. ", " Developments in many emerging market sovereign bond markets had been uneventful over the past month. However, yields had moved significantly higher in Russia, as sanctions were imposed, as well as in Argentina, which had defaulted on its restructured debt after a New York court ruled that it could not make payments unless it also paid ‘holdout’ creditors that had refused to accept the restructuring of bonds after the 2001 default. ", " Equity prices in the major markets had generally been little changed over the past month, with ongoing low volatility, although share price indices in the US markets had reached another high in late July before falling back subsequently. The Australian market had also reached its highest level since 2008 in July, driven in particular by rises in share prices of the large resource companies. ", " Members noted that large legal settlements with banks in the United States and some significant fines in the United Kingdom had brought the total value of fines imposed on major US and European banks thus far in 2014 to more than US$35 billion. ", " Conditions in foreign exchange markets continued to be quiet over the past month, with little change in major exchange rates in July and volatility remaining around historic lows. The US dollar recorded a modest appreciation while the euro depreciated by 2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The Australian dollar also depreciated slightly against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, although it remained well above its level in late January notwithstanding lower commodity prices and a narrowing in interest rate differentials between Australia and most other advanced economies since then. ", " Members noted that Australian banks had issued new bonds at around the same level as maturities, resulting in little net issuance in recent months. Secondary market spreads of the major banks' senior unsecured bonds to Commonwealth Government Securities had remained at their lowest levels since 2007, which was gradually reducing the banks' average cost of financing as more expensive bonds matured. The low cost of wholesale financing, combined with an easing in competition in the deposit market, had contributed to a decline in banks' deposit rates in recent months. ", " Average lending rates on housing and business loans in Australia continued to edge down over July, mainly owing to the ongoing replacement of more expensive fixed-rate and discount variable-rate loans from previous years. Overall, cumulative movements in interest rates since the start of the year amounted to a noticeable easing in financial conditions. Financial markets continued to expect the Bank to leave the cash rate target unchanged at the August meeting and over the year ahead. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Growth in Australia's major trading partners was expected to be a little above average in both 2014 and 2015. Commodity prices remained high, although iron ore and coal prices had declined following a substantial increase in the supply of these commodities. Global financial conditions were accommodative, with long-term interest rates and risk spreads remaining at low levels and volatility in financial prices declining further. ", " Domestically, GDP growth had been above average in the March quarter because of strong growth in resource exports and a pick-up in non-mining activity. On current indications, resource exports appeared to have been little changed in the June quarter and mining investment continued to fall. Public spending was scheduled to be subdued and the pace of consumption was likely to have remained around the moderate pace recorded in the March quarter. Meanwhile, the recovery in dwelling investment had gathered pace and conditions in the established housing market remained strong. Indicators of investment intentions in the non-mining sector were showing signs of improvement since the latter part of 2013, although liaison suggested that businesses were reluctant to commit to major new investment projects until they perceived a sustained pick-up in demand. Overall, GDP growth was likely to have slowed to a more moderate pace in the June quarter and was expected to be below trend over 2014/15, before picking up thereafter. ", " While there had been some modest improvement in indicators of labour demand over the course of the year to date, it was likely to be some time before unemployment declined consistently. This suggested that wage growth was likely to remain subdued, which should keep inflation consistent with the target in the medium term. Factors that had led inflation to be higher than expected over the past year, including the extent of pass-through to prices of the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate, were expected to ease over the forecast period. ", " Members noted that the current setting of monetary policy in Australia remained accommodative and supportive of demand. Credit growth had picked up a little and dwelling prices had continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than was the case a year earlier. Interest rates were very low and had declined a little further since the last reduction in the cash rate. On the other hand, the exchange rate remained high by historical standards, particularly given the notable decline in the prices of some key commodities, and hence was offering less assistance than it might in achieving balanced growth in the economy. ", " Staff forecasts suggested that inflation, despite recent higher readings, was likely to be consistent with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> target over the next two years. Output growth would probably be somewhat softer in the near term after recent higher readings, but was expected gradually to strengthen again over the forecast period. Members noted that there was inevitably a significant degree of uncertainty about the outlook, given the number of forces working in different directions. The Board judged that monetary policy was appropriately configured and that, on present indications, the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

Overall, however, conditions across the Asian region, including in China and Japan, had been weaker than expected this year. Growth in the United States and the recovery in the euro area had continued. Core inflation had generally edged higher in both the advanced and emerging economies, but remained below most central banks' targets. Globally, monetary conditions remained very accommodative. ", " Commodity prices, notably those for iron ore and base metals, had declined further over the previous month, consistent with ongoing indications that growth in global industrial production and trade volumes had remained subdued. There had also been a significant decline in oil prices following a further increase in oil production. Weak investment growth across the major economic regions may have partly explained the relatively subdued growth in world merchandise exports over the previous few years or so. ", " Conditions in the manufacturing and construction sectors in China had remained subdued and the output of many industrial products remained below levels recorded in 2014. There was overcapacity in some parts of the Chinese economy and conditions were likely to become more difficult over time for a range of unprofitable firms in these sectors. Export and import volumes were lower than they had been in 2014, although iron ore imports from Australia appeared to have been steady over 2015. Residential property prices overall had increased a little in recent months, but the stock of unsold housing was substantial in many cities and real estate investment had remained weak. This implied that it could be some time before there was a pick-up in construction activity. In contrast, the rate of retail sales growth had been maintained over 2015. Nonetheless, consumer price inflation had remained low and producer prices had fallen at a faster rate recently, which was consistent with spare productive capacity in the industrial sector and lower commodity prices. In recent months, the Chinese authorities had eased monetary policy further and growth in government expenditure had increased. These policy actions were expected to provide further support for economic activity. ", " GDP in Japan had contracted for two consecutive quarters. Despite that, labour market conditions had remained tight and nominal wage growth had picked up over the past year. Core inflation had continued to edge higher, but remained below the Bank of Japan's 2 per cent target. In the rest of east Asia, GDP growth picked up in the September quarter after a soft June quarter outcome. Members noted that this stronger growth could reflect temporary factors and that weak external demand was likely to have negative effects on many economies in the region for some time. India was acknowledged to be a notable exception; domestic demand had continued to grow strongly and inflation had been contained at around 5 per cent, which was a little below the Reserve Bank of India's target. ", " Recent data confirmed that GDP in the United States had grown at a slightly slower pace in the September quarter, following strong growth in the previous quarter, although domestic demand had continued to grow at an above-average rate. There had been a further improvement in labour market conditions, including some signs that wage growth had picked up a little more recently, while unit labour costs (namely, wages adjusted for productivity) had grown at a rate over the past year that was close to their long-run average. Members noted, however, that core inflation had remained stable at a rate below the Federal Reserve's target. ", " The recovery in the euro area economy had continued, aided by further growth in consumption. The unemployment rate had declined further, although there was still significant spare capacity in much of the region. Core inflation was a little higher than it had been earlier in the year, but still well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the September quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. GDP growth looked to have picked up in the quarter, but was likely to have remained below average over the year. Resource exports and dwelling investment were expected to have made positive contributions to growth in the September quarter, following declines in the June quarter. Based on partial indicators, household consumption growth was likely to have increased in the September quarter but business investment was expected to have declined. ", " Growth in retail sales volumes had been a bit below average in the September quarter. Information from liaison contacts suggested that retail conditions had been more favourable recently and a range of other indicators pointed to some strengthening in the pace of household consumption growth since the middle of the year. Measures of consumer sentiment showed that perceptions of personal finances relative to a year earlier had been above average, consistent with low interest rates, lower oil prices and stronger employment growth. Motor vehicle sales to households had been on a steeper upward trend since the beginning of 2015. ", " The available data suggested that dwelling investment had increased in the September quarter. Building approvals remained at high levels, despite having eased somewhat since the start of the year. This was consistent with the expectation of further increases in dwelling investment in coming quarters, albeit at a gradually declining rate. ", " In the established housing market, auction clearance rates and housing price growth had declined over recent months in Sydney and to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Prices were declining in Perth and rising moderately in much of the rest of the country. Members observed that the growth of total housing credit had been little changed. The easing in housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne and apparently lower growth in lending for the purpose of investor housing had followed an earlier tightening in lending terms, partly in response to supervisory measures announced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. It was still too early to assess the effect of the modest increase in lenders' mortgage rates in November (for both investors and owner-occupiers) on the housing market. ", " Mining investment was estimated to have fallen in the September quarter and further declines were expected in the period ahead, with the largest subtraction from growth expected to occur in the current financial year. Non-mining investment was estimated to have been little changed over the year to the September quarter. Investment intentions reported in the ABS capital expenditure survey – which covers only around half of non-mining investment – continued to point to a decline in non-mining investment in 2015/16, and non-residential building approvals had remained at relatively low levels. In contrast, survey measures of business conditions continued to improve and were clearly above average, in particular for the household services and business services sectors, whose output was generally less capital intensive than other sectors. Business credit had increased further in October. ", " Conditions in the non-mining sector had also been supported by further growth in net service exports, consistent with the depreciation of the exchange rate. Resource exports had rebounded in the September quarter, following earlier disruptions to bulk commodity exports owing to unfavourable weather and unanticipated shutdowns of some liquefied natural gas facilities. ", " Employment growth had been strong in October and the unemployment rate had declined to 5.9 per cent, although in trend terms it remained in the 6–6¼ per cent range it had been in since the middle of 2014. Members observed that unemployment rates for most states were in the range of 5½–6½ per cent. Measures of job vacancies and advertisements pointed to continued growth in employment over the coming months. Wage inflation had remained subdued in the September quarter, consistent with spare capacity in the labour market and the forecast for a prolonged period of weak wage growth. The latest data suggested that wage growth had been little changed in the household services sector, where employment growth had been strongest. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members' discussion of financial markets commenced with Australian developments. Although questions remained over the quality of housing credit data disaggregated by the categories of investors and owner-occupiers, there were signs that lending for housing to investors had eased and lending to owner-occupiers had picked up a little. Significant reclassifications of loans to investors to loans to owner-occupiers in recent months, reversing some of the reclassifications earlier in the year, made determining the current rate of growth of the two categories difficult. Most mid-sized housing lenders in Australia had increased their standard variable lending rates by 15–20 basis points in November, despite not being subject to the same capital increases on housing loans as the major banks. Overall, by the end of November, housing loan rates for owner-occupiers had risen to their levels around the middle of the year, while those for investors had risen by more, to be back to their levels at the beginning of the year. Members noted that strong competition in the banking sector meant that business lending rates had remained at historic lows for both small and large businesses. ", " Yields on money market instruments in Australia at the end of November implied only a small probability of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting. ", " Internationally, the divergent outlooks for monetary policy in the United States and Europe continued to be the main driver of financial market developments. In the United States, market expectations of a rise in the federal funds rate in December had increased over the past month following stronger-than-expected labour force data, such that pricing implied at least a three-in-four chance of a rate rise at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. In Europe, further stimulus was thought likely at the ECB's next policy meeting in December. In Japan, expectations remained that further stimulus would be provided by the Bank of Japan, even though that had not been signalled at the most recent policy meetings. ", " The differing expectations for monetary policy in the major economies had been reflected in higher US Treasury yields over the past month and German short-end yields declining to a historically low level of −0.4 per cent. Members noted that around half of outstanding German sovereign bonds were trading with negative yields, as was a significant share of other European sovereigns. ", " The differing outlooks for monetary policies among the major jurisdictions were also apparent in exchange rates, with the US dollar appreciating over the past month while the euro and yen had both depreciated. The Chinese renminbi had been little changed against the US dollar. Members noted that the International Monetary Fund had approved the inclusion of the renminbi in the Special Drawing Right currency basket from 1 October 2016. In contrast to most other currencies, the Australian dollar had appreciated against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the past month to be a little above its recent lows. ", " Global equity prices were little changed over November, but remained higher over the year. The Chinese market in particular had moved sharply in both directions, but showed little net change over the year to date. Australian equity prices had underperformed other developed equity markets over the course of 2015, weighed down by resources stocks, whose prices had fallen along with broad-based falls in commodity prices. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the available data suggested that the global economy continued to record moderate growth. Continued softness in demand growth in Asia had been associated with a further fall in commodity prices. At the same time, there had been further growth in the United States and a continued recovery in Europe. Monetary policy was accommodative in most economies, which, combined with the low level of oil prices, was expected to support growth in Australia's major trading partners over the next couple of years. Core inflation rates remained stable, but generally below central banks' targets. ", " Members noted that recent domestic data had generally been positive. There continued to be evidence that very low interest rates were supporting growth in household consumption and dwelling investment, and the exchange rate was adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices and boosting demand for domestic production. This had translated into stronger employment growth and was consistent with surveys suggesting that business conditions were above average. Resource exports had continued to make a significant contribution to growth. ", " Overall, the forecasts for the Australian economy were for output growth to strengthen gradually over the next two years as the drag on GDP growth from falling mining investment gradually diminished and activity progressively shifted to non-mining sectors of the economy. Business surveys suggested that there had been an improvement in conditions in non-mining sectors over the past year, which had been accompanied by stronger growth in employment and a steady rate of unemployment. Even so, members recognised that there was still evidence of spare capacity in the economy, including in the labour market. Wage growth remained low and underlying inflation was expected to be consistent with the target over the next one to two years. ", " Credit growth had increased a little over recent months, as a result of business credit growth increasing. Growth in lending to investors in the housing market appeared to have eased, with a moderation in the pace of growth in housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne over recent months. Housing price growth had mostly remained subdued in other cities. While the recent changes to some lending rates for housing would reduce demand slightly, overall conditions remained quite accommodative. Members observed that supervisory measures had been helping to contain risks that may arise from the housing market. ", " Based on the available data and the forecasts, the Board decided that leaving the cash rate unchanged at this meeting was appropriate. Members judged that the outlook for inflation may afford some scope for a further easing of monetary policy should that be appropriate to lend support to demand. The Board would continue to assess the outlook, and hence whether the current stance of policy would most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

The growth rates of industrial production and retail sales had remained fairly steady, while the growth of fixed asset investment had declined a little further. The manufacturing PMI for August had declined to around the average level of recent years. Conditions in the Chinese residential property market continued to weaken and members observed that these developments – and their potential to spill over to broader activity and the financial system – remained a risk to the outlook for China. They noted that there was scope for further adjustments to policy settings by the authorities if needed, as well as the potential for tension between the objectives of maintaining economic growth at close to its current pace and placing growth in financing on a more sustainable footing. ", " The modest easing of growth of Australia's trading partners in the June quarter had largely reflected the contraction of output in Japan, which had been expected following the consumption tax increase in April. Members noted that more timely measures of conditions had generally picked up a little, but it was too early to judge the likely pace of growth over the second half of this year. The economies of east Asia overall had been growing at around the rate of recent years, while the United States had recorded a strong rebound in growth in the June quarter. In contrast, economic activity in Europe remained weak, with real GDP in the euro area unchanged in the June quarter and the unemployment rate falling only gradually.

The price of iron ore had fallen to around its recent lows while coal prices were little changed, following sharp declines earlier in the year. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members began their discussion of the domestic economy by considering developments in the labour market. Overall, conditions remained subdued. The recorded unemployment rate increased to 6.4 per cent in July. This was concerning, though members noted that interpretation of this increase had been clouded by significant measurement issues and that other labour market indicators suggested conditions had not deteriorated to the extent implied by the increase in the unemployment rate. While employment growth had moderated somewhat in recent months, employment remained about 1 per cent higher over the past year and forward-looking indicators of labour demand had been improving modestly since late last year. Members noted that forecasts of a period of below-trend growth in economic activity meant that it would be some time before the unemployment rate declined consistently. ", " Members observed that the degree of spare capacity in the labour market was apparent in the slow growth of wages. The wage price index for the June quarter indicated that annual wage growth had remained around the slowest pace seen in the 17-year history of the series. Business surveys and information from liaison with firms suggested that wage growth in the private sector was likely to remain contained at around its recent pace over coming quarters. ", " Members noted that the June quarter national accounts were scheduled to be released the day after the meeting. GDP growth was expected to have slowed from the strong growth recorded in the March quarter, with export volumes declining following the very strong growth in the March quarter. Domestic demand was likely to have been supported by further growth in dwelling investment and moderate consumption growth. ", " A number of indicators – including retail sales and measures of consumer confidence – suggested that household consumption had increased moderately in the June quarter. More recently, the value of retail sales had picked up in the month of June and measures of consumer confidence had rebounded to around average levels. Information from liaison with firms suggested that the value of retail sales had increased over July and August. ", " Members noted that dwelling investment had expanded further in the June quarter and that leading indicators pointed to continued growth in the months ahead. For new dwellings, loan approvals and first home owner grants had increased strongly over the year and dwelling approvals remained at a high level despite having declined a little since late last year. At the same time, a wide range of indicators showed that conditions in the established housing market continued to strengthen. In particular, housing prices had been rising at a rapid pace and auction clearance rates were above average levels. Housing credit had continued to grow at an annualised pace of around 7 per cent, with investor credit a particularly strong component. ", " Recent data suggested that business investment had been little changed in the June quarter. For the non-mining sector, the ABS survey of firms' capital expenditure intentions had been revised slightly higher and continued to imply modest growth in non-mining business investment over the course of 2014/15. Members noted that survey measures of business conditions and confidence continued to improve across non-mining industries and were now above their average levels. While mining investment was estimated to have been little changed in the June quarter, it was expected to decline significantly over the next year or so, consistent with what had been indicated for some time by liaison contacts. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial markets with the observation that conditions remained similar to the previous month. Markets continued to be characterised by low volatility despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about the timing of the first interest rate increase in the United States. ", " The ECB left policy rates unchanged at its August meeting and planned to conduct its first targeted longer-term refinancing operation later in September, which was expected to see the ECB balance sheet expand again. ", " Major sovereign bond yields fell over the month, with yields on 10-year German Bunds falling below 1 per cent for the first time on record and yields on two-year bonds again falling to below zero. Members noted that the recent fall in yields on Bunds had reflected a fall in inflation expectations rather than in real yields, as had been the case previously. US 10-year bond yields declined to their lowest levels since mid 2013. ", " Yields on Australian government bonds also declined over the past month, as the falls recorded early in August after the release of the labour force data for July were only partially unwound following an improvement in measures of business and consumer confidence. ", " Global equity prices were generally little changed over the past month, although the US market had reached new highs. The Australian equity market had also shown little net change over the past month, with company earnings announcements broadly in line with expectations. ", " Conditions in foreign exchange markets, including for the Australian dollar, had remained quiet over August, with volatility remaining at low levels. ", " Members noted that Australian banks continued to raise funds relatively cheaply, with a recent issue of residential mortgage-backed securities being of record size in the domestic market and occurring at the tightest pricing since the financial crisis. Reflecting lower funding costs and competitive pressures, rates on Australian intermediaries' housing loans continued to edge down in August. The average interest rate on all outstanding housing loans had fallen by around 15 basis points since the cash rate was reduced in August 2013. ", " Members concluded their discussion of financial markets by noting that market pricing was for the cash rate to be unchanged at the September meeting and for the next year at least. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " Volatility in global financial markets remained low, as did the extra return that investors earned for bearing risk. Investors had been seeking higher yields in a range of markets. Members noted that a sudden change in risk assessment could lead to a sharp repricing of assets and could also disrupt the gradual improvement in conditions that had occurred in the major banking systems overseas. Potential triggers for such a reappraisal included revised expectations for the path of interest rates in advanced economies. In contrast, credit and geopolitical events over recent months that might have been expected to affect investor risk appetite had caused little reaction in market prices. ", " Large banks in most major economies had made progress in repairing their balance sheets, but this had been hampered by low profitability, which had resulted from weak economic conditions and, in some cases, fines for past misconduct. Asset performance remained especially weak in the euro area. In contrast, credit and property prices had been growing strongly in some emerging economies, including China until recently, which had made these economies more sensitive to adverse shocks. ", " Members noted that Australian banks continued to report improving asset performance and strong profits, which had contributed to further increases in their capital ratios. Australian banks and non-banks had both benefited from easier wholesale funding conditions globally. This in turn had encouraged stronger competition in lending for housing and to large businesses, but members noted that this had not, to date, led to a general easing in mortgage lending standards and policies. For investors in housing, the pick-up in housing credit growth had been more pronounced than for owner-occupiers, with investor demand particularly strong in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne. ", " Members further observed that additional speculative demand could amplify the property price cycle and increase the potential for property prices to fall later. The main risks in such a scenario would likely be to the stability of the macroeconomy rather than the financial system, particularly if households were to react to declines in their wealth by cutting back on their spending. Members were also updated on some of the recent actions by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in this area. ", " Members noted that commercial property markets in Australia had also been quite buoyant recently. Australian property had been yielding higher rental returns than were available overseas, which had attracted strong demand from both local and foreign investors. This had boosted prices even though rents for some types of commercial property had declined. In contrast, demand for finance from other parts of the business sector remained subdued, although business credit growth had picked up a little in recent months. ", " Members were briefed on recent international regulatory developments, as well as on the <em>Financial System Inquiry Interim Report</em> and the Bank's supplementary submission to the Inquiry. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The outlook for Australia's major trading partners was little changed from the previous meeting, with growth expected to be a little above average in both 2014 and 2015. Commodity prices remained at historically high levels, although iron ore prices had declined noticeably over the past month. Global financial conditions remained very accommodative, with long-term interest rates falling further over the month and volatility and risk spreads remaining at low levels. ", " Domestically, GDP growth was expected to have eased in the June quarter following the strong outturn in the March quarter. Exports had declined and although mining investment was expected to have been little changed in the June quarter, it was set to decline noticeably over the next year or so. At the same time, measures of business conditions had improved and there was evidence suggesting that growth in non-mining business investment would pick up modestly over the coming quarters. ", " Labour market conditions had remained subdued, with recent data indicating a degree of spare capacity. Wage growth had remained low and it was likely that it would be some time before the unemployment rate declined on a sustained basis. ", " Members noted that the current setting of monetary policy was accommodative. Interest rates remained very low and had declined a little for borrowers since the cash rate was last changed. Investors continued to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments and were accepting more risk in doing so. Credit growth had picked up, including to businesses. Credit growth for investor housing was running at around 10 per cent per annum. Housing prices were continuing to increase in the larger cities and members considered that the risks associated with this trend warranted ongoing close observation. On the other hand, the exchange rate remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the declines in key commodity prices and, overall, had offered less assistance to date than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy. ", " Accommodative monetary policy was supporting demand in some sectors of the economy, but policy also needed to be cognisant of the risks to future growth that could accompany a large further build-up in asset prices, particularly if that was associated with an increase in leverage. Members judged that the current stance of monetary policy continued to be appropriate and was contributing to sustainable growth and inflation outcomes consistent with the target over the period ahead. Members considered that the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

In China, growth in a range of key indicators had been running at a somewhat slower pace than over the course of 2013, with outcomes having been a little mixed of late. Growth in industrial production increased a touch in March and April, and PMIs picked up in May, while, in contrast, a range of other indicators, including various measures of freight, had shown more moderate growth than in 2013. The slower growth in residential investment was consistent with the broad-based decline in residential property inflation and transaction volumes over recent months. While there had been a number of reports that the extent of overbuilding had been greater in smaller cities, the decline in price inflation and downturn in sales were larger in the biggest cities, which had earlier experienced a more pronounced increase in prices and sales. ", " In Japan, GDP picked up sharply in the March quarter, driven in large part by a strong increase in consumption ahead of the rise in the consumption tax from the start of April, although business investment was also stronger. Preliminary indicators suggested that household expenditure fell back subsequently, as had been expected. In Thailand, GDP declined sharply in response to political unrest. In the rest of east Asia, GDP growth moderated slightly in the March quarter from the strong pace seen in the December quarter; taking the two quarters together, growth was around its longer-run average pace. More timely indicators suggested that this had continued over recent months. Members noted that economic conditions in India remained subdued but with potential for stronger growth if structural reforms were pursued. ", " Recent data suggested that the US economy was growing at a moderate pace. GDP recorded a small decline in the March quarter, in large part reflecting the unusually severe winter weather. More recent indicators had been stronger and forward-looking indicators of business investment pointed to further growth. ", " The gradual recovery in the euro area economy had continued through the year to date. Indicators of economic activity had improved of late and measures of household and business confidence were around their average levels. Business credit, however, had continued to decline, reflecting a combination of weak demand for, and constrained supply of, loans. Members noted that large corporations were raising funds through bond issuance but smaller businesses were not able to access this source of finance. ", " Iron ore prices fell further over the past month, in part reflecting softer conditions in the Chinese steel market but also in response to the increase in iron ore production capacity globally. Other commodity prices were little changed overall, with coal prices relatively stable, rural prices declining a little and base metals prices slightly higher. Members noted that at current prices most iron ore production in Australia was thought to be profitable, but that some iron ore producers in other countries were likely to have begun to incur losses. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The wage price index rose by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.6 per cent over the year. The year-ended pace of wage growth was 1 percentage point below its long-run average and around the slowest pace in the 17-year history of this series. Members noted that the decline in wage growth over the past 18 months or so was consistent with the increase in the unemployment rate over the same period. Business surveys and liaison suggested that wage pressures were likely to remain constrained over the year ahead. ", " The labour market had shown some signs of improvement. In April, employment increased to be almost 1 per cent higher since the end of 2013 and the unemployment rate remained steady. Forward-looking indicators had improved over the past year but remained at low levels, consistent with relatively moderate growth in employment over coming months. ", " The 2014/15 federal budget estimated that the deficit would narrow by slightly more over the next two years than estimated in the 2013/14 Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Members observed that the change in the budget position over the next couple of years was forecast to proceed at a similar rate to earlier episodes of fiscal consolidation. Beyond that horizon, the budget implied a more substantial fiscal consolidation than had earlier been projected. ", " Household consumption spending had continued to increase, with growth in the volume of retail sales in the March quarter around the same strong pace as in the December quarter. Following strong growth in January, growth of the nominal value of sales had slowed over the three months to April, and the Bank's retail liaison suggested that growth had moderated further in May. Measures of consumer sentiment had fallen sharply over the past month and were now below their long-run average levels. However, it was noted that while low-frequency movements in confidence measures had been broadly associated with trends in consumption spending, there was little evidence from the historical record that high-frequency movements carried much predictive content. ", " A range of indicators of housing construction confirmed that a significant recovery was underway. Residential work done picked up strongly in the March quarter. Forward-looking indicators of new dwelling investment were at high levels relative to recent years, although building approvals had declined in recent months. In the established housing market, dwelling price growth had eased from the rapid pace seen in 2013 and auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had declined from the high rates that prevailed during much of 2013. ", " Resource exports grew very strongly in the March quarter. Iron ore exports had continued to grow in April, while coal exports had declined somewhat. Private non-residential building approvals had continued to trend lower, although the high level of work yet to be done was likely to sustain construction activity for some time. The ABS capital expenditure survey for the March quarter suggested that mining investment fell in the quarter, while non-mining business investment appeared to have increased a little. Looking ahead, firms' investment intentions implied that mining investment would fall quite sharply over the course of 2014/15, but the same survey pointed to a modest increase in non-mining investment over this period. Surveys of business conditions and confidence in April remained around their long-run average levels. In the Bank's liaison, non-mining firms continued to report a reluctance to commit to significant new investment projects until they saw a sustained improvement in demand conditions. ", " Members noted that the March quarter national accounts were scheduled to be released the day after the Board meeting. GDP was expected to have grown at an above-average pace in the quarter, led by a large increase in resource exports. Dwelling investment had shown signs of improvement. Mining investment looked to have declined while growth in public spending was likely to have been subdued. "], "Financial Markets": [" With financial markets continuing to be characterised by markedly low volatility, the main focus over the past month had been the outlook for monetary policy set by the European Central Bank (ECB). At its meeting in early May, ECB President Draghi had emphasised that the ECB Governing Council was dissatisfied with the subdued outlook for inflation and would take action if necessary at its meeting in early June. Likely actions to be considered included a further reduction in policy rates – which would reduce the ECB deposit rate to below zero – as well as long-term refinancing operations aimed specifically at supporting small and medium-sized businesses. Over the past month, market expectations for the future path of the ECB policy rate had shifted down by around 10–20 basis points. ", " The US Federal Reserve was widely expected to continue reducing its asset purchases by US$10 billion at each policy meeting, until such purchases end later this year. Market expectations for the future federal funds rate had also declined modestly over the past month. ", " The decline in sovereign bond yields was another feature of financial market developments in May, with yields in the major markets around 60 basis points lower than at the start of the year. Reasons for lower yields cited by commentators included market expectations of lower long-term real rates worldwide and heightened demand for sovereign bonds from pension funds and banks. Members noted that most of the posited explanations had emerged after bond yields had actually declined. ", " Yields on longer-term government bonds in Australia had fallen by a similar amount to those in the major markets. The Australian Government's budget had little effect on financial markets, with sales of Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS) continuing to be well received. Interest rate spreads between CGS and state government debt had also remained at around their lowest levels since 2007, as had spreads on investment grade corporate bonds both in Australia and elsewhere. ", " Government bond yields in emerging markets had also declined further from their peaks earlier in the year. Election outcomes in India and Indonesia had had very little effect on yields in those countries, as did the imposition of martial law in Thailand. ", " Members noted that equity prices in advanced economies, including Australia, had increased slightly during May, while volatility in equity prices had remained very low. ", " Similarly, volatility in foreign exchange markets remained around multi-year lows during May, including for the Australian dollar, which was little changed over the month. ", " Business credit in Australia had recorded modest growth over the past year, with business credit extended by Japanese and Chinese banks operating in Australia rising considerably faster than the total. ", " Members noted that market expectations of the future path of the cash rate in Australia implied a considerable period of stability. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Global and domestic economic conditions overall were little changed from the previous meeting. Growth of Australia's major trading partners remained consistent with the earlier outlook, with growth early in 2014 around its long-run average. Based on data to hand, GDP growth in Australia in the March quarter appeared to have been a little above trend. Much of this reflected very strong growth of resource exports, which was not expected to be sustained at such rates in coming quarters. The expectation of substantial falls in mining investment, below-average growth of public demand and non-mining investment remaining subdued for a time implied that the pace of growth was likely to be a little below trend over the rest of this year and into the next, before gradually increasing. ", " Data for the labour market suggested that demand for labour had improved over the early part of the year. Members noted that this improvement may have in part reflected some ‘catch-up’ after a period of surprisingly weak employment growth in the previous year. Forward-looking indicators were higher than they had been, but still at levels consistent with only moderate employment growth in the months ahead. The spare capacity in the labour market was leading to low growth of wages, which was expected to persist for some time. ", " At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. Low interest rates were working to support demand, although it was difficult to judge the extent to which this would offset the expected substantial decline in mining investment and the effect of planned fiscal consolidation. Those uncertainties were likely to take some time to resolve. The earlier decline in the exchange rate was assisting in achieving balanced growth in the economy, but less so than previously as a result of its higher levels over the past few months. Members noted that the exchange rate remained high by historical standards, particularly given the further decline in commodity prices over the past month. ", " Notwithstanding a pick-up in growth around the turn of 2014, GDP growth was expected to be below trend over the next year or so, rising gradually thereafter. Inflation was forecast to remain within the target. Given this outlook for the economy and the significant degree of monetary stimulus already in place to support economic activity, the Board judged that the current accommodative stance of policy was likely to be appropriate for some time yet.

Overall, the recovery from the global recession was continuing. The IMF had recently upgraded its world growth forecast for 2010 to 3.9 per cent, from 3.1 per cent in October. There had been significant revisions for the United States, China and India, but more modest revisions for the euro area. The Bank's staff had also revised up their world growth forecasts for 2010, though only modestly as their forecasts had already been significantly higher than those of the IMF. ", " While growth had resumed in the major advanced economies, there was significant spare capacity and measures of core inflation were gradually falling. Labour markets were very weak, although there were some signs of stabilisation in the United States. US GDP had grown by 1.4 per cent in the December quarter, which was stronger than expected. There was a significant contribution from the inventory cycle. GDP data for the United Kingdom were also available, with the preliminary estimate showing growth of 0.1 per cent in the December quarter, after six straight declines. ", " Growth in the advanced economies was currently being supported by the inventory cycle and stimulatory policy settings. At the household level, there was growth in spending in the United States and Japan, but spending continued to contract in many European economies. Members discussed this trend, which reflected weak income growth and rising household saving rates in some of the larger European economies. The latter appeared to reflect weak consumer sentiment, broader uncertainty about economic prospects, and – in some economies – concern about high public debt levels. Regarding investment spending, there had been a slight increase in the United States in the December quarter, after a decline of more than 20 per cent over the previous five quarters. As yet, there was limited evidence of a pick-up in investment in the euro area or Japan. ", " Members noted that one particular challenge facing many of the advanced economies was the growth in public debt. From the point of view of long-run fiscal sustainability, this needed to be checked, but tightening fiscal policy at an early stage could undermine economic recovery. Concerns about fiscal issues had recently focused on Greece, which had entered the crisis with relatively high public debt and had seen its budget deficit rise to 13 per cent of GDP in 2009. ", " The issues were quite different in Asia (outside of Japan), where growth was significantly stronger and unemployment was falling in the higher-income economies. Chinese growth was estimated to have been around 2¼ per cent in the December quarter and 10¾ per cent over the year. There was evidence of some rebalancing in growth, with a fall in fixed-asset investment through the quarter after a sharp run-up earlier in the year. Export volumes had grown strongly over the past few quarters, with an even larger pick-up in imports. Elsewhere in east Asia, exports and industrial production had grown very strongly in late 2009. ", " While growth had picked up across most of Asia and core inflation had increased – albeit from low levels – financial conditions in many economies remained quite stimulatory. Authorities in a number of economies were taking steps to slow lending, including via increased reserve ratios on banks, a tightening of lending criteria such as maximum loan-to-value ratios, and – in China – directives to slow lending. Members noted that it was difficult to calibrate such measures. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" On balance, the domestic data in the two months since the previous meeting suggested a gradual strengthening in economic activity and a continuation of the slowing in underlying inflation. ", " The GDP data for the September quarter were difficult to read, and had indeed been reissued to correct some errors. While they suggested a slowing in growth to only 0.2 per cent in the September quarter, the trend data showed a gradual strengthening in growth through the first three quarters of 2009, which was more consistent with other data on the economy. Overall, the economy was estimated to have expanded by 1.5 per cent over the first three quarters. Board members noted some significant upward revisions to GDP growth over the year to the June quarter 2007, which made the employment and output data for that period more consistent. ", " Recent data on the labour market had been quite strong. Employment was estimated to have grown solidly in December, with 135,000 new jobs in the last four months of 2009. There had been a resumption of growth in full-time employment and also a pick-up in average hours worked. The unemployment rate had fallen to 5.5 per cent and it now appeared that the peak in the unemployment rate had been around 5¾ per cent. Board members noted that the decline in average hours during the slowdown was likely to have prevented a significantly larger increase in unemployment than actually occurred, and reflected the greater labour market flexibility that had resulted from labour market reforms over the past 25 years or so. ", " Board members discussed trends in the household sector. Consumer confidence was high, partly reflecting the improving labour market and continuing gains in household wealth. The ABS retail trade data were available only up to November. While these had been quite strong, a range of reports suggested that spending over December and January had been more mixed. Based on liaison and public reports, it appeared that sales through the early part of December had been weak, with some subsequent improvement. ", " The housing market remained fairly buoyant, with private-sector measures suggesting price growth of 10–12 per cent over 2009 and the ABS measure of prices of detached houses having risen by slightly more. Prices appeared to have levelled out in late 2009 in lower-priced suburbs, consistent with reduced demand following the winding back of the higher grants to first-home buyers. Loan approvals had declined in November and were estimated to have fallen further in December, perhaps indicating initial reactions to the tightening of policy. ", " Surveys suggested that business conditions remained firm, though the NAB survey, which became available during the meeting, suggested a significant fall in business confidence back to around average levels. Other survey data suggested that businesses remained fairly cautious in their spending plans. Nevertheless, even after the falls in investment spending over the past year, investment remained high as a share of GDP, and it was projected to increase further as investment in the resources sector picked up over coming years. Members again discussed developments in the flow of finance to the business sector, which remained weak. However, the weakness in bank lending had been partly offset by increased funding from the capital markets, and it appeared also to reflect the desire of some firms to reduce their leverage. Financing for the private construction sector remained weak. ", " The consumer price data for the December quarter had been in line with staff expectations. Underlying inflation was gradually declining, and was around 3¼ per cent on a year-ended basis and around 0.6 per cent in the quarter. The appreciation of the exchange rate in early 2009 had contributed to a decline in tradables prices in the quarter. Non-tradables inflation (excluding deposit and loan facilities) was well below the peak levels of 2008, but remained high relative to its average rate over the inflation-targeting period. Year-ended CPI inflation was 2.1 per cent, after a couple of quarters when it had been below 2 per cent. ", " Members were briefed on the revised staff forecasts, which were based on the assumption of a gradual rise in the cash rate over the forecast period. Year-ended GDP was forecast to strengthen through 2010 to a rate of 3¼–3½ per cent over the remainder of the forecast period. Growth in the mining sector was expected to be significantly stronger, partly reflecting the expected growth in the LNG sector and upward revisions to expected coal and iron ore prices. Growth outside of the resources sector was expected to be more subdued. Higher commodity prices meant that the forecast for the terms of trade in the coming year had been revised up significantly. ", " Year-ended underlying inflation was expected to decline further through 2010 to around or just below 2½ per cent, reflecting the earlier slowing in demand and wages and the appreciation of the exchange rate through 2009. Inflation was expected to pick up a little thereafter, to around 2¾ per cent by the end of the forecast period, as the expansion continued and the effects of the appreciation faded. "], "Financial Markets": [" Financial markets had generally consolidated over the previous two months, with the sources of tension shifting from banking systems to sovereign risk. ", " The turmoil over Dubai's debt problems, which had been discussed at the previous meeting, had quietened following support from Abu Dhabi. But more recently there had been heightened concern over Greek government debt, reflected in a significant increase in the spreads on this debt. Members discussed the challenges for Greece, as well as the problems of some other European economies with high debt ratios. They noted that spreads on Ireland's debt had narrowed following the announcement of significant cuts to public spending. ", " In the domestic bond market, demand for Commonwealth bonds was strong, while the Queensland Treasury Corporation had successfully completed a very large issue without making use of the Australian Government guarantee. Members noted that the cost of this issue was less than that of a guaranteed issue (including the guarantee fee). ", " Markets did not anticipate any increase in policy rates by major central banks until the third quarter of 2010 at the earliest, although Norway and Israel had raised policy rates again. However, most of the market liquidity support programs of the major central banks had generally been allowed to run down: the Federal Reserve had announced the cessation of many of its programs on 1 February, and asset purchases in the United States and United Kingdom were at, or nearing, completion. The Bank of Japan was the exception, having increased its provision of liquidity. In the rest of Asia, there had been policy tightening in some economies. ", " In Australia, bond issuance by banks in 2009 had been very large and at longer maturities. Members noted that financing needs in 2010 were likely to be significantly lower. There had been two large issues of government-guaranteed debt in December as banks responded to inquiries by investors, but most of the issuance in January had been unguaranteed. Unguaranteed issuance remained cheaper for the major banks, except at quite long maturities. Issuance of Kangaroo bonds (Australian dollar issues by offshore issuers) had been strong recently, taking advantage of the favourable cross-currency basis swap spread for such issuers. ", " Members noted that the signs of improvement in the domestic securitisation market discussed at the previous meeting had continued. There had been several large issues by Australian banks over the past two months. The AOFM had purchased only a small share, given the strong private-sector interest. ", " Global equity markets rose through December and early January, but had fallen in the week or two prior to the meeting. US bank earnings reports for the fourth quarter had been mixed, with banks' investment banking operations doing relatively well but their commercial banking arms continuing to report significant loan-loss provisions. ", " In the foreign exchange market, the US dollar had appreciated since the previous meeting, particularly against the euro. The Australian dollar had depreciated from its recent highs in the days prior to the meeting, but was still markedly higher than a year earlier. ", " Members discussed recent movements in lending and deposit rates. There had been significant variation in the size of changes to housing loan rates following the December cash rate increase; there was currently a wider-than-usual spread among the interest rates charged by different banks. On average, variable housing rates had risen by around 35 basis points. Borrowing costs for large businesses had risen by about the same amount, but lending rates for small businesses had mostly changed in line with the cash rate. Members noted that there was still strong competition for deposits. ", " Expectations for a rise in the cash rate at this meeting were quite high, though they had declined a little in recent days as a result of the increase in risk aversion in global markets. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that the information that had become available over the past two months was generally positive. Developments in the international economy and financial markets had mostly been consistent with a gradual improvement in conditions and forecasts for global growth were generally being revised upward, as were projections for Australia's terms of trade. Nevertheless, uncertainty remained over the likely pace of growth in the major economies once the effects of fiscal stimulus and the inventory cycle had abated. Concerns over sovereign debt issues had increased in the period leading up to the meeting, which might result in more cautious behaviour. Growth continued to be quite strong in Asia, and the Chinese and Indian authorities were starting to lessen the stimulus to their economies. ", " In the domestic economy, the labour market had strengthened materially but, on the other hand, reports about household spending in December and January had been quite mixed. There were some tentative signs that parts of the housing market were seeing the effect of the decline in assistance to first home-buyers and higher interest rates, though high-end housing values were continuing to increase. Overall, there had been a slight upward revision to the growth forecasts made at the time of the November 2009 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. ", " The latest prices data had shown that underlying inflation was falling in line with earlier forecasts, while headline CPI inflation had risen from low levels as the temporary factors that had been holding it down abated. Members noted that the forecasts were for further declines in the year-ended rate of underlying inflation, though the expected trough in inflation had been revised up slightly. Nonetheless, inflation would be consistent with the target over the next year or so and, conditional on the assumption of a gradual further increase in the cash rate, was forecast to remain so. ", " In considering the level of interest rates, members noted that the three increases in the cash rate late in 2009, together with the widening in the margins between the cash rate and many lending rates, had meant a material adjustment to the stance of monetary policy. Members judged that monetary conditions were no longer exceptionally accommodative, though the structure of interest rates was still somewhat below average. ", " As at the previous meeting, members considered the policy considerations to be finely balanced. Members expected that, if economic conditions continued to improve as expected, further increases in the cash rate were likely to be necessary. But they did not regard that outlook as requiring an increase at every meeting, and they saw the earlier moves to begin withdrawing monetary stimulus promptly as affording the Board a degree of flexibility in its subsequent decisions. This allowed the possibility of waiting to receive some more information on how the economy was responding to the monetary tightening that had already occurred. Such a course would also allow time to monitor events overseas. ", " Members noted that many market participants expected a further increase in the cash rate at this meeting. They concluded that, on balance, the stronger case was to leave the cash rate unchanged for the time being. This decision would be accompanied by communication that, if economic conditions evolved broadly as expected, further adjustments to policy would probably be needed over time to ensure that inflation remained consistent with the target over the medium term.

Overall, recent data confirmed that the global economy was recovering, though the pace of expansion varied significantly across countries and regions. Importantly, growth in Asia, the region that contained Australia's largest trading partners, was strong. ", " Data on the US economy had been mixed. Information on industrial production and the business surveys had tended to show some improvement. However, housing market data remained soft and construction spending was still declining amid sharp falls in commercial property prices, high vacancy rates and rising loan delinquency rates. While there had been some rise in private saving from earlier lows, there had been a much larger increase in public sector dis-saving. ", " Europe remained the weakest area in the global economy, with private demand quite soft but exports being boosted by demand from other regions. In Japan, GDP had registered solid growth in the December quarter, but the GDP data for the previous quarter had been revised down significantly. ", " There had been a relatively limited amount of new data for China. However, there was continuing evidence of strength in bank lending and asset markets, with property prices rising strongly in many cities. Elsewhere in Asia, industrial production and exports had been strong. Most Asian economies also had solid GDP outcomes in the December quarter, though there were some exceptions. Most prominent was India, where GDP growth was reported to have been slightly negative, reflecting a decline in agricultural production. ", " Members discussed issues surrounding high public debt levels in many advanced economies. These arose not only from the significant widening of fiscal deficits over the past two years, but also the poor starting points in terms of deficits and debt levels at the time of the onset of the global recession. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" A significant amount of data had become available since the previous meeting, including two months of data on both retail sales and building approvals, an additional month of data on employment, and various pieces of information feeding into the December quarter national accounts. Overall, these data had tended to be quite firm. ", " The staff estimate for the GDP figure to be released the day after the meeting was for growth in the December quarter to be ¾–1 per cent, which was a little higher than expected a month earlier. Public demand, especially public investment spending, was estimated to have been very strong in the quarter. Machinery and equipment spending had also grown strongly, partly reflecting the tax incentives that expired at the end of December 2009, and there had been continuing growth in household spending and export volumes. ", " Members discussed developments in the labour market, where there had been a further rise in employment and fall in the unemployment rate in January. Employment was estimated to have grown by around 190,000 over the five months to January and the unemployment rate had fallen by ½ percentage point from its earlier peak, although hours worked had not yet reversed earlier falls. It now appeared that the peak unemployment rate in the recent downturn had been equal to around the low point in the previous three cycles. Members again noted the benefits of a flexible labour market in limiting the number of jobs lost in the recent downturn. ", " Business surveys were generally showing that business conditions remained at fairly healthy levels. Surveys showed business confidence and hiring plans to be relatively high, but also suggested a degree of caution in many businesses' investment plans. This was consistent with the recent ABS Capital Expenditure Survey, which suggested that investment outside of the mining sector was expected to remain relatively subdued. In contrast, expectations for mining sector investment pointed to further increases from current already high levels. In addition, commodity prices were high and market expectations about contract prices for bulk commodities for the coming year had been revised upwards. Members discussed the prospects for the resources sector and noted that it was unlikely that all planned projects would proceed at the rate that firms hoped for, in part reflecting capacity constraints in that sector. Overall, the ratio of business investment to GDP was expected to be at very high levels in coming years. ", " Members noted that the contraction in business credit had slowed noticeably; the January data showed a decline of 0.1 per cent in the month, compared with declines of more than 1 per cent per month a few months earlier. Loan approvals had started to rise and the rate of repayments by firms was estimated to have begun to fall. More generally, banks were now reporting greater willingness to lend to businesses and there were fewer reports from firms of very tight credit conditions, while liaison indicated falls in risk margins paid by some borrowers. ", " The retail trade data had suggested relatively subdued sales in December but solid growth in January. Household surveys suggested that households were fairly confident overall about the future but (like businesses) were somewhat cautious in their views about spending. ", " The market for established housing had been very buoyant, with auction clearance rates at high levels, notably in Melbourne. Data for housing prices suggested that nationwide prices had continued to grow at a rate of close to 1 per cent per month in December and January. Building approvals in December and January were running at a relatively high level compared with the past year, but at a rate that was below the levels of previous peaks in home-building. Data for housing loan approvals had declined somewhat recently, consistent with what had occurred in previous episodes of monetary policy tightening. The recent falls were concentrated in approvals to owner-occupiers, with approvals to investors increasing, particularly in Victoria. ", " There had been no new data on consumer price inflation over the past month. However, the data for the wage price index for the December quarter indicated that growth in private-sector wages had remained quite low, while public-sector wage growth had remained firm. Overall, the staff still expected consumer price inflation to be around 2½ per cent over 2010. "], "Financial Markets": [" The discussion focused initially on the sovereign risk issues associated with Greece, which had resulted in heightened volatility in financial markets. ", " Spreads between Greek and German government debt had widened in recent months, following a number of years when they had been very low. Notwithstanding the rise in the spread, the overall interest rate faced by the Greek Government was not high, particularly when compared with similar crises in the past. ", " The near-term refinancing task for Greece was considerable. Members noted that Greece did not account for a large proportion of the global sovereign debt market; rather, the main risk was the possibility of contagion to other sovereigns and perhaps other markets, primarily in the euro area. ", " Yields in the major bond markets had been little changed over the past month, except in the case of the United Kingdom, where they had drifted up a little. The developments in Greece had initially led to a small rise in spreads on emerging market bond yields, but these had since narrowed again. European corporate bond spreads had been little affected. Australian government bond yields had been relatively steady over the past month. ", " The effect of the sovereign risk concerns on foreign exchange markets had been more marked. There had been a significant depreciation of the euro over the past two months, though on a trade-weighted basis the euro remained at a relatively high level. The pound sterling had also depreciated markedly over the past month. ", " The Australian dollar had remained unchanged in trade-weighted terms. Nonetheless, there had been significant movements in bilateral exchange rates: the Australian dollar had reached a 25-year high against the pound sterling and a multi-year high against the euro, but had depreciated against several Asian currencies, notably the yen. ", " The sovereign risk concerns had also weighed somewhat on global share markets, which had generally shown little movement over the past month despite some positive earnings reports from US companies. Members noted that fourth-quarter earnings reports by euro area and UK banks had been relatively poor. ", " In Australia, company profits for the second half of 2009 had been up strongly in headline terms relative to the corresponding period in 2008, owing to fewer asset write-downs. Underlying profits, however, had fallen by about 7 per cent. Profits of resources companies had fallen by nearly 30 per cent, but these had been mostly offset by rises in the financial sector. ", " Members noted the cessation of the Australian Government guarantee schemes for wholesale funding of authorised deposit-taking institutions and state governments. The announcement of this had little effect on interest rates on bank debt, though a scarcity premium on guaranteed issues saw spreads on guaranteed debt decline a little. The maturity profile of Australian guaranteed bank debt was reasonably well distributed and the refinancing task over the next couple of years was not particularly large. The major rating agencies had said that the withdrawal of the guarantee scheme had no immediate implications for credit ratings. ", " Spreads on debt of the Australian states to Commonwealth Government securities had continued to decline, and New South Wales and Queensland (the two states that had earlier taken up the guarantee) had recently completed some large unguaranteed issues. ", " There had been continued activity in the residential mortgage-backed securities market over the past month. Two more issues had occurred with some support from the Australian Office of Financial Management and a third was in train. Pricing had been consistent with earlier issues and both the recent issues had been upsized from their initial offering. ", " Turning to monetary policy in the major economies, members noted that market participants had pushed out their expectations of policy tightening to at least the end of this year. The Federal Reserve had raised the discount rate, but this did not signal any change to the current policy stance. Members were informed of the various measures that were under consideration by the Fed to deal with the challenge of tightening policy in an environment where its balance sheet remained unusually large. ", " China and India had tightened their monetary policy settings over the past month by raising reserve requirements on banks. To date, there had not been any policy interest rate increases in emerging market economies. ", " Members noted that interest rates on loans in Australia had been little changed over the past month. Market expectations were that an increase in the cash rate at this meeting was more likely than not. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. The main themes were that conditions in the US and European financial systems had improved significantly since the depths of the crisis but were still far from normal, while the Australian financial system had remained resilient. ", " Banks in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and the euro area were earning only modest profits in aggregate, though the position had improved from the sizeable losses posted in 2008. The pick-up in profitability had reflected several factors, including the one-off nature of earlier securities write-downs, increased income from investment banking activities and higher net interest income, which reflected steep yield curves in many countries. The main factor to watch in the period ahead would be bad-debt charges, which were likely to remain high for some time and could rise further. ", " Banks in Australia, Canada and Asia (excluding Japan) were doing considerably better than those in the United States and Europe. Their profitability had generally improved recently after holding up relatively well during the financial crisis. For the major banks in Australia, growth in net interest income had increased, and provisions for loan losses appeared to have peaked at levels that were low by international standards. Non-performing loans were disproportionately in commercial property lending, while impairment rates for housing loans remained low. ", " Australian banks and other authorised deposit-taking institutions remained well capitalised, reflecting ongoing profitability and recent equity raisings, and had increased their holdings of liquid assets. The global focus on strengthening the deposit bases of banks and higher liquidity standards had seen increased competition for deposits, resulting in sharp rises in interest rates on term deposit specials. ", " In discussing the exposures of the global banking sector to Greece, members noted that these were quite small both in absolute terms and, for countries with the largest banking sector claims on Greece, as a proportion of their total foreign claims. The exposure of Australian banks to European government debt more generally was minimal. ", " Members noted the ongoing debate on regulatory developments in various international fora. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In October 2009, the Board had come to the conclusion that the very stimulatory monetary policy that had been put in place to support the economy when the outlook had appeared much weaker was no longer necessary or appropriate. The Board therefore had started the process of moving the level of interest rates closer to normal. ", " The prompt start to that process had subsequently allowed some flexibility in the pace at which it proceeded. At the February meeting, the Board had taken advantage of that flexibility to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged, pending more information. ", " On balance, the data becoming available since then had given some further clarity about the strength and durability of the economic recovery that was under way. While economic conditions in the major western economies remained soft, economic growth in Asia was continuing to be strong. Domestically, most economic indicators continued to point to a strengthening in economic activity. Staff estimates suggested that the national accounts, to be released the next day, would show economic growth of ¾–1 per  cent in the December quarter. January data suggested that the labour market had continued to firm, consumption spending had held up reasonably well overall and a pick-up in dwelling activity was under way. Indications were that the mining sector would, on balance, provide a significant boost to the Australian economy over a number of years. Members noted that the staff forecasts showed that economic activity would grow at around trend rates over the next couple of years. Indeed, some recent indicators suggested that growth might already have been running at or close to trend for a few months. ", " At the same time, the moderation in private-sector wage growth in the most recent data supported the forecast that underlying inflation would fall further in the near term, to around 2½ per cent on a year-ended basis over the coming year. ", " Members took note of the positive developments in the financial sector, including early signs that credit to business was becoming easier after the difficult period last year. They also noted that, while housing loan approvals had slowed a little, house prices had gained significant momentum and were continuing to rise strongly for all but the bottom segment of the market. ", " Members agreed that the fiscal problems in Europe, if not resolved satisfactorily, could result in renewed turmoil in markets and fresh weakness in the global economy, which could have implications for Australia. But while such an outcome could not be ruled out, it was not the most likely one. The central expectation remained that the global expansion would continue at a reasonable pace with significant regional differences. Members concurred that the appropriate course was to set policy as required by the most likely outcome, and to be ready to respond to other outcomes if they eventuated. ", " On balance, members concluded that the evidence that had become available recently had confirmed that it remained appropriate for interest rates to move gradually towards normal levels, and that it was timely to take another step in that direction.

The recovery was still two-speed: growth was strong in the emerging and middle-income economies, particularly in Asia, but the expansion was less well-entrenched in some of the large advanced economies. Overall, Consensus forecasts suggested that global economic growth in 2010 would be around 4 per cent, which was about average. ", " In the United States, the housing sector remained weak and policy-makers faced significant fiscal challenges, but the labour market was gradually improving. It now appeared that the unemployment rate had peaked in late 2009, and private-sector employment had grown by an average of 65,000 jobs per month in February and March 2010. Although income growth and consumer confidence were still weak, household consumption spending had grown steadily for several months. ", " In China, data for January and February suggested robust growth in industrial production and fixed-asset investment. Members discussed the surge in investment in China in 2009, noting that it had been focused more on infrastructure than the manufacturing sector. Growth in industrial production and exports had been very strong elsewhere in east Asia. ", " The strong growth in Asia was contributing to some pick-up in core inflation in many countries in the region, most notably in India. Food inflation had also risen across Asia. Monetary policy in the region was still very accommodative, though central banks in India and Malaysia had announced increases of 0.25 percentage points in their policy rates in the period since the previous Board meeting. ", " Recent economic data for Japan had been relatively positive, easing concerns that had existed a few months ago that the recovery in that economy might be faltering. Information on the euro area, including significant upward revisions to monthly industrial production and retail sales data, also suggested some improvement. Nevertheless, spare capacity in both these economies and in the United States remained substantial. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The December quarter national accounts had been released the day after the March Board meeting. GDP growth was 0.9 per cent in the quarter, which was a little stronger than expected at the time of the February <cite>Statement                                       on Monetary Policy</cite>. With some upward revisions to earlier quarters, growth in 2009 was 2.7 per cent. GDP growth was supported by growth in public demand in 2009, with private spending quite subdued, but the staff forecasts envisaged a reversal in this pattern through 2010 and beyond. ", " Conditions in the labour market were continuing to improve. While employment was estimated to have been unchanged in February, it had risen by around 200,000 since August. Jobs growth since mid 2009 was evident in a range of industries, including professional services, mining and financial services, though employment in the retail sector had fallen. Business surveys indicated an increase in hiring intentions, and data for job vacancies had also shown an increase. ", " Household surveys suggested that consumer sentiment had remained at a high level in recent months, though consumers appeared quite cautious in their spending; there had been little growth in retail spending over recent months. ", " The business surveys suggested that business conditions and confidence were both at above-average levels. However, there was some variation across sectors, and some caution in spending plans outside the mining sector. The non-residential building sector remained subdued and, abstracting from the surge in construction of educational facilities, new approvals were at relatively low levels. ", " Spot prices for coal, iron ore and other resources had continued to rise over the past month. The price negotiations for iron ore indicated a fairly broad-based shift to price-setting on a quarterly, rather than annual, basis. Although spot iron ore prices were below the high levels seen in 2007 and early 2008, contract prices were expected to rise to new highs. Initial indications for contract prices for coal also pointed to large increases. The strength in coal and iron ore prices over recent years was partly a reflection of the very large increase in global steel production over the past decade, which in turn reflected the high steel intensity associated with growth of the Chinese economy. ", " Developments in commodity markets meant that the increase in the terms of trade through 2010 was likely to be substantially larger than forecast in the February <cite>Statement                                       on Monetary Policy</cite>. This implied strong growth in nominal incomes in the Australian economy over 2010. The increases in coal and iron ore prices, along with the developments in the LNG sector, were also contributing to a strong outlook for investment in the resources sector. Members noted that, while the Australian economy was benefiting significantly from developments in the resources sector, these would also pose challenges. ", " Information on the housing market suggested that conditions remained buoyant. Nationwide capital city price growth was running at around 1 per cent per month in early 2010, and auction clearance rates had remained high in March, especially in Melbourne. Members discussed the factors contributing to the recent strong price growth. On the demand side, population growth was strong, households had confidence about future income growth, and mortgage rates were at below-average levels. At the same time, the supply of new housing was not expanding sufficiently, partly because of the land usage policies of local and state governments and also because of the tightness of finance for developers. Members also noted that the current price growth was somewhat at odds with the falls in housing loan approvals over recent months. ", " Credit to the household sector had recently continued to grow at a moderate pace of around 0.7 per cent per month. The decline in business credit had slowed noticeably in early 2010, suggesting that the period of corporate deleveraging was coming to an end. This was consistent with information from liaison, which had pointed to a gradual easing in financing conditions for businesses. ", " There had been limited new data on inflation over the past month, but the March quarter CPI would be released prior to the next meeting. The various measures of inflation expectations were around or a little above their average levels over the inflation-targeting period. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members discussed developments regarding sovereign debt in the euro area. As at the time of the meeting, there had been some modest abatement in concerns over the situation in Greece following news that euro area leaders had agreed on an emergency funding package that would be available if required. However, details of the package were not clear and there could be an extended period of uncertainty in financial markets. ", " The easing in concerns over Greece and a general increase in risk appetite had been reflected in increases in global equity markets over the past month. Yields on government debt in the major economies had been little changed, with the exception of some pick-up in yields on US government bonds following stronger economic data. ", " In Australian markets, the Government guarantee for bank debt issuance had ceased at the end of March. There had been some use of the guarantee program in its final month, mostly by branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks. The major domestic banks had undertaken a solid amount of unguaranteed issuance. ", " The issuance of Kangaroo bonds (domestic issuance by non-residents in Australian dollars) in the March quarter had been the second highest on record. This had reflected a strong appetite for Australian dollar assets and a favourable cross-currency basis swap spread for foreign issuers. There had also been some further issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) over the past month. While three of the issues had some support from the Australian Office of Financial Management program, there had been strong private-sector demand. Members noted that RMBS spreads in the secondary market had continued to fall this year, helping to bolster investor appetite for new primary market issues. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had appreciated against the currencies of the major advanced economies, though it remained quite low in a longer-run perspective. Members noted the significant discussion during the month about the possibility that the Chinese authorities might soon allow some appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar. The Australian dollar had tended to appreciate over the past month and was at multi-year highs against the euro, pound sterling and New Zealand dollar. ", " The increase in the cash rate in early March had been passed through in full to most variable lending rates. Members noted that lending rates for housing and business were a little below their averages for the period since 1997. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Recent data for the world economy suggested that the recovery in the major advanced economies was still tentative, but that the expansion in most of Australia's major trading partners in Asia was proceeding strongly. This was feeding through into significant increases in the prices of resource commodities, including increases in the contract prices for coal and iron ore, which were larger than had been expected a few months ago. While there were a number of risks to the outlook for the global economy, the most likely scenario was one where growth in global output was close to trend over the next few years. ", " In the view of the Board, with forecasts suggesting that growth in the domestic economy in 2010 would be around trend and that inflation would be around 2½ per cent, consistent with the medium-term target, the level of interest rates in the economy would be expected to be close to average. This remained the underlying rationale for consideration of any adjustment to the cash rate in the current period. Since lending rates were still a little below average, members expected that they would probably need to rise further in the period ahead. ", " On the question of timing, the fact that the prospective rise in the terms of trade was now likely to be noticeably stronger than had been expected was a factor suggesting that it might be prudent not to delay adjustment. Overall, members considered that the outlook for the economy suggested that there was a case for a further step in the process of returning interest rates to more normal levels.

Growth in Asia remained strong and the focus in those economies was now on withdrawing policy stimulus to prevent inflationary pressures building. Conditions were now clearly improving in North America, though Europe remained weak. ", " The Chinese economy continued to expand strongly, with growth estimated at nearly 3 per cent in the March quarter and around 12 per cent over the year. While there had been a slowing in investment spending late in 2009, there had been a fresh acceleration early in 2010. Housing prices had been growing rapidly, with particularly strong growth early in 2010. The authorities were taking a range of steps to cool the market, including increases in the interest rate and in minimum deposits required for repeat home buyers and investors. ", " Recent data for other economies in Asia had been strong. GDP data for Korea had shown growth of nearly 2 per cent in the March quarter and 8 per cent over the year, and GDP data for Singapore had also been strong. The ongoing recovery in east Asia was feeding through into broad-based falls in unemployment in the higher-income economies. Inflation had increased in these economies, but only modestly so far. ", " The US economy was continuing to recover, growing by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter and 2½ per cent over the year. Domestic demand was becoming a more important driver of growth, with the contribution from the inventory cycle declining. Equipment investment had risen for a second quarter, although construction investment – particularly commercial property construction – had continued to decline. Household consumption spending was growing solidly. ", " While the information becoming available on the Japanese economy had been reasonably positive, data for European economies continued to be fairly soft. The UK economy had grown modestly in the March quarter, but activity in the euro area appeared fairly flat. Growth in exports was providing the main support to domestic production. The most recent data showed that retail sales were still trending downwards, and uncertainty surrounding Greece's fiscal problems was likely to prolong this weakness (see discussion below under ‘Financial Markets’). "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The major news on the domestic economy had been the further strengthening in commodity markets and the slightly higher-than-expected inflation data for the March quarter. ", " Most indicators of the domestic economy continued to suggest that it was expanding at a reasonable pace. Although conditions varied somewhat across sectors, business surveys suggested that business conditions were at relatively strong levels. Employment was estimated to have grown at a solid pace in March, though growth appeared to have slowed a little from the rapid pace seen in late 2009. Forward-looking indicators of the labour market suggested solid growth in the period ahead. The earlier decline in business credit appeared to have ended and liaison was providing more indications that banks were looking to boost their lending to that sector. ", " Consumer surveys continued to indicate that households were confident about the future, but that their perceptions about current conditions in the economy were closer to average levels. Consumption spending had been quite subdued, consistent with some caution on the part of households, perhaps reflecting some impact from rising interest rates. ", " The housing market had remained strong, especially in Melbourne and Sydney. Nationwide, average prices had grown by around 1 per cent per month in the first three months of 2010 and auction clearance rates had remained strong in April. This was despite the fact that housing loan approvals for owner-occupiers had continued to decline. Members noted the weakness in approvals for home-building in the high-rise apartment sector, especially outside the capital cities. ", " The ongoing strength in global, and especially Chinese, steel production was feeding through into strong demand for steel-related commodities. Contract prices for iron ore were estimated to have risen by close to 100 per cent in the June quarter, with spot prices strengthening further since those contracts had been negotiated. Coking coal prices had recently also risen significantly. ", " Given these increases in commodity prices, the staff forecast for the terms of trade had been revised upwards. The terms of trade were now expected to rise by close to 20 per cent over 2010, boosting nominal incomes by around 4 per cent. In the medium term, the terms of trade were forecast to decline somewhat, as additional global supply in commodity markets came on stream. Members discussed the expansionary effects of boosts to the terms of trade and the experience in some previous episodes. ", " The staff forecast for growth had been revised up somewhat, partly reflecting the stronger outlook for the terms of trade. While GDP growth was still expected to be around 3¼ per cent over 2010, it was expected to pick up in 2011 and 2012 to be in the 3¾–4 per cent range. Growth in private demand was expected to strengthen through this year. A very large increase in engineering investment was forecast, and business investment (excluding livestock) was expected to rise to its highest share of GDP seen in the five decades of quarterly national accounts. As a result, the capital stock was expected to continue to grow at a high rate. Growth in household consumption was expected to be somewhat below the rate seen in earlier periods of strong income growth, with a gradual rise in the saving rate. ", " Members discussed the March quarter inflation data, which showed that underlying inflation had continued to fall in year-ended terms. However, the quarterly increase in prices was slightly higher than expected at the time of the February <cite>Statement on Monetary                                       Policy</cite>. Underlying inflation was around 0.8 per cent in the quarter and 3 per cent over the year. CPI inflation was also close to 3 per cent. The prices of tradable items (excluding fuel and food) had fallen in the quarter, reflecting discounting by retailers, the sharp exchange rate appreciation during 2009 and tariff cuts that had taken effect in January. In contrast, non-tradables inflation (excluding deposit &amp; loan facilities) had picked up to a year-ended rate of 4.4 per cent, with significant increases in the prices of housing-related items, most notably utilities. ", " Reflecting recent developments in inflation and the stronger outlook for the economy, the staff forecast for inflation had been revised up a little. Underlying inflation was now expected to fall to around 2¾ per  cent over 2010, compared with the forecast of 2½ per cent in February. It was then expected to trend gradually higher to around 3 per cent over 2012. CPI inflation was expected to be somewhat above underlying inflation in 2010, in part because of the large tax-driven increase in the price of tobacco. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members spent considerable time discussing the financial problems facing the Greek Government, the resulting turmoil in financial markets and the implications for the global economy. The key facts were: Greece's sovereign credit rating had been downgraded by all three rating agencies; details of a financial assistance package from euro area governments and the IMF had now been finalised; and the European Central Bank had decided to suspend its collateral standards to ensure that Greek debt remained eligible in its repurchase operations. The announcements had not calmed markets; spreads on Greek government debt had widened further and the market in Greek debt had become dysfunctional. ", " Members discussed the serious challenges the Greek authorities faced in order to overcome the current financial difficulties. The large fiscal consolidation required over the next several years was likely to lead to a serious economic contraction. Members considered the risk of contagion to other countries in Europe and noted that the sovereign debt of Spain and Portugal had also been downgraded. However, to date, the problems in debt markets had been predominantly confined to Europe, though global equity markets and exchange rates had been affected. ", " Yields on 10-year government debt had fallen in the major countries, including those in the larger countries of the euro area following a flight to quality. Australian government bond yields had also fallen slightly. Emerging market sovereign debt spreads had been largely unaffected by the crisis in Greek public finances, apart from rises in spreads on debt of emerging European economies. There had been virtually no effect on corporate bond markets, where market conditions were still improving and the default rate on speculative grade debt had declined from its peak reached in 2009. ", " World equity markets had reached a 19-month high during April, bolstered by better-than-expected first-quarter earnings results, particularly in the United States, before being affected by the deterioration in the situation in Greece towards the end of the month. Greek share prices had fallen sharply over the past month, with banking shares particularly hard hit. Uncertainty over the effect of policy tightening by the Chinese authorities had led to a significant fall in Chinese share prices. ", " Turning to foreign exchange markets, members observed that the euro had depreciated further over the past month, but currency markets overall had been fairly calm. The US dollar had appreciated in trade-weighted terms, reflecting its rise against European currencies, but had depreciated against a range of Asian currencies. It was slightly lower over the year in trade-weighted terms. Over the past month, the Australian dollar was little changed against the US dollar, had reached new highs against the euro and had appreciated moderately on a trade-weighted basis. It was almost 20 per cent higher over the past year. ", " Australian banks had issued a relatively small amount of bonds in April following the large amount of issuance in recent quarters, which had put their funding on a good footing. There had been continued strong Kangaroo bond issuance over the past month. ", " Competition among the banks for deposits had levelled off somewhat over recent months, with rates on term deposit specials flat since the end of 2009, albeit at high levels relative to other interest rates. The increase in the cash rate in April had been passed through to intermediaries' lending rates in full. Housing and business lending rates were now a little below the average of the past decade and a half. ", " Monetary policy had been tightened in several emerging market economies over the past month: in India, the repo rate and reserve requirements had been raised; in China, the reserve ratio on banks was lifted further and a range of other measures tightened to curb property price inflation; and there had also been policy tightening in Brazil. The Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that it would allow the exchange rate to appreciate as a means to tighten policy. Expectations were for tightening in Canada and New Zealand around mid year, but any tightening in other major countries was not expected before the end of the year. ", " In Australia, expectations of a further rise in the cash rate at this meeting had strengthened following the release of the CPI for the March quarter. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that, even though the global recovery continued to be uneven, the overall pace of global growth this year was likely to be at least average. Importantly for Australia, Asia was expanding strongly. There had been further sharp increases in commodity prices and it was likely that Australia's terms of trade this year would recover to the high levels reached in 2008. This would provide a large boost to nominal income. ", " At present, the domestic economy appeared to be growing at an around average pace, although conditions varied across sectors of the economy. Retail spending was relatively subdued but investment was strong. New housing loan approvals had slowed but the overall pace of housing credit growth remained solid. Credit conditions for parts of the business sector were starting to improve. The latest forecasts suggested that domestic output growth was likely to strengthen further over the next couple of years, with the expansionary effects of the rise in the terms of trade more than offsetting the scaling back of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Labour market conditions were expected to continue to tighten gradually. ", " Members noted that the latest inflation numbers were a little above the expectation. Even though inflationary pressures in the traded sector had been held in check, partly owing to tariff cuts and the appreciation of the exchange rate, there had been strong rises in the prices of many services, which suggested that these sectors of the economy were operating with limited spare capacity. The forecast for inflation had been revised up, and over the next couple of years it was likely that inflation would not be much below the top of the target range. ", " Members spent considerable time discussing the disturbances in financial markets arising from concerns about sovereign debt in parts of Europe, with their focus particularly, but not only, on Greece. The measures of financial support for Greece so far announced had not managed to calm markets. There was a risk that the situation could worsen further, damaging the global economic recovery. However, while there had been some decline in global equity prices and some impact on exchange rates, so far at least there had not been significant contagion to debt markets outside Europe; the direct impact of Greece on Australia was considered to be small. The timeframe over which developments might play out was not clear, and it could be some time before the uncertainties were resolved. ", " Members noted that the increases in interest rates to date had been timely. There were some early signs that they were beginning to affect behaviour, with retail sales subdued and housing loan approvals falling noticeably. Nonetheless, the stimulatory effects of the resources boom would be building over the year ahead. Members were conscious of the need for this not to result in a material worsening in the medium-term outlook for inflation. This was weighed against the case that could be made for a pause in the process of normalising interest rates owing to the uncertainty in the euro area. On balance, members judged it to be prudent to undertake some further monetary tightening at this meeting. They noted that, if lenders responded as expected to another rise in the cash rate, interest rates faced by most borrowers would then be at around their average levels over the past decade. Members felt that this would leave monetary policy well placed for the present. The Board therefore supported another rise in the cash rate. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to raise the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.5 per cent, effective 5 May. "]}},

"], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Philip Lowe (Assistant Governor, Economic), Tony Richards (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Acting Secretary) "], "Financial Markets": [" Developments in the euro area had dominated events in financial markets in the past month. Sentiment had deteriorated sharply in the period following the previous Board meeting as concerns about the fiscal position of Greece, Spain and Portugal intensified. The poor sentiment led to a marked scaling back of trading in bonds issued by European sovereigns outside Germany. Members were briefed on details of the European support package developed by the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF. Since then yields had fallen somewhat, though trading conditions had generally remained poor with low liquidity. ", " Members noted that yields had also declined in most major bond markets around the globe. Australian bond yields had been part of this trend. Members noted that the recent Australian Government Budget showed that debt levels were expected to peak at a significantly lower level than previously projected. ", " Funding pressures in global money markets had increased, but to a much lesser extent than in 2008. They mainly related to US dollar markets, owing to the need for European banks to fund large US dollar asset holdings. The major central banks had announced a re-establishment of temporary US dollar swap lines with the Federal Reserve but the take-up thus far had been limited, given that the rate central banks were charging for use of the facility was currently above the market rate facing most institutions. ", " In Australia, while the spread between bank bill yields and the expected cash rate had widened somewhat in the past few weeks, the market had continued to function well, albeit with slightly increased volatility. ", " Credit spreads on emerging market and corporate bonds had increased around the globe. However, members noted that, despite the increased spreads, actual borrowing costs had fallen in some cases, given the falls in benchmark yields. ", " Corporate bond issuance in May had been minimal in both the United States and the euro area as a result of the dislocation in markets. The Australian banks did not need to access term debt markets for several months as they were ahead on their funding needs for the year, but there were indications that there remained good underlying demand for Australian bank debt in overseas markets. ", " Global share markets had been volatile and share prices had fallen significantly over the past month. In addition to the developments in Europe, two factors had adversely affected investor sentiment: the large intra-day fall on the US share market on 6 May, whose cause in part appeared to relate to the activities of model-based high-frequency trading platforms; and the unexpected announcement by the German financial regulator of a ban on ‘naked’ short-selling of a range of financial instruments. ", " Foreign exchange markets had also seen the effect of investors' reduced willingness to take on risk. Volatility in exchange rates had increased significantly. The euro had depreciated further against the US dollar in May, but from a longer-run perspective was not at a particularly low level in trade-weighted terms. The US dollar had appreciated against most currencies during May, with the exception of the yen. The renminbi had remained fixed to the US dollar at the rate set almost two years earlier; the broad appreciation of the US dollar over the past month implied that the renminbi had appreciated in nominal trade-weighted terms. ", " There had been several large moves in the Australian dollar exchange rate over the past month. Partly, this reflected the fact that many traders had taken ‘long’ positions in the Australian dollar against other currencies, in terms of their benchmark exposures, and the exchange rate fell as a consequence of these positions being unwound. Members were informed that the depreciation of the exchange rate generally had been orderly, with a satisfactory level of liquidity in the market. The exchange rate had depreciated by about 7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past month; volatility had been high but was below the peak level in October 2008. Taking a longer perspective, the Australian dollar remained well above its post-float average, both against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms. ", " Turning to monetary policy settings, members observed that the expected commencement of policy tightening in the major economies had now been pushed out into next year, with the exception of Canada. In Australia, market pricing at the time of the meeting indicated that no change in the cash rate was expected. Members noted that the increase in the cash rate at the previous meeting had been passed through to lending interest rates in full, and that lending rates to both households and businesses were now around their average levels of the past decade. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in the international economy by observing that the recent turmoil in financial markets had prompted a number of European governments to announce a significant tightening of fiscal policy. A few months earlier, it had appeared that those economies with poor fiscal positions might be able to wait until economic recovery was more firmly entrenched before undertaking significant fiscal consolidation. However, the escalation of market uncertainties meant that the downside risks from waiting to announce tighter fiscal policy had increased. The fiscal measures announced had included pay freezes or pay cuts for public-sector employees, increases in the retirement age and increases in value-added tax rates. ", " Members discussed the fiscal challenges facing Europe. Sizeable budget deficits were expected to persist for a number of years in some countries. This was in part a reflection of the large structural deficits that had built up over the years, with breaches of the deficit limit of the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact having not been unusual, even when economic conditions had been relatively benign. Debt to GDP ratios were projected to continue to increase significantly in many countries, raising concerns about fiscal sustainability. ", " Members noted that the fiscal challenges faced by many governments, not only in Europe, would be accentuated by the changes in demographic patterns that were occurring in most countries, notably ageing populations and rising dependency ratios. ", " Growth in much of Europe had been soft, though economic conditions were somewhat brighter in Germany, with industrial production growing again and construction spending picking up. Members noted that growth in much of the rest of the world had been quite strong, especially in Asia. In China, retail sales, investment, exports and credit had all risen further in April, with investment particularly strong in the first four months of the year. In the housing market, growth in house prices had remained strong up to April, but there were indications of a slowing in turnover in May, suggesting that the policy measures taken earlier were having some effect on conditions. ", " Elsewhere in Asia, growth had continued to surprise on the upside, with domestic demand in the region growing solidly over the past year. A number of east Asian economies had registered double-digit GDP growth rates over the year to the March quarter, and data for exports and industrial production in April suggested that growth was continuing in the current quarter. India had recorded strong GDP growth in the March quarter and there had been an upward revision to the earlier and surprisingly weak figure for the December quarter. With Asia accounting for more than half of Japan's total exports, strength in domestic demand in the region was benefiting the Japanese economy, which had registered strong growth in the March quarter. ", " Economic conditions had also continued to improve in the United States. Employment was now growing again, after contracting through 2008 and 2009, and labour market participation had picked up. While higher participation would slow the prospective fall in the unemployment rate, growth in employment would help to support consumption growth. Business investment was rising and capital goods orders had increased strongly over the past year. ", " Overall, in contrast to the turbulence in financial markets, the recent data on global economic activity had generally been positive and suggested that the global economy was expanding at a relatively firm pace over the first part of 2010. It was too early to tell what effect the current turbulence in financial markets would have on the global recovery. It was likely that weaker activity in Europe would have some flow-on effects to the rest of the world through the traditional trade channels, though the more important consideration would be the extent to which the problems in Europe had a sustained effect on global attitudes to risk. Offsetting these effects, members observed that the uncertainty surrounding developments in Europe might mean that the process of withdrawing policy stimulus in other parts of the world, including in Asia, would be delayed. ", " The developments in financial markets and in Europe and concerns about a potential slowing in construction activity in China had resulted in falls in commodity prices over the past month. There had been significant declines in the prices for oil, iron ore and base metals. Nevertheless, spot prices for Australia's bulk commodities were still above those in the June quarter 2010 export contracts. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Domestically, members observed that conditions had been mixed. There had been a high level of activity in the construction sector from the fiscal stimulus, but retail spending had been relatively subdued and there were some signs of slowing in the housing market. The national accounts for the March quarter were due for release the day after the meeting. The staff expected the data to show modest growth in GDP for the quarter, with conditions varying across sectors of the economy. ", " In the household sector, surveys showed that sentiment had declined in May, though it remained above its long-run average level. Developments in household spending had been mixed. ABS data on retail trade, including figures that were released during the meeting, showed solid growth in spending in March and April, but spending was only modestly higher than a year earlier, when it had been boosted by government transfer payments. Liaison with retailers suggested fairly weak trading conditions more recently, with many retailers noting that significant discounting was occurring. In contrast, purchases of motor vehicles by the household sector had been strong this year. ", " Members noted some signs that the earlier buoyancy in the housing market was easing. Most notably, auction clearance rates in May had been lower than the very high levels of earlier months. Growth in housing credit had slowed in April, after a decline in loan approvals over the prior six months. ", " Business investment was estimated to have fallen in the March quarter, with this largely reflecting the earlier pull-forward of spending on plant and equipment as a result of tax incentives. The ABS capital expenditure survey continued to point to strong growth in spending on buildings and structures in 2010/11, especially in the mining sector, implying continued strong growth in the capital stock over the next year or so. ", " Most business surveys continued to point to above-average levels of business confidence and conditions. Construction activity was being supported by the strong growth in public spending, especially for building in the education sector. Construction in the office and commercial sectors remained weak, but there were signs of some pick-up in the apartment sector. Liaison suggested that financing conditions for firms in the construction sector were improving, though they remained tight. More broadly, business loan approvals also appeared to be rising, though business credit had declined in April after having been broadly unchanged over the preceding three months. ", " The Australian Government estimated that its budget deficit would narrow significantly in 2010/11 and return to a small surplus in 2012/13, three years earlier than projected a year ago. Policy changes announced in the Budget were, in net terms, broadly neutral for the cumulative budget position over the next four years. The projected narrowing of the deficit primarily reflected the effects of the improving economy (including the higher level of the terms of trade) and the scheduled winding down of stimulus measures announced in late 2008 and early 2009. ", " The labour market had continued to perform solidly, with a further increase in employment in April. With population growth remaining high, the unemployment rate had been broadly steady over the past few months, after declining around the turn of the year. Surveys of firms' hiring intentions remained solid, and some skills shortages had emerged in the mining and construction sectors. ", " The main piece of news on wages and prices over the past month was the wage price index, which suggested that wage growth in the private sector had picked up in the first quarter of 2010 from the low rates of the preceding three quarters. In the public sector, wage growth remained quite firm and above the average of the past decade. Measures of inflation expectations were generally at, or a little above, the average of the past decade or so. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the setting of monetary policy, members noted that the situation in Europe had deteriorated significantly over the previous month. Market confidence had been severely eroded, and some governments were now in the very difficult position of having to tighten fiscal policy at a time when growth remained weak. Notwithstanding the actions that had been taken by European policymakers and the IMF, the situation remained uncertain. The difficulties in Europe would inevitably weigh somewhat on prospects for global growth. However, in areas such as Asia where growth had recently been strong, it had become more likely that the withdrawal of policy stimulus would be delayed as a result of the developments in Europe. ", " While the international environment facing the Australian economy had become more uncertain, members noted that the medium-term outlook remained positive. The prices of Australia's main commodity exports were still elevated, despite recent falls, and the high level of the terms of trade would add to domestic incomes and demand. Most indicators suggested that the economy was continuing to expand and employment growth had been solid. Conditions, however, clearly differed across sectors and aggregate spending was still being supported by public demand. While recent data for prices and wages suggested that the disinflationary forces in the economy were not quite as strong as previously expected, global events could also have implications for the inflation outlook in the medium term. Members noted that the CPI data for the June quarter, which would be released in late July, would provide information on the extent of inflationary pressures in the economy. ", " As a result of actions at previous meetings, policy had moved from the very expansionary settings reached in early 2009 to the point where interest rates paid by borrowers were now around their average levels of the past decade or so. Members judged that these previous actions afforded policy the flexibility to await information on how the recent market uncertainty might affect the global economy, as well as news about the outlook for inflation. For the near term, therefore, members judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.5 per cent. "]}},

", " Various pieces of data had pointed to some loss of momentum in the US economy. GDP growth in the June quarter was revised down to a below-trend rate. Household incomes and confidence had been subdued, in part owing to the continued weakness in the labour market, where data for payrolls and jobless claims had been disappointing. Sales of new and existing homes had dropped sharply following the expiration of the homebuyers' tax credit at the end of April. With the number of vacant housing units still rising, construction of new homes was likely to remain weak. More positively, profit growth in the business sector had been reasonably firm and investment spending was rising again from the very low levels of last year. Industrial production had continued to grow and the ISM index for the manufacturing sector was at an above-average level. Overall, with households expected to continue deleveraging and the boost from the inventory cycle declining, members thought it was likely that growth in the US economy would be quite subdued over the next few quarters. ", " Momentum had also slowed in Asia, though this broadly appeared to have brought growth back to a more sustainable pace after the earlier surge. Across much of the region, industrial production and exports had moved sideways over recent months, following the very strong growth earlier in the year. Other indicators of economic activity, however, suggested a somewhat stronger picture, with domestic demand growing solidly. Japan was the main exception, with the economy continuing to operate with considerable excess capacity. Members also discussed the recent increases in trade surpluses in a number of east Asian economies. ", " In China, retail sales had increased strongly over recent months, and credit growth had remained firm, albeit below the extraordinary rates seen in 2009. Of particular relevance to Australia, Chinese steel production had fallen over the past few months. However, steel and iron ore prices had held up, suggesting there was still solid underlying demand for steel. There had also been a noticeable slowing in growth in fixed asset investment, partly reflecting the withdrawal of the earlier fiscal stimulus, but private investment had continued to expand. ", " In Europe, after a period of quite gloomy news earlier in the year, recent data had tended to surprise on the upside, particularly in the United Kingdom and Germany. The latter had benefited from strong demand for its exports of capital goods. Elsewhere in the euro area, growth continued to be modest. However, euro area consumer and business sentiment had been surprisingly resilient in recent months, while new capital goods orders had risen strongly, pointing to growth in business investment in the near term. Notwithstanding the more positive tone to the recent data, the medium-term economic outlook for Europe still looked quite weak given the public debt problems in a number of countries. ", " Spot commodity prices had generally risen a little over the past month, after falling during May and June. In the June quarter, the terms of trade rose by 12½ per cent – reflecting the large increase in bulk commodity contract prices – to be slightly above the very high level reached in 2008. A further increase in the terms of trade was expected in the September quarter, followed by a modest decline. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The recent data on the domestic economy had been positive and had provided further evidence that the economy was growing at around trend pace. ", " The national accounts for the June quarter had shown an increase in real GDP of 1.2 per cent in the quarter and an upward revision to the estimate for the March quarter. GDP was up by 3.3 per cent over the year, which was around the average growth rate for the past two decades. In nominal terms, GDP rose by 10 per cent over the year, reflecting the large increase in the value of exports. The rise in commodity prices, together with the growth in resource export volumes, had seen the trade balance record its largest surplus (as a share of GDP) since 1973. ", " Public demand continued to contribute to GDP growth in the June quarter, though by significantly less than in earlier quarters, and it was expected to subtract from growth over the next few quarters as stimulus projects were gradually completed. Private demand was recorded as having grown strongly in the quarter, with both consumption and dwelling construction showing solid increases. ", " While business investment fell slightly in the quarter, the capital expenditure survey for the June quarter showed a significant upgrading of investment intentions from what was already a positive outlook. Members discussed the factors underpinning this increase, including high commodity prices, strong corporate profitability and above-average levels of capacity utilisation. Members expected that the boost to investment in the resources sector would stimulate activity elsewhere in the economy, even though there was a significant imported component in the planned LNG projects. Business surveys reported that conditions remained at, or above, average levels, though confidence had softened a little. The main area of weakness continued to be commercial construction, where funding constraints remained an issue. Business credit had remained broadly flat over recent months, though lending to small business had increased. ", " Members discussed trends in the household sector, where there was some evidence to suggest that the cautious approach to spending seen over recent times could be starting to wane. While retailers continued to report that conditions were challenging, retail spending had picked up in recent months and the national accounts measure of consumption was surprisingly strong in the June quarter. This strength was, however, partly a reflection of a boost to spending on motor vehicles following damage from hailstorms in Victoria and Western Australia. Consumer confidence was at high levels and labour income growth had been solid. In contrast, the household sector's reduced appetite for debt was continuing, with housing credit growth easing over recent months and repayments of credit card debt picking up. ", " Conditions had cooled in the established housing market, partly reflecting the return of mortgage rates to more normal levels. At the national level, prices had been broadly unchanged since April, with the top end of the market tending to be softer than the rest of the market. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had been around average levels recently, after having been considerably above average earlier in the year. Housing loan approvals were estimated to have been broadly flat in July and were well below their peak in late 2009. ", " In the labour market, hiring remained strong. Employment rose by 23,000 in July, to be 2¾ per cent higher over the year. Business surveys and data on job advertisements suggested further solid gains in employment over coming months. The unemployment rate had risen a little to 5.3 per cent in July and had been broadly unchanged since the start of the year, which was consistent with the economy growing at around trend pace. ", " The main news on prices and wages had been the release of the June quarter wage price index, which showed that wage growth in the private sector had remained relatively modest, though it had picked up a little over the first half of 2010. In contrast, growth in public-sector wages had continued at a firm pace. Business surveys and liaison suggested that a gradual pick-up in wage growth was expected over the next year. ", " Several measures of inflation expectations had eased a little over recent months to be around average levels. Similarly, business surveys reported that the share of businesses planning to increase their prices over coming months was around average. "], "Financial Markets": [" Financial markets had been fairly pessimistic for much of August, though sentiment had improved somewhat late in the month. This pessimism had been reflected in a marked decline in government bond yields, which had fallen to low levels in the major advanced economies. This was particularly so at the shorter end of the yield curve, reflecting the expectation that policy rates in the major economies would remain low for an extended period. Locally, long-term yields had also fallen noticeably, though less so than in other countries, reflecting the stronger domestic economy. ", " Yields on securities issued by higher-rated corporates also fell to low levels in the United States. This had generated a solid amount of corporate issuance, which had offset the decline in intermediated business credit. ", " With official interest rates in the major economies likely to be on hold for the foreseeable future, the focus of markets had been on developments in central bank balance sheets. During the month, the Federal Reserve announced that the repayments of principal on its agency securities would be reinvested into US Treasuries, so that its balance sheet would not contract. The Bank of Japan also announced an extension of its longer-dated liquidity provision. ", " While bond yields in the largest economies had declined sharply, spreads on bonds issued by some smaller European countries had widened again. Contributing to this in Ireland was a sovereign ratings downgrade, amid concern about the amount of guaranteed bank debt maturing in the near future and the announcement that the Government had made a further significant capital injection into one of the large Irish banks. In Greece, the first quarterly review of the support program from the European Commission, ECB and IMF had been completed, indicating that the program was on track. Members noted the significant amount of financing that Greek banks were receiving from the ECB and the challenges the Greek economy was facing. ", " In the Australian bond market, there had been a sizeable amount of issuance in August by banks and foreign institutions. There had also been continued issuance in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. Investor demand for the shorter-dated tranches had been quite strong. The Australian Office of Financial Management had supported issuance of such securities by purchasing most of the longer-dated tranches. ", " Global equity markets had been mixed over the month, and Australian share prices had shown little net change since the previous Board meeting. The domestic company reporting season for the first half of 2010 had been generally positive. Aggregate underlying profits had increased solidly, while headline profits were bolstered by a marked decline in write-downs. Profits were particularly strong in the resources sector, while financial stocks had also fared well. ", " In currency markets, the focus had been on the Japanese yen, which was close to historical highs in nominal terms. However, in real effective terms the yen was not at a particularly high level, reflecting the long period of deflation experienced in Japan. Nevertheless, Japanese policy-makers had expressed their concern about the elevated level of the yen. Locally, the Australian dollar had risen after the release of the strong GDP data. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. Notwithstanding the issues stemming from the fiscal problems of some European economies, the health of the large international banks had mostly improved. Investor sentiment had been bolstered by the euro area support package and the results of the banking system stress test. Conditions in the Australian financial system remained significantly stronger than in most other countries. Members noted that exposures of Australian banks to the fiscally stretched euro area economies were very small. ", " Even though bank share price indices in the major developed countries had generally fallen somewhat over the past six months, reported profitability and capitalisation of banking systems had improved. Many large banks in the United States, euro area, United Kingdom and Japan had recorded profits over recent reporting periods, though profits were generally still well below pre-crisis levels. In a number of cases, the flow of provisions for bad loans appeared to have peaked. However, bank lending in the major economies remained very soft. ", " The Australian banking system continued to be in a relatively strong condition. Having remained profitable during the crisis, the largest banks had seen a pick-up in profitability over the past half-year, reflecting increased interest income and a decline in bad and doubtful debt charges. The rate of non-performing assets appeared to have stabilised, and was at a level far below the peak following the early 1990s recession, with significant write-backs of earlier provisioning now occurring as asset quality improved. The earlier pick-up in non-performing assets had been mostly in business lending, and non-performing loans to the household sector were relatively low. Members noted that non-performance rates for housing loans were far below those seen in the United States and some European countries. ", " The banking sector's capital position had been bolstered by actions in recent years to increase the level of capital through a combination of new equity issuance and dividend reinvestment plans. Banks had also moved to strengthen their liquidity positions by lengthening the term structure of their wholesale liabilities. ", " The aggregate financial position of the household and business sectors remained sound, with the stronger economy boosting wage incomes and profits. Indicators of financial stress in the household sector remained low compared with previous downturns and international experience. Households appeared to be taking a more cautious approach to their finances, with the household debt-to-income ratio broadly stable over the past few years, after a decade when it grew rapidly. Banks had also taken a relatively cautious approach to lending in the post-crisis environment, with a significant fall over the past year in the proportion of new housing loans with loan-to-value ratios over 90 per cent. Measures of the financial health of the corporate sector were favourable, with gearing and interest payment ratios close to the lowest levels in three decades. Businesses had relied significantly on equity issuance and internally generated funds over the past few years. Debt funding availability now appeared to be improving somewhat after a marked tightening in supply in 2008 and 2009, though credit availability for some sectors, including commercial property, remained constrained. ", " Members were briefed on recent international work on regulatory reform to strengthen financial systems and Australia's representations on the matter. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted the increase in concerns over the past month about the outlook for the US economy and government debt in some European countries, which was weighing on market sentiment globally. However, at the same time there had been further evidence that the Australian economy had solid momentum and that firms expected to increase investment significantly over the period ahead. Prospects in the resources sector were especially positive, and the increase in investment in this sector would have significant flow-on effects to the broader economy. Members observed that previous investment booms and increases in the terms of trade had posed significant challenges for economic policy, and that high levels of resource utilisation were likely to put pressure on inflation. ", " The central scenario remained for the Australian economy to grow at trend pace, or a bit above, over the next few years. This forecast incorporated quite a subdued outlook for the main G7 economies and around trend growth in Asia, with domestic demand in Asia playing a more important role than it had done historically. Members noted the risks to this outlook, including that the recent loss of momentum in the United States could develop into a renewed downturn or that the moderation of growth in China and east Asia could prove to be larger than currently expected. If these risks eventuated, or if there were new financial shocks, another round of extreme risk aversion could result, with adverse implications for the global economy. ", " While policy had to be alert to these risks, members considered that if the central scenario came to pass it was likely that higher interest rates would be required, at some point, to ensure that inflation remained consistent with the medium-term target. For the immediate decision, there had been no significant change in the overall outlook, with conditions looking a little stronger domestically than they had at the previous meeting, but looking a little weaker internationally. With the economy currently growing at around its trend rate, underlying inflation having moderated and lending rates at around average levels, the Board's assessment was that the current setting of monetary policy remained appropriate for the time being.

"], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Philip Lowe (Assistant Governor, Economic), Tony Richards (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Acting Secretary) "], "Financial Markets": [" Members were briefed on ongoing tensions in European financial markets. Concerns over the fiscal position of some European countries had persisted since the June meeting. Moody's had downgraded Greece's debt in mid June, so that Greece was no longer rated investment grade by any of the three major rating agencies. Moody's had also placed Spain's AAA rating on review for possible downgrade. There had been some adverse sentiment over the outlook in Hungary following statements about the fiscal situation by the new government. ", " Amid heightened concern over the health of the European banking system, European authorities announced that results of a stress test of the largest European banks would be publicly released in the second half of July. Members observed that, in order to settle markets, it was critical that the stress tests be regarded as credible and that plans be in place to deal with any capital shortfall identified by the stress tests. ", " For the major economies sovereign-level yields had fallen, with US 10-year yields falling below 3 per cent and German yields declining back to historic lows. Australian Government yields had also fallen over the month to 5 per cent. Although there was little market trading, indicative pricing suggested a widening in spreads for Greece and a number of other euro area economies. The European Central Bank (ECB) had purchased €59 billion in euro area sovereign debt securities since its buying operations had started a few weeks earlier. ", " Members discussed recent developments in the market operations of the ECB. They noted that the maturing of the large one-year liquidity operation had occurred relatively smoothly on 1 July and been replaced by a smaller three-month injection. Nonetheless, there had been some increase in money market spreads, although these remained far lower than over mid 2007 to mid 2009. There had, however, been some tiering in spreads paid by different banks. ", " In Australia, the money market had continued to function well. There had been some upward drift in the Australian bank bills-to-OIS spread. Members noted that, as in previous years, the Bank had temporarily supplied extra liquidity at the end of the financial year. ", " The tensions in European financial markets had seen a further pushing back in the expectations of when central banks in the three largest advanced economies would begin tightening policy. However, about half a dozen other countries had announced monetary tightening during the month. These included three – Canada, New Zealand and Sweden – that took their initial steps in this cycle. Domestically, members noted there was no expectation of any change in monetary policy at the current meeting. ", " Globally, corporate bond issuance remained at low levels in June, although there had been some pick-up relative to May, mostly reflecting issuance of covered bonds in the euro area. Issuance by Australian entities had also picked up from the extremely low levels of May. Some of the large domestic banks had issued bonds. Members noted that the spreads on these issues were moderately higher than earlier in the year. There had been further issues in the local securitisation market, including the first US-dollar RMBS issue since the onset of the crisis in 2007. ", " Members discussed trends in the funding of Australian banks. Over the past couple of years, there had been a reduction in the share of funding coming from securitisation and short-term debt, and an increase in the share of domestic deposits and long-term debt. While there had recently been a modest increase in some funding costs, some lending rates (particularly for businesses) had risen in line with market rates, such that there had been little change in net interest margins. ", " Global equity markets had recovered somewhat in the first part of June, but turned down sharply again later in the month. The Chinese equity market had continued to record significant declines. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the major development had been the announcement by the People's Bank of China (PBC) of a change to the exchange rate regime. The PBC had reverted to the arrangement in place over 2005 to mid 2008, whereby the value of the renminbi would be adjusted in small increments on a daily basis. The PBC had stated that it viewed the exchange rate as close to fair value, and so far the daily changes had been small and in both directions, for a net appreciation of around 1 per cent. Over the past year, however, the renminbi had appreciated considerably in trade-weighted terms, reflecting its rise against the weakening euro. The Australian dollar had traded in a wide range but the trade-weighted index was little changed over the month. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The discussion then turned to international economic developments. Members noted that the global economy had continued to grow in the June quarter, although uncertainty about the future strength of the recovery had risen and downside risks were apparent, largely reflecting ongoing concerns about the fiscal situation in Europe and the health of the European banking system. In contrast, economies in Asia remained robust, although there were signs that growth in the region was moderating to a more sustainable pace after the strong V-shaped recovery of the previous year. ", " In Europe, many governments had recently announced discretionary tightening of fiscal policy. Spain, Italy and Portugal announced fiscal tightening amounting to at least 2 per cent of GDP over the coming year, while Greece had announced tightening measures equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP. Some of the larger economies had also announced some tightening of fiscal policy, although the cuts were smaller and would be implemented more gradually. ", " The timely survey data on euro area confidence and current business conditions had shown surprising resilience for the period since early May, despite the financial market turbulence. More generally, the economic data for a number of countries, most notably Germany, was more positive than had been the case a few months earlier, and it was likely that euro area GDP would record a solid rise in the June quarter after little growth over the previous half year. Members noted that the German labour market had held up very well over the past two years. ", " In China, retail sales, fixed asset investment, exports and credit had all grown strongly in May. On the other hand, growth in industrial production had moderated over the past few months. Members observed that some slowing in industrial production had been inevitable from the growth of over 20 per cent seen earlier this year. Conditions in the property market had also cooled, particularly in the major cities. Growth in higher-end residential construction was likely to slow over coming quarters, with the authorities encouraging growth in construction of housing for lower-income residents. ", " Wage growth in China had recently picked up noticeably. This was not surprising given the strong economic expansion over the past year and the freezes in provincial minimum wages in 2009. From a structural perspective, this growth could be regarded as a positive development if it were part of the shift in national income towards the household sector that is required over the longer run. In the short run, it could add to rising inflation pressures, although members noted that the authorities' new approach to the exchange rate had the potential to assist in macroeconomic management over the period ahead. ", " Elsewhere in Asia, there were also early signs that growth was returning to a more sustainable pace after the very strong bounce-back from the contraction in late 2008 and early 2009. Export volumes had continued to grow solidly and labour demand had been strong, although industrial production had been broadly unchanged in some economies over April and May. The Japanese economy was continuing to recover, although there remained considerable excess capacity. ", " In the United States, economic recovery was continuing at a moderate pace. This was most apparent in the business sector, especially in manufacturing. Indicators of business equipment investment were improving, business surveys were positive and industrial production had grown solidly. However, labour market conditions remained soft and the payrolls data (excluding census jobs) for May and June had been disappointing. Unlike in Europe, no new steps had yet been taken to tighten fiscal policy, although there would be some unwinding of temporary measures through this year. ", " The large output gaps in the United States and the euro area had been reflected in an ongoing decline in inflation, with core inflation running at annualised rates of ½–¾ per cent over the past half-year. Inflation was significantly higher in the United Kingdom, partly reflecting the increase in the VAT rate and the depreciation of the pound sterling. Inflation in China had picked up after the deflation seen in early 2009, although it appeared to have stabilised at an annualised rate of around 3 per cent over recent months. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The recent flow of data suggested that the domestic economy continued to expand at a solid pace, with public-sector spending providing support to activity. The national accounts for the March quarter had been released the day after the June meeting and showed an increase in GDP of 0.5 per cent in the quarter and 2.7 per cent over the year. Looking forward, the staff expected growth in private demand to pick up as investment strengthened, supported by high commodity prices. ", " Consumer sentiment remained modestly above its long-run average, although it had fallen recently. However, sales of motor vehicles to households had been strong in recent months and retail spending had recorded increases in March, April and May after showing little growth over the previous nine months. Liaison with retailers in late June suggested a slightly more positive picture than a few months ago, although many retailers reported that conditions remained subdued and that significant discounting had been required to drive sales. ", " Business surveys had also indicated some easing in confidence over recent months, although trading conditions remained a little above average levels. Recently, some measures of firms' investment intentions had increased quite strongly, and capital goods imports increased in May, which would be consistent with the staff forecast of a gradual pick-up in private-sector investment. In addition, the amount of work yet to be done in mining was very high, particularly for the LNG sector. Business credit had recorded a modest increase in May after declining for most of the preceding year and a half. Notwithstanding this, private non-residential approvals remained weak; if this persisted it suggested a tightening in some commercial property markets could emerge in the medium term. ", " The slowing in growth in Chinese steel production had been reflected in falls in iron ore and steel prices. Spot prices for iron ore were now below the estimated contract price for the September quarter. Spot prices for coking coal had also eased. Nevertheless, these prices remained very high from a longer-term perspective, and the terms of trade were approaching the peak level seen in 2008. ", " There were some signs that conditions in the established housing market had eased. In particular, auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had declined from their earlier elevated levels, with the clearance rate in Melbourne in June back around average levels. Price data to May were mixed but provided some tentative evidence of a deceleration in growth relative to earlier in the year. Members noted that price growth had been very strong in Melbourne. Housing credit growth in May had remained at around the average pace of the preceding year. ", " In the labour market, hiring had remained strong with employment having risen again in May, to be 2½ per cent higher over the year. Continuing the pattern of recent months, the increase was entirely driven by full-time jobs. Business surveys and data on job advertisements had been generally firm, suggesting further solid gains in employment in coming months. The unemployment rate had fallen to 5.2 per cent in May, which members noted was a significantly better outcome than had been expected a year earlier. ", " The federal minimum wage decision was for an increase of 4.8 per cent from 1 July, following the wage freeze last year. According to staff estimates, this implied an average increase for all workers on awards of around 3½ per cent, and was expected to have only a relatively small effect on overall wage growth. ", " Consumer price inflation data for the June quarter would be published on 28 July, and the staff expected them to show the underlying rate of inflation continuing to moderate in year-ended terms, to be below 3 per cent for the first time in three years. CPI inflation was, however, expected to rise to a little above 3 per cent, partly due to the effects of higher taxes on tobacco. Measures of inflation expectations had eased a little over the past month. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The global economy had continued to expand at around trend pace in recent months, although the pattern of growth was uneven among regions and developments in financial markets over the past month had highlighted some important risks. There had been further focus on the European fiscal situation and banking sector problems. While the measures being taken there should help the prospects for sustainable growth over the longer term, prospects for European growth going into 2011 were weaker. The US economy had shown moderate growth in the first half of 2010, but members noted that recent labour market outcomes had been disappointing. ", " Members saw some moderation in Asian growth as desirable, given concerns about possible overheating in those economies, but there was likely to be some uncertainty in the near term about the extent of the slowing. For Australia, a critical medium-term question was the extent to which economies in Asia could continue to grow strongly in the face of what could be an extended period of subdued conditions in the major North Atlantic economies. Overall, members considered that the most likely outcome was for growth in Australia's major trading partners to be around trend over the next couple of years. ", " The domestic economy had been growing at a solid rate over the past year, including a sizeable contribution from fiscal spending. The economy was now entering a period in which private demand was expected to strengthen due to a pick-up in business investment flowing from the high level of the terms of trade. This was expected to offset the scaling back in public demand that would be taking place. There were tentative signs that this ‘hand over’ from public to private demand may be starting to occur, though this would warrant careful monitoring. ", " As at the June meeting, members judged that the decisions at earlier meetings to increase the cash rate, which had resulted in interest rates paid by borrowers returning to around average levels, afforded flexibility to maintain steady settings in the face of increased international uncertainty. ", " Members noted that the coming month would see important announcements about the health of the European banking sector, which had the potential to have a significant impact on financial markets and global confidence. There would also be an updated reading on domestic prices. This was expected to show further moderation in the year-ended underlying rate, although underlying inflation was likely to remain in the top half of the target range over the period ahead. Headline inflation was expected to rise, owing to the effects of some tax increases, with the year-ended increase in the CPI rising above 3 per cent. The important question for the Board at its next meeting would be whether the new information materially changed the medium-term outlook for inflation. ", " Pending this information, the Board judged it appropriate to hold the cash rate unchanged. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to keep the cash rate unchanged at 4.5 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 3 August 2010"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Ric Battellino (Deputy Governor), Ken Henry AC (Secretary to the Treasury), John Akehurst, Jillian Broadbent AO, Roger Corbett AO, Graham Kraehe AO, Donald McGauchie AO, Warwick McKibbin "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Philip Lowe (Assistant Governor, Economic), Tony Richards (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Acting Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The economic data becoming available for the June quarter indicated that the global economy had continued its expansion, though conditions differed across regions. Growth in Australia's trading partners had been very strong, at around 6 per cent in export-weighted terms over the year to June. Broader measures of global growth, which placed a higher weight on the North Atlantic economies, had been lower but above trend over the past year. Recently, economic activity appeared to have strengthened in Europe after a half year of little growth, but there had been moderation in some other parts of the world. ", " Members noted that, in Asia, this moderation was occurring from a very rapid pace, and was likely to put these economies on a more sustainable path. In China, estimates of GDP had shown an increase of around 2½ per cent in the June quarter, which was another strong result but a little below the quarterly outcomes recorded over much of 2009. The monthly indicators suggested that investment had slowed in June, while growth in retail spending had remained firm. Members discussed developments in the Chinese property market, where the earlier policy measures were contributing to a cooling, with turnover lower and housing prices declining in a number of markets. There had also been a slowing in the construction sector and the production of inputs, such as cement and steel, after very strong growth in 2009. Overall, while the extent of slowing in the Chinese economy remained uncertain, the recent indicators did not suggest a more marked slowing than the staff had been expecting. ", " Growth in other parts of Asia remained solid but, as expected, it appeared to be moderating from the rapid pace seen over the previous year. There were indications of some slowing in the monthly data for industrial production and exports in Asian economies, as well as in the June quarter GDP data for Korea. The Indian economy had been expanding rapidly and was expected to remain strong, but inflation pressures remained elevated. In Japan, the expansion appeared to be continuing, though growth in exports and production had slowed over the past couple of months. In the household sector, measures of consumer sentiment had continued to rise to above-average levels, though the unemployment rate had recently edged up. ", " In Europe, the recent economic data had been better than expected, and measures of business and consumer sentiment in the larger countries did not appear to have been much affected by the recent concerns over fiscal policy. GDP growth in the June quarter was surprisingly strong in the United Kingdom, and a solid increase in euro area GDP was expected after little growth over the previous half year. Conditions in Germany were better than in most other countries, with consumer sentiment now well above its long-run average and the unemployment rate below its level prior to the recent recession. Members noted that Germany had been benefiting from earlier structural reforms, including of labour market policies, and had experienced a significant rise in its employment-to-population ratio over the past five years. Germany had also benefited from the depreciation of the euro over the past year or so. Notwithstanding recent positive developments, the outlook for Europe in 2011 would probably remain subdued, with fiscal consolidation and ongoing banking system repair likely to weigh on growth prospects. ", " The US economy had continued to expand, with GDP estimated to have grown by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter. This was somewhat slower than in the previous two quarters, and most forecasters were expecting only moderate growth over the second half of the year. Equipment investment had picked up further, business conditions remained generally positive and corporate profitability was strong for this stage of the cycle. However, the recent national accounts had contained a downward revision to the level of household consumption and an upward revision to the saving rate. Growth in household spending appeared to be slowing and consumer sentiment had fallen over recent months. The solid growth in output over the past year was yet to translate to a significant recovery in the labour market. ", " After weakening over May and June, commodity prices had tended to strengthen over the past month as concerns about the situation in Europe had eased and sentiment in financial markets had improved. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Domestically, the labour market has continued to firm. Employment increased by a further 46,000 in June, with growth of 3¼ per cent over the year. The unemployment rate was 5.1 per cent, around ¾ percentage point below its level in mid 2009. While this suggested that labour market conditions had tightened over the past year, other indicators, such as business surveys, suggested that businesses in most sectors were not encountering significant difficulty in finding suitable labour. In addition, average hours worked had picked up only modestly after falling significantly during late 2008 and early 2009. Members noted that a significant decline in the unemployment rate typically suggested that the economy had been growing at a rate above potential, though this stood in contrast to the GDP data, which suggested that growth had been below potential. ", " While growth had been boosted by fiscal stimulus over the past year and a half, this would be reversed in the period ahead as public investment declined following the completion of stimulus-related projects. At the same time, a strengthening in business investment was in prospect. Capital goods imports had increased over recent months and most survey-based measures of firms' investment intentions had increased. ", " Business conditions, as measured by surveys, remained at or above average levels. One area of weakness continued to be commercial construction, where financing conditions remained tight, though both liaison and approvals data provided some early indications of a strengthening in office construction. This was consistent with office vacancy rates having peaked in Sydney and Melbourne. Business credit was unchanged in June, though commercial loan approvals had been trending modestly higher over recent months. ", " Measures of consumer sentiment had risen in July to be at quite high levels again. The Bank's liaison with retailers suggested that households generally remained cautious in their spending, though a number of firms had reported that conditions had improved a little from earlier in the year. The retail trade data showed a further modest increase in spending in the month of June and a 0.8 per cent increase in the volume of spending in the June quarter. These data also provided evidence of significant discounting, with retail prices only 0.1 per cent higher in the quarter. ", " Members discussed broader trends in household behaviour. They noted that the household saving rate was at a higher level than a few years earlier, and credit growth was much lower than over the past decade. Household surveys suggested some change in attitudes to saving and a greater degree of caution about household finances. Looking ahead, members observed that the challenges of dealing with a terms of trade boom and strong growth in investment would be lessened if these trends in household behaviour continued. ", " There had been further signs of a cooling in the established housing market after a year of strong price increases. Housing prices had shown little growth over the past few months, with prices falling in June, including in Melbourne where price growth had earlier been strongest. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had declined significantly, to around average levels. Housing loan approvals were estimated to have declined further in June and housing credit growth had moderated. These developments suggested that the earlier increases in lending rates were having an effect on household behaviour. ", " The CPI data for the June quarter had showed a further decline in underlying inflation, consistent with the Bank's earlier forecasts. In underlying terms, inflation was around 0.5 per cent in the quarter and 2¾ per cent over the year. This was the first time that underlying inflation had been below 3 per cent in nearly three years, though headline CPI inflation was a little higher, at 3.1 per cent, with a significant contribution from the effects of the increased tobacco excise. ", " Members noted that the moderation in inflation reflected a combination of factors, including the relatively subdued demand conditions over much of 2008 and 2009, the slowing in private-sector wage growth in 2009 and the appreciation of the exchange rate. Discounting at retail stores had continued to depress the prices of many goods. There had also been a large decline in the price of domestic holiday travel and accommodation, partly reflecting subdued demand in parts of that industry. Food price inflation had been relatively low, reflecting softness in the prices of some global food commodities, the appreciation of the exchange rate and discounting. Unlike in previous quarters, there was little change in utilities prices, though substantial rises were expected over the next year. ", " Members discussed the updated staff forecasts, which were little changed from the forecasts prepared at the time of the May meeting. The central forecast was for GDP growth to increase gradually to the 3¾–4 per cent range in 2011 and 2012. The outlook was underpinned by the positive prospects for the resources sector, which in turn rested on the bright medium-term outlook for the economies in Asia. Reflecting developments in commodity markets over the past three months, the forecast for the terms of trade had been revised down slightly since May, but the terms of trade would still be at an historically high level and were expected to continue supporting domestic incomes and business investment. ", " The central forecast for inflation was essentially unchanged. Underlying inflation was expected to be around 2¾ per cent over the next year or so, though year-ended headline inflation was likely to be above 3 per cent over the next year, largely reflecting the rise in tobacco excise and large increases in the prices of utilities. Underlying inflation was then expected to increase gradually to around 3 per cent in 2012. This reflected the expectation that strong economic growth associated with the expansion of the resources sector would again put pressure on the economy's supply capacity. Members noted that there remained both upside and downside risks around these central forecasts. "], "Financial Markets": [" The main influence on financial markets over the past month had been the publication of the results of the stress test of the European banking system, conducted on 91 institutions representing two-thirds of banking system assets. Members discussed the nature and results of the stress test. They noted that financial markets had generally responded favourably to the results, in part because of the information provided about banks' exposures, including their sovereign debt holdings. ", " Sovereign yields in the major economies rose somewhat after the stress test results were published and the release of stronger euro area economic data, but they remained at low levels. Yields on government debt in Australia over the past month had moved in a similar fashion to those in the major economies. ", " Spreads on the sovereign debt of the smaller European countries had fallen over the past month, and debt issuance by a number of these countries over the past month had been oversubscribed. Spreads on emerging market debt in Asia and Latin America had also declined over the past month. Spreads on corporate debt in the United States and euro area had also fallen, with issuance by European financial institutions increasing following the publication of the stress test results, as well as favourable banks' earnings reports. Members noted that, in the United States, issuance of mortgage-backed securities continued to be dominated by the mortgage agencies. ", " Turning to monetary policy settings around the world, members noted that policy rates had not changed in the major economies, where expectations of any change had been pushed out until well into 2011 at the earliest. This had resulted in two-year bond yields in the major countries declining further, including to a 70-year low in the United States. Monetary policy operations by the European Central Bank (ECB) had provided less liquidity over the past month and debt purchases had slowed considerably, which led to a decline in the ECB's balance sheet. Euro area interbank lending rates had risen back towards the 1 per cent policy rate, following a period in which these rates had been around ½ percentage point below it. Central banks in several other countries had begun to raise policy rates. The Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of New Zealand increased their policy rates by 25 basis points for the second consecutive month. In emerging market economies, the central banks of Brazil, Chile, India, Israel and Malaysia raised rates over the past month. ", " Global equity market price indices rose in July, supported by the stress test results, stronger data from Europe and better-than-expected corporate earnings. Equity prices had largely retraced their sharp falls of a month earlier, but remained below their peaks in mid April. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar depreciated against most currencies over the past month, as US economic data were generally below expectations, in contrast to data for other regions. Following its initial appreciation after the change in the exchange rate regime in June, the renminbi had been little changed against the US dollar, which implied that it had depreciated on a trade-weighted basis because of the US dollar's broad-based depreciation. The Australian dollar had appreciated by around 5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, with a larger rise against the US dollar, reflecting relatively strong domestic economic data early in the month and a general increase in risk appetite among market participants. ", " Members discussed developments in Australian banks' funding. Reflecting improved market conditions, bond issuance had increased in July, particularly offshore. Activity in the local securitisation market had increased, albeit with continued support from the Australian Office of Financial Management. Members noted that the composition of banks' funding had changed over the past few years, with the share of deposits and long-term debt having increased and funding from short-term debt and securitisation having declined. There had been little change in the cost of deposits in recent months as competition in that sector had stabilised. Short-term wholesale costs had fallen back towards recent average levels but longer-term spreads had increased somewhat, as had cross-currency basis swap spreads. Overall, funding costs were estimated to have risen modestly recently. However, members noted that business lending rates had also continued to rise gradually. The staff assessment was that these developments had resulted in banks' net interest margins declining slightly from their peak a year ago, though they remained above pre-crisis levels. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that sentiment in financial markets had improved over the past month, particularly following the publication of the results of the stress test of the European banking system. Volatility in financial prices nonetheless was still higher than normal. The economic data suggested that the global economy was continuing to expand, though the pace of growth had probably eased since earlier in the year and it was still uneven among regions. Growth remained generally subdued in the North Atlantic countries that had been most affected by the financial crisis, though recent indicators for Europe had been more positive. Growth in the United States had moderated since the start of the year. The Asian region had experienced very strong growth, though it looked now to be slowing to a more sustainable rate. The moderation in growth in the Chinese economy had contributed to some easing in commodity markets, but the prices of Australia's major export commodities were still at very high levels. ", " The major news in the domestic economy had been that underlying inflation had continued to fall, in line with the Bank's expectations, and was now below 3 per cent. Were it not for the effect of the rise in tobacco excise earlier in the year, CPI inflation would have remained below 3 per cent. Employment had continued to grow solidly but consumer spending remained subdued, even though confidence was high. Credit growth remained soft and the housing market had stabilised after the surge in prices late last year and earlier this year. Indicators of business investment remained strong. The staff forecast continued to suggest that GDP growth would strengthen in 2011 and 2012 to above-average rates. Accordingly, even though underlying inflation was expected to remain around 2¾ per cent over the next year, it was forecast to pick up a little thereafter. ", " Over late 2009 and early 2010, the Board had removed the unusual degree of monetary accommodation that had been put in place during the global financial crisis. By May, interest rates on loans to households and businesses had returned to around average levels. In the subsequent two months, with economic growth close to trend and inflation expected to decline to the target range later in the year, the Board had felt comfortable with the existing level of interest rates, particularly in an environment where there was a significant degree of market volatility. ", " Developments over the latest month had not materially changed the Board's assessment. The inflation data released during the month were in line with the Board's expectations for a decline, and the outlook for economic growth had not changed. Markets had settled somewhat, but there was still more uncertainty over the global outlook than there had been earlier in the year. The Board therefore judged the existing level of the cash rate as still appropriate, and decided to leave it unchanged for the time being, pending further information.

This was considered unlikely for as long assubstantial spare capacity remained in labour markets and wages growth remained subdued. Theinternational experience prior to the pandemic had underscored that a sustained period of tightness inlabour markets would be needed in order to generate increases in wages growth, and, even then, wouldput only limited upward pressure on consumer price inflation. Even if wages growth did pick up, it wasalso possible that corporate profit margins in some economies could absorb an increase in labour costsbefore firms passed such costs through to final consumer prices."], "Domestic economic developments": ["Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that employment had continued to recover to be around½ per cent below its pre-pandemic level. Full-time employment had also continued torecover. Much of the increase in employment in preceding months had been in Victoria following theeasing of pandemic-related restrictions there in the December quarter. Nationally, there had been asharp decline in total and average hours worked in January, which reflected more people than usualtaking annual leave in January following unusually low numbers of people taking leave during 2020.Members welcomed the further decline in the unemployment rate to 6.4 per cent in January. Theparticipation rate had remained high in January and, for most age cohorts, participation rates had beennear or above pre-pandemic levels.", "Members noted that the recovery in domestic activity and labour market conditions had continued to besupported by highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The recovery would be further supportedby the rollout of the domestic vaccination program. However, in the near term there was some uncertaintyrelating to the effect that the end of the JobKeeper program would have on labour market conditions.There was limited international experience to draw on in this regard; New Zealand had been the onlycountry to have wound down its wage subsidy program, and very few people had been reliant on it whenthat program ended. Members also noted that a durable recovery from the pandemic would require a strongand sustained pick-up in business investment.", "Members discussed the near-term outlook for the unemployment rate. The end of the JobKeeper program wasseen as unlikely to result in a sustained increase in the unemployment rate. A number of considerationsinformed this assessment. The number of people working zero hours in Australia had declinedsignificantly in recent months to be close to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, some JobKeeperrecipients, including the self-employed, were more likely to suffer a decline in income than loseemployment at the end of the program. Information from liaison contacts had suggested that many firms inreceipt of JobKeeper subsidies had already reduced the size of their workforces and were not planning onanother large round of lay-offs. Against this, it was likely that some jobs that had been maintainedbecause of the wage subsidy provided by JobKeeper would cease when the subsidy ended. Members also tooknote of the increases in forward-looking indicators of labour demand, such as job advertisements andvacancies. These indicators had suggested that the ongoing recovery in labour market conditions could bebroadly sufficient to offset the job losses arising after the end of the JobKeeper program.", "Members noted that wages growth had remained low, at 1.4 per cent over the year to theDecember quarter. Some earlier wage cuts had been reversed sooner than expected, which had boosted wagesgrowth in the December quarter, but this was concentrated in a limited number of industries. Strippingout the effects of temporary pay cuts and their subsequent reversal in the December quarter, wagesgrowth remained very subdued. Indeed, wages growth remained around historical lows in many industries,consistent with there being spare capacity across the labour market. The share of firms in theBank's liaison program with wage freezes in place had remained high, and most firms had continuedto report limited upward pressure on wages despite anecdotal reports of labour shortages in smallsegments of the labour market. Public sector wages growth over the year to December was the lowest onrecord, and was unlikely to pick up noticeably given the caps on wages growth in place. Members agreedthat a materially lower unemployment rate would be needed to generate wages growth in excess of3 per cent, which in turn would be required to ensure inflation was sustainably in the2 to 3 per cent target range.", "Members discussed the uneven recovery in household spending patterns arising during the pandemic.Expenditure on some goods, such as cars, had increased to a higher level than before the pandemic,catching up from an earlier period of weakness. The consumption of other goods, such as householdequipment, had been very strong early in the pandemic, reflecting substitution from servicesconsumption, but was now easing back towards earlier trends. Other types of consumption, including forsome services that had been especially constrained by the restrictions on activity, had returned toaround or a little below pre-pandemic levels, but were unlikely to expand much further in the near term.Members agreed that careful analysis of the different forms of spending would continue to be required toinform assessments of the sustainability of recent trends.", "Members noted that, following the declines in housing prices observed earlier in the pandemic, momentumin the housing market had picked up and price increases had become more broadly based. Price growth andoverall housing conditions had been especially strong in the detached housing sector in outermetropolitan and regional areas. This had partly reflected strong demand from owner-occupiers seekingmore space and from first-home buyers. Advertised rents had also picked up across the country. However,conditions in the apartment rental market in Sydney and particularly in Melbourne had remained subdued,with additional supply still being added to the stock of apartments. Members concurred that housingmarket conditions warranted close monitoring in the period ahead. In particular, it was important thatlending standards remain sound in an environment of rising housing prices and low interest rates.", "Alongside lower interest rates, national housing market conditions had been supported by the recoveryin the labour market and fiscal policy measures that had boosted household income and incentives forhousing construction. Residential building approvals for detached housing had been supported by theAustralian Government's HomeBuilder program and other state-based programs, which would boosthousing supply. However, approvals were expected to decline from high levels in the period ahead asthese stimulus programs were wound down. Once these buildings are completed, there could be asignificant decline in construction activity, particularly given very low population growth. Meanwhile,approvals for high-density housing construction had remained weak and there were few signs of a pick-upin the near term.", "Members noted that unusual population trends during the pandemic had materially affected nationalhousing market conditions and other parts of the economy, and would continue to do so for some time. Netoverseas migration was expected to be negative into 2022, mostly because of the projected sharp declinein the number of foreign students and other temporary residents. As temporary residents typically livein the larger cities, their absence had especially dampened demand for apartments in Sydney andMelbourne. Members also noted data on domestic migration in Australia showing that the population flowfrom capital cities to regional areas had picked up. Net domestic migration to Melbourne had also turnedsharply negative as fewer people moved there during the pandemic. Members agreed that developments innet overseas and domestic migration would continue to affect conditions in the housing market and theeconomy more broadly for a considerable period."], "International financial markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of global financial markets by considering the factors behind therecent rise in sovereign bond yields. Longer-term yields on advanced-economy bonds had increasedsignificantly over preceding months, including for Australia. This had reflected growing optimism aboutthe economic outlook associated with the rollout of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> vaccinations,a decline in <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases in most economies and upward revisions to theexpected size of US fiscal stimulus measures. The more recent rapid rise in yields had been accompaniedby an increase in the volatility of yields and a decline in bond market liquidity, particularly in theUnited States.", "The rise in longer-term government bond yields in advanced economies over preceding months hadpredominantly reflected an increase in compensation for future inflation. Members noted that theincrease in market participants' inflation expectations had been to rates closer to, though nohigher than, central banks' targets, following an earlier period where financial market pricing hadindicated little prospect of inflation targets being met. More recently, there had also been someincrease in real yields in most advanced economies.", "Although central banks had not announced any material changes to their asset purchase plans or guidanceon policy rates since the previous meeting, market participants had brought forward their expectationsfor an increase in policy rates in a number of economies, including Australia. In many advancedeconomies, the first increases in policy rates were expected to occur as early as late 2022, accordingto money market interest rates. Members noted that this change appeared to be sooner than implied bymarket participants' own inflation expectations and the forward guidance from central banks thatthey would not increase policy rates until inflation had increased to be sustainably consistent withtargets.", "Notwithstanding the rise in sovereign bond yields, global financial conditions had remainedaccommodative. Corporate borrowing costs had remained low and equity prices in advanced economies,including Australia, had increased since the start of the year, despite declines late in February.Equity prices had been supported by better-than-expected earnings results and upward revisions tocorporate earnings forecasts over preceding months, consistent with the more positive economic outlook.At the same time, investment flows to emerging markets had remained strong.", "In China, overall funding conditions had remained accommodative. The People's Bank of China hadoverseen a modest tightening in financial conditions in recent weeks, while having emphasised that thisdid not signal a material shift in its policy stance. The Chinese renminbi had appreciated slightlyagainst the US dollar since the start of 2021, and had remained around its highest level since2018.", "Members also discussed the broader topic of China's evolving financial system and its globalimportance. China's policy response to the pandemic had placed more emphasis on avoiding a furtherrise in risks in the financial system compared with responses during earlier downturns. The crisis hadalso placed renewed focus on the authorities' long-running efforts to reconfigure the way thefinancial system supported the economy, with some elements having gradually become more market-basedover recent years. Some investors had incurred losses on investments that they had assumed wereguaranteed by the state. Also, there had been more flexibility in interest rates, capital flows and theexchange rate. Notwithstanding an increase in capital inflows, Chinese financial assets had remained asmall share of foreign investors' holdings of foreign assets. Consistent with this, China'smain influence on international markets continued to be through its large trade flows. Members alsodiscussed how China's role in the global financial system might change in the years ahead. Theynoted that this would be affected by factors such as China's balance of savings relative toinvestment, the speed and extent of further easing in constraints on capital flows, and the extent towhich the renminbi gained wider use in international trade and finance."], "Domestic financial markets": ["Domestically, yields on longer-term Australian Government Securities (AGS) had also increasedsignificantly, and the spread between 10-year AGS and US Treasury yields had widened to around25 basis points. Members noted that the decline in liquidity in the AGS market, while noticeable,had not been as significant as that experienced during the period of market dysfunction in March 2020.Yields on shorter-term bonds had remained anchored, although members noted that there had been someupward pressure on Australian 3-year yields late in February. This had required the Bank to purchasebonds in support of the target for the 3-year Australian Government bond yield of around 10 basispoints, which was for the April 2024 bond. At the same time, yields on the November 2024 bond hadincreased along with the increase in longer-term yields. Market participants had brought forward theirexpectations of an increase in the cash rate, which had also been reflected in the higher yield on theNovember 2024 bond.", "The Australian dollar had appreciated since November 2020 alongside the significant increase incommodity prices. Members noted that this had followed the earlier depreciation of the Australiandollar, much of which appeared to have reflected anticipation of the Bank's package of policymeasures introduced in November 2020. The Australian dollar was assessed as being lower than it wouldhave been otherwise as a result of the Bank's policies.", "The Bank had completed a little over two-thirds of purchases under the initial $100 billion bondpurchase program. Bond purchases under this program had been brought forward in the week leading up tothe meeting to assist with the smooth functioning of the market. The announcement following theFebruary meeting of an additional $100 billion bond purchase program from mid April 2021 had hadlittle lasting effect on yields, which was consistent with this extension already having been reflectedin market pricing.", "Domestically, low funding rates had continued to flow through to banks' funding costs. Somebanks had drawn down further 3-year funding under the Term Funding Facility and many had indicated thatthey planned to draw down their allowances prior to the deadline at the end of June 2021. Also,borrowing rates for households and businesses had declined to new lows. Growth in housing credit hadpicked up a little further in January to be 4¼ per cent on a 6-month-annualised basis.Housing loan commitments had been strong, driven by demand from owner-occupiers. Lending to businesseshad been little changed over the preceding few months, after having decreased over much of the secondhalf of 2020."], "Considerations for monetary policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy hadimproved over prior months. While the path ahead was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, there werebetter prospects for a sustained recovery. Global trade had picked up and commodity prices hadincreased over recent months. Nevertheless, the global outlook remained dependent on responses to thepandemic and the risks of further outbreaks of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> infection, and onthe significant fiscal and monetary support around the world. Inflation remained low and below centralbank targets in many economies.", "Financial markets had responded to the positive news on vaccines and the prospect of furthersignificant fiscal stimulus in the United States. Bond yields had increased considerably over February,including in Australia. This increase partly reflected inflation expectations lifting over the mediumterm to be closer to central bank targets. The changes in bond yields globally had been associated withhigher volatility, though with considerably less spillover to other markets than in March and April2020. The Australian dollar had remained at the upper end of the range of recent years.", "In Australia, the economic recovery was well under way and had been stronger than expected previously.There had been strong growth in employment and a welcome decline in the unemployment rate to6.4 per cent. The December quarter GDP data were expected to show that the recovery remainedon track. An important near-term issue was how households and businesses would adjust to the tapering ofsome fiscal support measures. Members noted that there may be a temporary pause in the pace ofimprovement in the labour market, as many firms had already adjusted the size of their workforces.", "Despite these generally positive developments, members agreed that wage and price pressures had beensubdued and were expected to remain so for several years. The economy had been operating withconsiderable spare capacity and the unemployment rate had remained high. Further progress in reducingspare capacity was expected to occur, but it would take some time before the labour market would betight enough to generate wage increases consistent with achieving the inflation target. There are likelyto be relative price shifts due to changes in the balance of supply and demand during the pandemic, andthe Board would look through these transitory fluctuations in inflation. While annual CPI inflation wasexpected to rise temporarily to 3 per cent around the middle of the year as a result of thereversal of some pandemic-related price reductions, in underlying terms inflation was expected to remainbelow 2 per cent over both 2021 and 2022.", "Members discussed the rate of wages growth that would be needed for inflation to be sustainably withinthe 2 to 3 per cent target range. Assuming ongoing labour-productivity growth and abroadly stable profit share of national income, it was likely that wages growth would need to besustainably above 3 per cent, which was well above its current level. The experience of otheradvanced economies over recent years had suggested that it would take a tight labour market andconsiderable time for higher wages growth to be sustained. The Board's judgement was that wagesgrowth would be unlikely to be consistent with the inflation target earlier than 2024.", "Since the start of 2020, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $175 billion and afurther substantial increase was in prospect. The Bank had recently purchased bonds to support the3-year yield target and would continue to do so as necessary. The Bank was prepared to make furtheradjustments to its purchases in response to market conditions. The Bank had bought a cumulative$74 billion of government bonds issued by the Australian Government and the states and territoriesunder the initial $100 billion bond purchase program. A further $100 billion will be purchasedfollowing the completion of the initial program and the Bank is prepared to do more if that isnecessary. Authorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $91 billion of low-cost fundingthrough the Term Funding Facility and had access to a further $94 billion under the facility.Members noted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, hadremained resilient and was helping to support the economic recovery.", "The Bank's monetary policy settings had continued to help the economy by keeping financing costsvery low, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise, supporting the supply of credit tobusinesses and strengthening household and business balance sheets. Monetary and fiscal policy hadsupported the recovery in aggregate demand and the pick-up in employment. The Board remained committedto doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy, and would maintain stimulatorymonetary conditions for as long as necessary. Members concluded that very significant monetary supportwould be required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's goals for inflationand unemployment were achieved.", "Members discussed the operation of the 3-year yield target, to which the Board remained committed.Later in the year, members would need to consider whether to maintain the April 2024 bond as the targetbond or shift the focus of the yield target to the November 2024 bond. The Board agreed that it wouldnot consider removing the target completely or changing the target yield of 10 basis points. If theBoard were to maintain the April 2024 bond as the target bond, rather than move to the next bond, thematurity of the target would gradually decline until the bond finally matured in April 2024. Inconsidering this issue, members would give close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlookfor inflation and employment.", "Members also discussed the effect that low interest rates have on financial and macroeconomicstability. They acknowledged the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rateenvironment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housingmarket. Members noted that lending standards remained sound and that it was important that they remainso in an environment of rising housing prices and low interest rates. The Board concluded that therewere greater benefits for financial stability from a stronger economy, while acknowledging theimportance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.", "Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long asnecessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will notincrease the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per centtarget range. For this to occur, wages growth would need to be materially higher than it is currently.This would require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board doesnot expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest."], "The decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:"]}},

{"Date": ["Sydney – 4 December 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Wendy Craik AM, Philip Gaetjens, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Gianni La Cava (Senior Research Manager, Economic Research Department)<br> Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that conditions had remained positive, particularly in the major advanced economies, where growth had remained around or above potential and labour markets had continued to tighten. However, growth in a number of economies had slowed this year; softer external demand, at least partly related to trade tensions and the associated uncertainty, had been a common driver of the slowdown. Bilateral US–China trade had contracted following the increase in import tariffs between the two countries, while indicators of external demand, such as new export orders, had softened in the euro area, Japan and other parts of Asia. ", " In the major advanced economies, GDP growth outcomes had diverged further in the September quarter, although there had been some loss of momentum in external demand in all regions. In the United States, growth had remained strong in the September quarter, driven in part by fiscal stimulus. In Japan, the pronounced slowing in year-ended GDP growth had been at least partly the result of disruptions in the wake of natural disasters. One-off factors had weighed on growth in some parts of the euro area, and business conditions and investment intentions there had also declined. ", " Employment growth had remained higher than growth in working-age populations across the major advanced economies and unemployment rates had edged lower from already low levels. Wages growth had continued to increase, but, with the exception of the United States, this had not yet translated into higher inflation in underlying terms. Core inflation had remained below target in the euro area and Japan. Members noted that headline inflation was likely to ease in coming months following the recent decline in oil prices. ", " Members noted that it had continued to be difficult to gauge the underlying momentum in the Chinese economy. Conditions had remained subdued in a number of sectors, including machinery &amp; equipment production and food &amp; clothing. By contrast, the central authorities' direction to local governments to bring forward public spending had contributed to a rebound in infrastructure investment, and the production of construction-related products had strengthened further. Infrastructure investment was expected to continue to support growth in coming months. Growth in investment in the real estate sector had continued to be driven by land purchases. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, surveyed business conditions had remained around average and growth in domestic demand had generally maintained its momentum. However, new export orders had declined and growth in industrial production and export volumes had also eased somewhat in recent months. Growth in the Indian economy had eased in the September quarter, but had remained strong in year-ended terms. ", " The slowing in global trade and concerns about Chinese demand had been reflected in lower commodity prices over preceding weeks. Iron ore prices had followed the recent decline in Chinese steel prices, returning to levels previously seen in mid 2018. Coking coal prices had increased over the previous month despite the fall in steel prices. Thermal coal prices had declined slightly, while prices of rural commodities and base metals had been little changed. ", " Members noted that oil prices had declined by more than 30 per cent since their peak in early October, mainly reflecting recent and prospective increases in global supply. Oil supply from the United States had increased rapidly since the trough in oil prices in early 2016 and was expected to increase further, while production from Saudi Arabia and Russia was expected to be sustained at high levels. Members observed that the nature of US oil production allowed supply flexibility in response to changes in oil prices. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the national accounts for the September quarter would be released the day after the meeting. Based on the partial data that were available, GDP was expected to have increased by more than 3 per cent over the year to the September quarter, above most estimates of potential growth and in line with the most recent set of Bank forecasts. ", " In relation to household consumption, members noted that liaison with retailers suggested that underlying trading conditions had been stable and surveys suggested that households' views about their financial situation had remained around average. ", " Conditions in established housing markets had continued to ease. In Sydney, housing prices had fallen by around 9 per cent since their peak in July 2017, to be around September 2016 levels. In Melbourne, housing prices had returned to levels prevailing around March 2017, having fallen by a little under 6 per cent since their peak in November 2017. Members observed that housing prices had fallen across all price segments in Sydney, but housing prices had been fairly flat at the lower end of the market in Melbourne. Auction clearance rates and indicators of private-treaty activity had also declined a little further in both cities. Housing prices in Perth and Darwin had returned to levels seen a decade earlier. At the same time, price rises were being recorded in some other cities. ", " Preliminary data suggested that dwelling investment had continued around its recent high level in the September quarter. Given the substantial amount of work outstanding and recent data on dwelling approvals, dwelling investment was expected to remain around this level for at least the following year or so before moderating. Liaison with developers indicated that demand for new detached housing in eastern Australia had eased over the previous year or so and some developers had reported that this decline in demand had become more pronounced. Demand for off-the-plan apartments had declined significantly since mid 2017. ", " Partial indicators, including the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) capital expenditure (Capex) survey, suggested that both mining and non-mining business investment had declined in the September quarter. Investment intentions for 2018/19 in the non-mining sector, as reported in the Capex survey, had been revised higher. Members noted that these revised expectations were consistent with surveyed business conditions, which had remained above average, and with the relatively high levels of non-residential building approvals and work yet to be done on non-residential construction projects. ", " Members observed that labour market conditions had continued to improve. Employment had increased solidly in October to be 2.5 per cent higher over the year. This was well above growth in the working-age population and had been driven largely by growth in full-time employment. Leading indicators of labour demand had continued to point to employment growth being above average over the following couple of quarters. The unemployment rate had remained at 5 per cent in October, following the sharp decline in the previous month. Unemployment rates had fallen in almost all states and territories over 2018. In trend terms, the unemployment rates in Victoria and New South Wales were both at their lowest levels in a decade, at around 4½ per cent. Members noted that youth employment (those aged between 15 and 24 years) had increased significantly over the previous year and the youth unemployment rate had declined. ", " Wages growth had picked up a little in the September quarter. The wage price index (WPI) had increased by 0.6 per cent in the September quarter to be 2.3 per cent higher over the year. This pick-up had built on the small, gradual increases in WPI growth recorded over the previous two years. The 3.5 per cent increase in minimum and award wages had contributed to growth in the September quarter. Joint Reserve Bank–ABS analysis suggested that wages growth for jobs covered by the other two wage-setting methods, namely enterprise agreements and individual agreements, had also been stronger than a year earlier. This job-level analysis had also shown that, although there had been little change over the preceding year in the size of a typical wage increase, the share of the workforce receiving an increase in any given quarter had increased. Year-ended growth in the WPI had picked up compared with the previous year across most industries and in all states and territories. ", " Even so, average earnings had increased at roughly the same rate as consumer prices over the previous five years or so, leaving real average earnings relatively unchanged despite moderate productivity growth. This had followed an extended period during the resources boom when real average earnings had consistently risen faster than productivity. As a result, the gap between real average earnings and productivity that had opened up during the resources boom had been largely closed. ", " Members also discussed a paper on some longer-term trends in the division of aggregate income between labour and capital. In Australia, the share of total income paid to workers in wages and salaries (the ‘labour share’) had risen over the 1960s and 1970s but had gradually declined since then. Over the same period, the share of income accruing to profits (the ‘capital share’) had risen. Abstracting from fluctuations associated with the terms of trade cycle, the labour and capital shares had been fairly stable for at least the previous decade. Although the Australian experience appeared to have been similar to that observed in other advanced economies, the factors driving the trends had been somewhat different. Members noted that the long-run increase in the capital share in Australia had stemmed almost entirely from higher profits accruing to financial institutions (since financial deregulation in the 1980s) and from higher rents paid to landlords and imputed to home owners (particularly before the 1990s). Members observed that the increasing use of technology to replace manual effort in the finance sector and long-run increases in the quality and size of homes, as well as a greater number of dwellings per capita, were likely to have contributed to these trends. Members also noted the measurement challenges associated with both financial services and housing services in the national accounts. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting the pick-up in business credit growth in Australia in the second half of 2018. While foreign banks had been the main driver of growth in business lending for some time, the major Australian banks had also made a noticeable contribution to business credit growth in recent months. The pick-up in business lending by the major banks had occurred as growth in their housing lending had continued to slow. Members observed that lending to large businesses had accounted for the bulk of the growth in business credit over preceding years and all of the pick-up in business credit growth in the most recent few months. ", " By contrast, lending by banks to small businesses had increased only modestly over the preceding few years and had been flat in 2018. Moreover, small businesses' perceptions of their access to finance had deteriorated sharply over the year, according to the Sensis survey. Members noted that the Australian Government had recently announced a number of initiatives to support lending to small businesses. ", " Turning to housing credit, members noted that growth in lending to investors had remained very weak and growth in lending to owner-occupiers had continued to ease, to be 5–6 per cent in annualised terms. The slowing in housing credit growth had been almost entirely accounted for by the major banks, where the rate of growth in lending had been the slowest in many years. Housing lending by other financial institutions had continued to grow more strongly. ", " Members observed that the slowing in housing credit growth appeared to reflect both tighter lending conditions and some weakening in demand. On the demand side, declining housing prices in some markets had reduced investor demand. In this context, lenders had continued to compete for borrowers of high credit quality by offering new loans at lower interest rates than those offered on outstanding loans. On the supply side, credit conditions were tighter than they had been for some time. Members noted that the focus on responsible lending obligations in response to the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry was likely to have reduced some lenders' appetite for lending to both households and small businesses. ", " Mortgage interest rates remained low by historical standards, but had risen a little for many borrowers in previous months, as most lenders had passed on the increase in their funding costs resulting from the rise in bank bill swap rates earlier in 2018. ", " Members noted that financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period. ", " Turning to global financial conditions, members noted that financial conditions in the advanced economies remained accommodative, although they had become less so over the course of the year. A few central banks had continued gradually to remove monetary policy stimulus and more recently global equity prices had declined and credit spreads had widened a little (although spreads remained relatively low). ", " Expectations regarding policy paths of the major central banks implied by financial market pricing had been generally little changed over the previous month. However, in the United States the path for the federal funds rate over 2019 implied by market pricing had moved further below that implied by the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' projections published following the September FOMC meeting. Recent public comments by senior Federal Reserve officials had emphasised that further withdrawal of monetary stimulus would increasingly depend on how the economy evolves. ", " Members noted that 10-year government bond yields in major markets had declined in November. In part, this was likely to have reflected the lowering of market expectations for the federal funds rate in 2019, as well as the recent sharp decline in oil prices and some easing in expectations for global economic growth. In the United Kingdom, uncertainty surrounding the approval of a Brexit deal was also likely to have weighed on long-term bond yields. ", " Over the year as a whole, diverging central bank policy paths and economic outlooks had seen bond yields in the United States rise relative to those in Europe and Japan. Consistent with this, the US dollar had appreciated by 5 per cent over 2018 on a trade-weighted basis. ", " Global equity prices had declined in October reflecting a range of factors, including US–China trade tensions, building cost pressures in some countries and a moderation in earnings growth expectations for 2019. Also, equity valuations in the United States had earlier been somewhat elevated. Members noted, however, that the US equity market continued to be supported by strong growth in underlying corporate earnings, with analysts' expectations for earnings growth in 2019 having been revised down only a little recently. In Europe, ongoing concerns about Italian fiscal policy settings, as well as the moderation in growth in the euro area in 2018, had weighed on equity prices, particularly for companies in the financial sector. Chinese equity prices had been declining throughout 2018, although they had not fallen further in November. The decline over the year was likely to have reflected concerns over US–China trade tensions and an easing in growth in economic activity. ", " Members observed that US corporate credit spreads had widened a little recently, although they remained low by historical standards. Members noted that this modest tightening in credit market conditions had occurred against a background of increased corporate leverage, with US non-financial corporations having increasingly sourced funding from securities markets over the preceding decade or so. Issuance of investment-grade bonds and, to a lesser extent, leveraged loans had been strong. Members also observed that securities markets had been increasingly facilitating lending to lower-rated corporations. While Europe and Australia had also seen increases in investment-grade bond financing by corporations, banks remained the predominant source of corporate funding in these markets. ", " Members noted that, although overall corporate leverage in the United States had increased over preceding years, it was not high compared with levels in other economies. Nevertheless, high and rising debt-servicing burdens and the relative increase in debt owed by borrowers of lower credit quality were likely to have increased the vulnerability of the corporate sector to adverse future shocks. On the lending side, the non-bank institutional investors that had recently provided most of the debt financing for corporations tended to have more stable funding and less leverage than banks. Members discussed implications of this for financial stability, given that, by itself, the reduced lending role of banks means that the US financial system would be better placed to withstand a deterioration in credit conditions than in the past. Overall, members agreed that developments in these markets warranted continued monitoring. ", " In China, growth in total social financing had slowed through much of 2018, mostly due to a contraction in non-bank lending, which had previously been a key source of funding for private firms. This followed earlier measures by the authorities to restrict the availability of credit provided by non-bank entities in order to reduce risks in the financial system. By contrast, growth in bank lending, which historically had been disproportionately directed towards state-owned enterprises, had been stable at a solid rate for a number of years. In recent months, the authorities had been taking steps to encourage banks to increase their lending to the private sector (especially smaller enterprises), although members noted that, relative to smaller banks and non-bank lenders, larger banks were less accustomed to lending to this sector. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Globally, the economic expansion had continued, although there had been some signs of a slowing in global trade in the September quarter. In China, the authorities had continued to ease policy in a targeted way to support growth, while paying close attention to the risks in the financial sector. Members noted that balancing these considerations remained a key challenge for the Chinese authorities. Globally, inflation remained low, although wages growth had picked up in economies where labour markets had tightened significantly. Core inflation had picked up in the United States, which had experienced a sizeable fiscal stimulus against the background of very tight labour market conditions, but core inflation had remained low elsewhere. Members noted that the significant fall in oil prices was likely to reduce global headline inflation over the following year or so, should it be sustained. ", " Financial conditions in the advanced economies remained expansionary but had tightened somewhat because of lower equity prices, higher credit spreads and a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar over 2018, as the gradual withdrawal of US monetary policy accommodation had continued. In Australia, there had been a generalised tightening of credit availability. There had been little net growth in credit to small businesses in prior months. Standard variable mortgage rates were a little higher than a few months earlier, while the rates charged to new borrowers for housing were generally lower than for outstanding loans. The Australian dollar remained within its range of recent years on a trade-weighted basis. Australia's terms of trade had increased over recent years, which had helped to boost national income. ", " Members noted that the Australian economy had continued to perform well. GDP growth was expected to remain above potential over this year and next, before slowing in 2020 as resource exports were expected to reach peak production levels around the end of 2019. Business conditions were positive and non-mining business investment was expected to increase. Higher levels of public infrastructure investment were also supporting the economy. The drought had led to difficult conditions in parts of the farm sector. ", " The outlook for household consumption continued to be a source of uncertainty because growth in household income remained low, debt levels were high and housing prices had declined. Members noted that this combination of factors posed downside risks. Notwithstanding this, the central scenario remained for steady growth in consumption, supported by continued strength in labour market conditions and a gradual pick-up in wages growth. The unemployment rate was 5 per cent, its lowest level in six years, and further falls in the unemployment rate were likely given the expectation that the economy would continue to grow above trend. The vacancy rate was high and there were reports of skills shortages in some areas. ", " Conditions in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets had continued to ease and nationwide rent inflation was low. Growth in housing credit was very weak for investors and had also eased for owner-occupiers, reflecting both tighter lending conditions and some softening in demand. Mortgage rates remained low, and competition was strongest for borrowers of high credit quality. ", " Taking account of the available information on current economic and financial conditions, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy would continue to support economic growth and allow for further gradual progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. In these circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate was more likely to be an increase than a decrease, but that there was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress unfolds. Members judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

After a positive reaction to the European Union summit in late October, financial market sentiment deteriorated through most of November, reflecting the difficulty European policymakers were having in dealing with the debt crisis, as well as political instability in several euro-area countries. Sentiment improved again late in the month, however, following the co-ordinated announcement by the major central banks of a reduction in the access price for the US dollar swap lines. ", " The deterioration in sentiment in the early part of the month saw yields on sovereign debt of most euro-area countries rise sharply, particularly in the case of Italy and Spain, but the rises were reversed late in the month. ", " Members noted that European banks would be required to achieve core capital ratios of 9 per cent by mid 2012. It had become evident that, rather than raise new equity capital, a number of banks were seeking to increase their capital ratios by selling assets, particularly assets outside the euro area, and by scaling back trade finance. This risked dampening economic activity. ", " The strains in European interbank markets also intensified in November, with an increasing number of banks effectively shut off from new funding and having to rely instead on the European Central Bank (ECB). Some banks also appeared to be running short of the collateral necessary to obtain funding from the ECB and were undertaking collateral swaps with non-bank institutions or turning to their national central bank. ", " While wholesale debt markets globally appeared to be closed to many financial institutions, non-financial corporations were still able to raise debt. Issuance of corporate debt in the United States had been solid. ", " Global share markets ended November little changed, notwithstanding falls of around 10 per cent in the first part of the month. The Australian dollar had traded in a wide range against the US dollar, generally following movements in the euro. Thin market conditions had contributed to volatility in share markets and exchange rates over recent weeks. ", " Sovereign yields in some countries outside Europe – for example, the United States, United Kingdom and Australia – had fallen to historically low levels. Yields on 10-year government bonds in Australia reached a 50-year low of 3.85 per cent during November. The market for Australian state government debt (semis) had not fared as well, with the spreads between semis and Commonwealth Government debt widening. Nonetheless, yields on semis ended the month lower in absolute terms, and from a historical perspective were quite low. ", " While Australian banks had found long-term debt markets dislocated, there were no signs of strain in local money markets through November and banks had also been able to access short-term offshore markets with relative ease. They continued to be beneficiaries of the shift of US investors away from European bank debt. Deposit growth had also been solid, and well in excess of growth in lending. Two of the four major Australian banks issued covered bonds during the month at spreads that were a little higher than initially expected, mainly reflecting the difficult conditions in funding markets. ", " Members noted that Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P) had been implementing a new framework for bank ratings. As a result, S&amp;P had downgraded the ratings of a number of the world's large financial institutions and, in the days preceding the meeting, had lowered the ratings of the four major Australian banks by one notch to AA-. This had minimal impact on market sentiment toward these banks, given the downgrade had been well anticipated. ", " Following the Board's decision at the November meeting to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points, most indicator interest rates on housing loans and residentially secured small business rates had been lowered by a similar amount. As a result, housing and business lending rates were around their post-1996 average. Looking forward, market expectations were for another reduction in the cash rate at the December meeting, with further reductions anticipated by the middle of the coming year. ", " In other countries, the People's Bank of China had changed its policy direction, lowering banks’ reserve requirement ratios by 50 basis points, after having increased it considerably over the past year. Brazil had also reduced its policy rate target by 50 basis points. In Europe, markets expected the ECB to cut the policy rate at its meeting later in the week. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The recent data for the world economy confirmed the weak state of the euro-area economy, but more positive conditions in other regions. GDP in the euro area had risen by only 0.2 per cent in the September quarter, with Germany accounting for much of the growth that had occurred. Consumer and business confidence had continued to fall. The unemployment rate had been rising gradually over the past six months. Most analysts now expected the European economy to record little, if any, growth in 2012. ", " Members noted that European governments were still looking to craft a full response to their financial problems and that tighter fiscal policy was contributing to weaker near-term growth prospects. They also noted that if these problems were occurring in a single country with its own currency, they could be addressed through some combination of exchange rate depreciation and looser monetary policy, but these options were not available to individual members of a currency union. It remained very difficult to judge how events would ultimately play out in Europe. On the one hand, if recent efforts were successful in moving towards a solution, confidence should improve. On the other hand, a much worse outcome was possible, involving a severe contraction in the European economy, which would have global effects notwithstanding the capacity of the authorities in Asia to apply more stimulatory policies. ", " In contrast to developments in Europe, recent data in the United States had shown a more positive tone than was the case around the middle of the year. Retail sales had been trending higher, with early reports of post-Thanksgiving sales being quite positive. Consumer confidence had improved a little, although it remained low. There had been a gradual improvement in the labour market, with growth in private-sector employment more than offsetting ongoing falls in public employment, and the unemployment rate had fallen recently. The Federal Reserve's latest forecasts were for growth of 2½ per cent or a little higher in 2012. Members noted that if there were no further changes to legislation, a very significant degree of fiscal consolidation would occur in the 2012/13 fiscal year. ", " In Asia, the rate of growth had slowed over recent months, although the region was still expanding solidly. The poor outcomes in Europe were weighing on Asian exports, and growth in domestic demand had moderated somewhat. In China, most of the monthly indicators, including for industrial production and retail sales, were still consistent with solid GDP growth. However, conditions in the housing market were noticeably weaker than over the past couple of years, reflecting the effect of controls on buyers and tight credit supply for developers. Members noted that this slowing was in line with the authorities’ intentions. The slowing in private housing construction was being offset by growth in construction of social housing, but production of crude steel had fallen somewhat in recent months. ", " The Japanese economy expanded by 1.5 per cent in the September quarter, as consumption and exports picked up after the natural and nuclear disasters in March. In contrast, Thailand had been severely affected by flooding, with a large decline in industrial production in October. This was expected to result in a modest disruption to global supply chains. ", " Prices of most exchange-traded commodity prices were broadly unchanged over the past month. Overall, the price indices for rural commodities and base metals were around 15–20 per cent below their peaks earlier in the year. In contrast, spot iron ore prices had risen in November, after falling significantly in October. The general easing in commodity prices had resulted in a decline in inflation pressures in many parts of the world. In China, year-ended inflation had fallen to 5.5 per cent, and a further decline was expected in coming months. Monthly rates of inflation had also moderated in a number of other countries, and the ECB, Bank of England and Federal Reserve were all forecasting significant reductions in inflation over the coming year. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The recent data on the domestic economy had been mixed but, on balance, had been slightly stronger than was the case around the middle of the year. The recently released capital expenditure survey and data for construction work done pointed to very strong growth in business investment. Members noted that while mining-related expenditure was exceptionally strong – estimated to have grown by over 50 per cent over the past year – there were also solid increases in investment in other sectors, including manufacturing. Consistent with the rise in investment, imports of capital goods had been growing particularly strongly over the past year. The capital expenditure survey also confirmed that the investment outlook remained very strong, with a small upward revision to spending plans for 2011/12 from what was an already very positive outlook. There had been further announcements of new iron ore and coal projects over the past month and the expansion of the LNG sector was continuing. ", " The national accounts for the September quarter would be released the day after the meeting. Growth in private demand was expected to be strong, led by business investment. Growth in output, however, was expected to be less than that of demand because of the high import intensity of much of the current investment and the appreciation of the exchange rate. ", " In contrast to the strong capital expenditure data, the value of private non-residential building approvals had remained at a fairly low level over recent months. Residential approvals had continued to decline, with the large fall estimated to have occurred in October in contrast to the recent upward trend in grants to first-home buyers. Approvals in Victoria had fallen significantly in recent months after the sharp run-up through 2010, while housing indicators for New South Wales were showing some signs of a pick-up. In recent liaison, some contacts, including in the property industry, had reported signs of a tightening of credit conditions, and overall growth in business credit outstanding remained weak. ", " Measures of business confidence had, however, generally picked up a little over the past couple of months, after earlier large falls. Measures of current conditions were around average, although large differences continued to be evident across industries. The gradual recovery of coal exports from last summer's flooding was continuing, although the Bureau of Meteorology was reporting an above-average probability of wetter-than-usual conditions this summer. ", " Retail sales had increased at a moderate pace over recent months, after little growth in the June quarter. Surveys suggested that consumer sentiment had also picked up and was now back to a little above its long-run average level, although consumers remained pessimistic about their own finances. Members noted the divergences across different types of household spending, with strength in services but weakness in the value of sales at clothing and department stores. ", " Conditions in the housing market remained subdued. Housing prices were estimated to have fallen in October and were down by around 4 per cent over the year. Members noted that prices had fallen by more in higher-priced suburbs. Housing credit was increasing at an annualised rate of 5–6 per cent, as it had for much of the past year. ", " Employment was estimated to have risen by 10,000 in October and the unemployment rate had declined slightly to 5.2 per cent, which was ¼ percentage point higher than earlier in the year. The various forward-looking indicators continued to point to moderate employment growth, although well below the pace in 2010. Liaison had indicated significant caution in hiring intentions, with firms waiting for evidence of growth in demand before looking to increase staff levels. ", " Liaison also indicated that most firms (outside of those employing specialised skilled labour in the resources sector) expected wage pressures to remain contained. In the September quarter, private-sector wages (as measured in the wage price index) increased by 0.9 per cent, to be 3.7 per cent higher over the year, which was around the average rate of increase since the mid 2000s. In contrast, there was a marked slowing in public-sector wage growth, although this was partly due to delays in reaching new agreements. ", " According to the Australian Government's mid-year budget review, the budget deficit for 2011/12 was expected to be 2.5 per cent of GDP, compared with an estimate of 1.5 per cent of GDP at the time of the May Budget. This increase reflected a combination of factors including lower economic growth, lower-than-expected capital gains tax revenue and changes in the timing of some policy measures. The Government had announced a series of measures in response and was still forecasting a small surplus in 2012/13. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In the global economy, the recent news had been mixed. The data for the US economy had been better than in earlier months. China's growth had been slowing, as policymakers there had intended, and most other economies in Asia had also slowed as trade in Asia was seeing some effects of the significant slowing in economic activity in Europe. Nonetheless, growth rates in Asia remained solid. The news on Europe, however, had been notably weaker and it remained unclear as to how the current situation would be resolved. It seemed highly likely that the sovereign credit and banking problems would weigh heavily on economic activity there over the period ahead, and there was a non-trivial possibility of a very sharp contraction. Global financial markets had experienced considerable turbulence, and financing conditions for banks had become much more difficult, especially in Europe. Overall, members concluded that growth in the world economy was likely to weaken over the coming year. ", " Domestically, some of the recent economic data had been more positive than a few months earlier, and overall growth was consistent with trend. However, conditions varied significantly across sectors. Investment was picking up very strongly, and measures of household and business confidence had improved in recent months, though liaison reports suggested consumers remained cautious. The unemployment rate had been broadly steady, at a little over 5 per cent, after rising around mid year. The financial side of the economy remained relatively subdued, with soft credit growth and declining asset prices. ", " Against this background, the Board considered the question of whether a further reduction in the cash rate would be appropriate following the reduction in November. On the one hand, there had been further evidence that a major investment boom was in progress and the overall economy was expanding at a pace broadly in line with trend. Australia's main trading partners were also still recording solid growth. This did not suggest any strong need to cut interest rates. Against this, developments in Europe continued to pose downside risks to the global economy and, consequently, also to Australia. These risks had, if anything, increased though the timing and magnitude of any effects that might flow from them remained very difficult to predict. ", " In these circumstances, and given the expectation that inflation would be consistent with the target over the next couple of years (abstracting from the effect of the carbon pricing scheme), members felt that there was scope for a modest reduction in the cash rate at this meeting.

It was notedthat should these vaccines prove effective in practice and be made widely available on a timely basis,this would reduce downside risks to the medium-term economic outlook.", "Nevertheless, infections had risen notably in a number of large advanced economies since September.Hospitalisation rates had exceeded earlier peaks in many countries, and stress was being placed on somehealthcare systems. Many governments had responded by tightening containment measures, including there-introduction of full or partial lockdowns. This had contributed to a welcome reduction in the flowof new cases in Europe in recent weeks, while in the United States, where restrictions had been lessstringent, numbers of new cases were yet to slow appreciably.", "Members noted that global economic activity had bounced back faster than anticipated in the Septemberquarter, but the tightening in containment measures in the December quarter had resulted in a loss ofeconomic momentum. In Europe, some economies were now expected to contract in the December quarter.Members observed that, once most restrictions were lifted, the level of GDP in many economies hadtended to recover to around 4 to 5 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. This sizeableshortfall reflected the remaining restrictions on some services industries as well as risk aversion andcost-cutting by firms, which had weighed on employment and investment.", "In Asia, differences in the industry composition of economies explained some of the variation inrecovery paths. Economies with large automotive industries had experienced a slower recovery inindustrial production, compared with those whose exports of technology and electronics are moreimportant. It was also noted that the composition of fiscal stimulus in China had contributed to thevery strong rebound in industrial production there.", "Members noted that housing prices in a number of advanced economies had been surprisingly resilientthis year, and some economies had seen a notable increase in housing prices in recent months. NewZealand had experienced strong ongoing housing demand from population growth, expatriate buyinginterest and an earlier easing in lending standards. By comparison, these factors had been lessrelevant in Australia and, partly as a result, the increase in housing prices in Australia this yearhad been considerably smaller than in a number of other advanced economies.", "Members discussed how global developments had affected Australian trade since the pandemic. Early inthe pandemic, weak external demand had depressed exports, while supply disruptions had affected imports(as they had in a number of economies). The imposition by Chinese authorities of import bans and otherobstacles to imports of some Australian products, particularly agricultural products and, morerecently, coal, had also had an effect. However, it was also noted that Chinese demand for Australianiron ore exports remained firm."], "Domestic economic developments": ["Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that the recovery had established reasonable momentum,aided by the lifting of restrictions in Victoria. Expectations for GDP growth in the September andDecember quarters had been upgraded over the preceding month, and employment had also recovered fasterthan anticipated. At the same time, members noted that there continued to be a significant amount ofspare capacity in the labour market and the economy more generally. The recovery was still expected tobe uneven and protracted, with inflation remaining low. Substantial policy support would therefore berequired for a considerable period.", "In reviewing recent data, members noted that the rebound in household consumption was well under wayand evolving broadly as expected following a record contraction in the June quarter. A bounce-back inspending in Victoria had assisted this, consistent with more consumption possibilities opening up inthat state. Indicators such as retail trade, new car sales and payments information indicated that therecovery in consumption would continue in the December quarter; high household savings was also likelyto support consumption in the period ahead. At the same time, the ability of households to consume someservices would continue to be constrained by pandemic-related restrictions. By the end of the year thelevel of consumption was still expected to be lower than a year earlier, in line with the experience ofsome other economies.", "Members noted that conditions in the domestic housing market were improving but uneven. Regionalhousing prices had increased by more than those in capital cities since the onset of the pandemic.There was also considerable variation in changes in housing prices across the capital cities, withconditions in Sydney and Melbourne more subdued than elsewhere in the country. In addition, withinSydney and Melbourne in particular, conditions in the detached housing market were firmer than forhigher-density markets. Overall, national housing prices had increased only a little since the outbreakof the pandemic.", "Members agreed that an important factor in national housing market conditions had been the slowdownin population growth as a result of the closure of international borders; this had been moreconsequential in Australia than in many other economies. Members discussed how the decline in netoverseas migration had affected conditions in the rental market in particular, with rents falling andrental vacancy rates in inner-city Sydney and Melbourne around their highest levels in many years.Rental vacancy rates were much lower in Perth, where growth in new supply had been relatively modest inrecent years and international students accounted for a smaller share of rental housing demand.", "Members noted that the recovery in the labour market was more advanced than expected, with employmenthaving grown strongly in October. This was despite a tapering in the JobKeeper program and somerestrictions on activity remaining in place in Melbourne during most of the month. Victoria accountedfor around half of nationwide employment growth in October, in part because of the pick-up inemployment in construction and manufacturing in that state as restrictions began to be eased. Relatedto the stronger employment outcomes, members also noted that the rebound in the participation rate hadbeen surprisingly swift.", "Despite these positive developments, members noted that the unemployment rate had ticked up in recentmonths and that broader measures of labour underutilisation remained high. Hours worked were around 4per cent lower than before the pandemic, and many employed workers were still on reduced or zerohours. The recovery in employment and average hours worked for full-time workers had been much moresubdued compared with those working part time. Members agreed that, on the whole, there was still asignificant amount of spare capacity in the labour market and that this would remain a key policychallenge for some time.", "A further indication of spare capacity in the labour market was low wages growth. Members noted thatgrowth in the wage price index slowed to 0.1 per cent in the September quarter to be just1.4 per cent in year-ended terms. This was the slowest wages growth in the two-decade historyof the series. Over recent quarters, the slowdown in growth in wages set in individual agreementslargely reflected wage freezes for many private sector employees and some, mostly temporary, wagereductions. The slowdown in award wages growth in the September quarter had been even more pronouncedthan in individual agreements, in part reflecting deferred increases for many awards. Members alsoobserved that if new collective agreements (mostly enterprise bargaining agreements) were establishedat lower rates of growth than expiring agreements, this would place further downward pressure on wagesgrowth. It was noted that a substantial tightening in the labour market would be required to lift wagesgrowth and inflation outcomes over the medium term.", "Members noted that non-mining business investment was expected to have declined further in theSeptember quarter and the outlook remained weak. Surveys of businesses' investment intentionsindicated that expenditure on machinery and equipment and on non-residential construction would remainweak, although not as weak as expected a few months earlier; investment in machinery and equipmentwould have declined further in the absence of policy measures designed to encourage some firms to bringforward investment. Members discussed the risk that a prolonged period of weak capital investment couldweigh on the economy's productive capacity over time.", "Members concluded their discussion of domestic economic conditions by noting that the unprecedenteddegree of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus since the outbreak of the pandemic had played a key rolein supporting the economy. As part of the national fiscal response, state and territory governments hadrecently announced welcome additional increases in expenditure; this, combined with lower revenues, hadseen the consolidated state and territory budget deficit for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> increase to around 5 per cent of output. The consolidateddeficit across the Australian and state governments in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> wasexpected to be around 15 per cent of GDP, a substantial increase from <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span>. Members agreed that national fiscal settings will provide significantsupport to the recovery in the period ahead."], "International financial markets": ["Members observed that financial conditions were highly accommodative globally. News of progress indeveloping effective vaccines had boosted equity markets and had lowered credit risk premiums furtherduring November, notwithstanding rising <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> case numbers and tighterlockdown measures in many jurisdictions.", "In the advanced economies, expectations for any further reductions in central banks' policy rateshad been scaled back, partly because of upward revisions to the economic outlook and partly becauseother policy tools were providing significant stimulus and could be scaled up if needed. At its mostrecent policy meeting, the US Federal Reserve had judged that immediate adjustments to the pace andcomposition of its asset purchases had not been necessary. The European Central Bank had signalled thatit was likely to expand some of its programs at its upcoming meeting, but a further reduction in itsnegative policy rate was no longer anticipated by market participants. The Bank of England had announcedan expansion of its asset purchase program in November and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand hadintroduced a program for providing long-term loans to banks. In contrast to previous months, marketpricing had suggested that negative policy rates were unlikely to be adopted in either of these twoeconomies.", "Yields on long-term government bonds in the advanced economies had risen a little in response to thepositive news on <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> vaccines, but had remained at very low levels.Central bank bond buying programs had provided some offset to the effect on yields stemming from otherinfluences, including the ongoing high level of government bond issuance. Members noted that, relativeto GDP, the size of the Bank's balance sheet was at the lower end of the range observed in othercountries, although it was now rising steadily under the bond purchase program that had commenced inNovember.", "Members noted that a range of asset prices had been supported by the more positive global outlook andthe very accommodative stance of monetary policy. Spreads between corporate and government bond yieldshad narrowed further. Globally, equity prices had increased strongly following the vaccine developments,rising by at least 10 per cent in many cases, including in Australia. A reduction inuncertainty following the outcome of the US election, and better-than-expected earnings reports inadvanced economies, had also supported equity prices.", "Chinese government bond yields had increased and the Chinese renminbi had appreciated in recent months.Relatively higher interest rates and China's recent inclusion in some global benchmark indices hadencouraged continued inflows into Chinese bond markets. Also, Chinese authorities had continued toimprove foreign access to these markets. Reflecting the better outlook for global growth and trade, manyemerging market economies had experienced significant portfolio inflows and appreciating exchangerates.", "The US dollar had depreciated during November in response to the improved medium-term outlook forglobal growth; on a trade-weighted basis it was a little below its level at the start of 2020. The samefactors had supported commodity prices and seen the Australian dollar appreciate in November; on atrade-weighted basis the exchange rate had remained around 2 per cent below its peak in earlySeptember."], "Domestic financial markets": ["Members noted that the most recent policy package had been working as expected. Money market rateshad declined to be close to zero and the yield on the 3-year Australian Government bond had fallen tolevels consistent with the Board's target, aided by the Bank purchasing $5 billion of thatbond in November. In addition, $19 billion of longer-dated government bonds had been purchasedunder the bond purchase program.", "The bond purchase program had put downward pressure on bond yields and contributed to a lowerexchange rate than otherwise. Yields on 10-year Australian Government Securities (AGS) had declinedrelative to 10-year government bond yields in other advanced countries in anticipation of theBank's bond purchase program. Since the announcement of the program, yields on 10-year AGS hadremained at similar levels to those on 10-year US Treasury securities. The spread of semi-governmentbond yields relative to AGS had increased a little following the release of the state governmentbudgets, but yields had remained at historically low levels. The markets for AGS and semi-governmentdebt had continued to function smoothly.", "Members observed that average outstanding interest rates on housing and business loans had declinedto historic lows. Since the start of November, announcements of reductions in borrowing rates hadlargely been for fixed-rate housing loans as well as business loans under the Government'sCoronavirus Small and Medium Enterprises Guarantee Scheme. Some banks had also reduced rates on a rangeof deposit products.", "Demand for housing finance had increased in recent months, particularly for loans to owner-occupiers,and credit to investors had stopped declining. Members noted that, in contrast, demand for businesscredit had remained weak and business credit had declined since May, unwinding the increase over Marchand April, when businesses had drawn on credit lines for precautionary reasons. Payments into offsetand redraw accounts had remained high in October."], "The future of money": ["Members considered a special paper on the future of money and changes in the way payments are made.They discussed the longer-term trend towards the use of electronic payment methods by households and theapparent acceleration in this trend as a result of the pandemic. Members noted that the shift from cashto electronic payments is further advanced in Australia than in a number of other countries. However,demand for cash as a store of value had continued to grow in Australia and most other advancedeconomies.", "Members discussed different possible design features for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC)and the associated public policy issues. They noted that there has been significant innovation in theAustralian payments system in recent years, including the provision of real-time account-to-accountpayments that are available on a <span class=\"no-wrap\">24/7</span> basis. A retail CBDC mightassist with some particular use cases, but it could fundamentally change the structure of the financialsystem and introduce new financial stability risks. It therefore did not appear that a public policycase for a retail CBDC currently existed in Australia. Members noted that there could be strongerarguments in favour of a wholesale CBDC and that it was important for the Bank to continue to conductresearch in this area and monitor developments in other jurisdictions."], "Considerations for monetary policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global outlook remained uncertain.Infection rates had risen sharply in Europe and the United States and the recoveries in these economieshad lost momentum or even reversed. However, the news about vaccines had been positive, which shouldsupport the recovery of the global economy. The recovery was also dependent on ongoing support from bothfiscal and monetary policy. In labour markets in most countries, hours worked were noticeably belowpre-pandemic levels. Inflation remained very low and below central bank targets.", "In Australia, the economic recovery was under way and recent data had generally been better thanexpected. Consumer spending had risen as restrictions were eased, business and consumer confidence hadlifted and housing markets had generally proved resilient. Employment had been recovering strongly andthe peak in the unemployment rate was likely to be lower than the 8 per cent rate expected amonth earlier. Nevertheless, the recovery was still expected to be uneven and protracted, and itremained dependent on significant policy support and favourable health outcomes. It would take some timefor output to reach its pre-pandemic level and an extended period of high unemployment was in prospect.The high unemployment rate and excess capacity across the economy more broadly were expected to resultin subdued wages growth and inflation over coming years. Given this environment, the Board viewedaddressing the high rate of unemployment as an important national priority.", "Following the significant policy changes made at the Board's recent meetings, members decided tomaintain the existing policy settings. Members agreed that the Board's policy measures had loweredinterest rates across the yield curve, which was assisting the recovery by: lowering financing costs forborrowers; contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise; and supporting asset prices and balancesheets. The Term Funding Facility (TFF) was also supporting the supply of credit to businesses. TheBoard's decisions were complementary to the significant steps taken by governments in Australia tosupport jobs and economic growth.", "Since the start of the year, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $130 billion.Authorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $84 billion of low-cost funding through theTFF and had access to a further $105 billion under the facility. Over the preceding month, the Bankhad purchased $19 billion of government bonds under the bond purchase program and a further$5 billion of AGS in support of the 3-year yield target. The Bank remained prepared to purchasebonds in whatever quantity required to achieve the 3-year yield target. Members noted that theAustralian banking system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and washelping the economy traverse the current difficult period.", "Given the outlook for both employment and inflation, members acknowledged that monetary and fiscalsupport will be required for some time. The Board remains committed to not increasing the cash rateuntil actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For thisto occur, wages growth would have to be materially higher than recent levels. This would requiresignificant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. Given the outlook, the Board doesnot expect to increase the cash rate for at least 3 years. The Board remains of the view that itwould be appropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself were increased.", "Members agreed to keep the size of the bond purchase program under review. At its future meetings, theBoard will closely monitor the effects of the bond purchases on the economy and on market functioning,as well as the evolving outlook for jobs and inflation. The Board is prepared to do more ifnecessary."], "The decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:"]}},

In China, growth looked to have been a bit stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half and, for 2013, was likely to be around, or even a little above, the government's 7. 5 per cent target. House prices and transaction volumes had increased further in recent months and most indicators of activity had remained strong. The net flow of financing declined in October from its high levels in the previous two months. While these data tend to be quite volatile, the lower flow was consistent with efforts to place financing on a more sustainable footing. The Chinese leadership had recently outlined its reform priorities for coming years, with various initiatives to deregulate prices, pursue land reform and liberalise the financial sector, among others. ", " In Japan, growth in economic activity in the September quarter was slower than in the first half of the year, but it was still a bit stronger than had been expected. Consumer prices were no longer declining and core inflation was positive. Economic activity in much of the rest of east Asia had continued to expand at around its decade-average pace. ", " The latest indicators for the US economy were consistent with some improvement in output growth through the year, driven primarily by private domestic demand. Labour market conditions had also improved somewhat. Recent data for the housing market had been mixed, but were consistent with further growth in dwelling investment. Economic conditions in the euro area appeared to have improved to some extent, with signs of stabilisation in some of the crisis economies and activity for the region as a whole increasing marginally in the September quarter. ", " Global commodity prices overall had not changed much since the previous Board meeting. Spot prices for both iron ore and thermal coal were little changed following earlier increases, while coking coal and base metals prices had drifted lower and oil prices were higher. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Labour market conditions had remained soft, with the level of employment flat since around the start of the year. While the unemployment rate had been little changed since the middle of the year, the participation rate had declined noticeably over the same period. Members noted that the ageing of the population and soft labour market conditions, which reduced the incentives to search for a job, had both contributed to the decline in the participation rate over the past two years or so. With employment growth well below population growth, the ratio of employment to the working-age population had fallen. In contrast, aggregate hours worked had continued to rise at close to trend pace, suggesting ongoing growth in labour demand. There had also been some tentative signs of a stabilisation in forward-looking indicators of labour demand – including reports from liaison of a slight improvement in employment intentions – although these remained at low levels. ", " The wage price index rose by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter, a little less than had been expected. The increase in wages of 2.7 per cent over the year was lower than the average growth rate over the past decade. Members observed that, with prices of tradable items no longer declining, the decline in wage growth over the past year would help keep inflation consistent with the medium-term target. Business surveys and liaison suggested that wage pressures were likely to remain modest in the period ahead. ", " Members were informed that the national accounts, scheduled for release the day after the Board meeting, were expected to show that output growth remained a bit below trend. ", " Business investment appeared to have risen in the September quarter after declining in the previous two quarters. Looking ahead, business investment intentions reported in the latest ABS capital expenditure survey were similar to those from the reading three months earlier, and were consistent with little change in 2013/14 in that part of non-mining investment covered by the survey. However, non-mining investment not covered by the survey was expected to show some growth over 2013/14, most notably in the health industry. The survey still pointed to an increase in the level of mining investment in 2013/14, although members noted that the capital expenditure survey tends to be a less accurate guide to future mining investment than it is for the non-mining components surveyed. In contrast to the capital expenditure survey, public statements by mining companies and information from the Bank's liaison suggested that mining investment would be likely to decline over the period ahead. ", " Survey measures of business conditions improved a little further in October. Business confidence was also higher than it had been earlier in the year, although it fell to around long-run average levels in October following a sharp rise in September. ", " The recent trade data showed further growth of resources exports, notably for iron ore, while services exports had increased, consistent with evidence from liaison of some improvement in prospects for tourism and education exports. ", " Household consumption growth looked to have remained a bit below average in the September quarter, but conditions appeared to have picked up a little since then. Retail sales growth was higher in the three months to October than around the middle of the year. While information from liaison suggested that this strength may not have been carried through to November, some retailers appeared to be more optimistic ahead of the Christmas trading period. Motor vehicle sales to households had fallen in September and October but they were at a high level overall, and consumer sentiment remained above average. ", " Forward-looking indicators suggested that dwelling investment would pick up in the period ahead, even though data on work done pointed to a modest decline in measured new dwelling investment in the September quarter. Dwelling approvals had increased in all states over recent months and first home owner grants for new dwellings had been rising, following the redirection of state government incentives for first home buyers towards new construction. Conditions in the established housing market had strengthened further. Housing prices had increased at an annualised rate of 15 per cent over the past six months, with the largest increases in Sydney, but prices in other cities had also picked up over recent months and auction clearance rates remained well above average. Loan approvals increased significantly in September and October, to be about 20 per cent higher over the year. In line with this, housing credit growth had been edging higher, especially for investors. "], "Financial Markets": [" Board members began their discussion of financial markets with a brief review of the changes to the Reserve Bank's balance sheet resulting from the implementation of new liquidity arrangements provided to exchange settlement (ES) account holders involved in the settlement of direct entry payments. Since these payments could now be settled for same-day value – including during periods when the interbank cash market was closed – ES account holders now held sufficient buffers of liquidity to enable them to meet these late-day payments. ES account holders had established open-ended repurchase agreements with the Bank worth an aggregate $21 billion, mainly through the sale of self-securitised assets. This change had increased both sides of the Bank's balance sheet by that amount: the Bank's liabilities rose because banks now held higher ES balances, while assets increased since these balances had been funded by banks borrowing from the Bank under repurchase agreements. ", " Turning to central bank policy settings, members discussed the European Central Bank's 25 basis point cut in its main refinancing rate to 0.25 per cent at its meeting in early November, in response to inflation remaining below target. They noted that stronger economic data for the United States had again focused attention on when the Federal Reserve would start to unwind its highly expansionary policy settings. The consensus view within financial markets remained for a ‘tapering’ of the Fed's asset purchases to commence in March. The Fed had continued to emphasise that this move need not presage a near-term increase in the policy rate and, reflecting this, US money market prices currently implied no increase in the policy rate until late in 2015. ", " The stronger economic data in the United States had also contributed to higher long-term bond rates in most markets. Yields on 10-year US government bonds rose by around 25 basis points over the month. Members noted that sovereign bond yields in emerging markets generally rose during November, with economies that had previously been sensitive to concerns about a change in Fed policy – including Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey – the most affected. ", " In the domestic market, the yield curve for Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS) was extended by the inaugural issue of a 20-year nominal bond, which had been well subscribed. Official data showed that non-resident investors purchased around 60 per cent of the issue, with foreign central banks accounting for nearly half of the offshore demand. ", " Members observed that bond issuance by Australian banks had picked up in November with a total of $17 billion raised. Most of the issuance was in offshore markets and it was mainly in unsecured form. Over the month, spreads on major banks' senior unsecured and covered bonds were little changed and, relative to CGS yields, had remained at around their lowest level since the onset of the global financial crisis. In aggregate, the four major banks recorded solid profit results in the half year to September. ", " Share markets mostly increased in the major economies over November, with the US S&amp;P 500 reaching a new all-time high and the Nikkei rising to its highest level since December 2007. In contrast, the Australian share market was little changed. Its underperformance relative to most other developed markets was a reflection of both the weaker performance and larger size of the resources sector in Australia. Equity prices in many of the emerging markets had also been somewhat weaker over the past month. ", " Members noted that the generally stronger US data recently had also contributed to an appreciation of the US dollar against most currencies during November, with the pound sterling a notable exception. There was a small depreciation of the euro, although it remained at a relatively high level, while the Japanese yen had depreciated further notwithstanding stronger economic data in Japan, as the Bank of Japan continued to expand the money base rapidly. The Australian dollar had also depreciated noticeably over the past month; on a trade-weighted basis, the exchange rate was about 13 per cent below its peak in April, although still slightly above the lows reached in August. ", " Money market pricing in Australia at the time of the meeting indicated that no change was expected in the cash rate in either direction in the near term. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that Australia's major trading partners as a group appeared to have been growing at close to the long-run average rate over the second half of this year. Recent data suggested that growth of the Australian economy had remained a bit below trend over the second half of the year. Business investment had risen in the September quarter, but mining investment was likely to decline over the next few years and while other areas of business investment could be expected to increase from current very weak levels, that would take time. Resources exports were rising as the production phase of the resources boom gathered pace. While dwelling investment had reportedly declined in the September quarter, a range of indicators pointed to growth in the period ahead. Consumption spending was growing at a moderate pace. Overall, growth of the economy was expected to continue at a below-trend pace over the next year, picking up thereafter. ", " At recent meetings, the Board had judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate while continuing to gauge the effects of the substantial degree of monetary policy stimulus that had already been put in place. There had been further signs of the stimulatory effects of low interest rates, most notably in the housing market, and additional effects were still likely to be coming through. At the same time, inflation remained within the target. While the exchange rate had depreciated over the month, members agreed that it remained uncomfortably high and a lower level would likely be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy. ", " The Board's judgement remained that, given the substantial degree of policy stimulus that had been imparted, it was prudent to hold the cash rate steady while continuing to gauge the effects of earlier reductions, but not to close off the possibility of reducing it further should that be appropriate to support sustainable growth in economic activity, consistent with the inflation target. The Board would continue to examine the data over the months ahead to assess whether monetary policy remained appropriate.

Conditions had changed abruptly in a very short period. While growth was still positive in the emerging economies, it had been slowing significantly, notably in China. Members noted that the latest IMF forecasts released during November had again reduced the forecast for world economic growth in 2009. The three major economies were now forecast to contract and growth for the world as a whole had been revised down to 2.2 per cent, from 3.9 per cent forecast only a few months earlier. Members discussed the significant measures by several governments to provide a large fiscal stimulus to their economies in the year ahead. ", " Turning to individual economies, recent indicators suggested that economic conditions in the United States had deteriorated further in the past few months. The labour market had continued to weaken. Housing starts were still falling and the current level of starts was well below 1 million. The very low level of activity meant that the stock of unsold houses was being wound back; however, house prices were still falling. ", " Consumer spending in the United States had fallen in real terms in each of the five months to October. Although real disposable income had been boosted by the package of tax rebates in the June quarter, this had had only a small effect in slowing the downward trend in spending. As a result of the economic slowdown and falls in commodity prices, US consumer prices, having reached a peak growth rate of 5½ per cent on a year-ended basis, were now falling. The core measure of inflation, which excluded the direct effects of higher oil and food prices, was now at 2.2 per cent. ", " In Japan, GDP had fallen slightly in the September quarter, following a fall of almost 1 per cent in the previous quarter. More recent information suggested that activity had since deteriorated, but members observed that lower prices of oil and other commodities would help to cushion the slowdown. ", " Industrial production in China had weakened further. The current year-ended growth rate of 8 per cent was similar to rates that had been typical a number of years ago, but well down from the 15–20 per cent pace seen over the past five years. Declines in production were occurring in some areas, notably steel and electricity. ", " In other parts of east Asia there had been a similar slowing in activity, compounded by weaker external demand. No growth in aggregate output had been recorded in the third quarter, and year-ended growth had fallen to 3½ per cent, which was down from over 6 per cent in the second half of 2007. ", " Economic growth in the euro area had been negative in both the second and third quarters. Sentiment indicators for consumers and businesses were still falling, to be at their lowest levels since the early 1990s. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members were briefed that, with the national accounts for the September quarter scheduled for release the day after the meeting, the staff estimate was for a flat GDP outcome in the quarter, based on the partial data released to date. Recent indicators suggested that economic activity had remained subdued in the early part of the December quarter. ", " Members then considered in detail the information provided by the run of regular data releases, covering the household, housing and business sectors, commodity prices, the labour market, and prices and wages. ", " The slowing in domestic demand to date had been led by household spending. The volume of retail sales increased only slightly in the September quarter, following two quarters of small declines. According to data that were released during the meeting, retail sales rose by 0.7 per cent in October. However, the more reliably measured sales of large retailers increased only slightly in October and the staff's liaison with retailers suggested that conditions may have weakened further in the past month or so. Members observed that retail sales were considerably weaker in New South Wales than in the rest of Australia, and this was seen in other economic indicators also. Another indicator of household consumption was motor vehicle sales. These had fallen considerably over the past year. Consumer sentiment had remained relatively low in November. Members were updated on developments in household net worth, which had fallen by 11 per cent over the past year. ", " Turning to the housing sector, the data on housing loan approvals and housing credit growth had picked up a little in the past two months after slowing sharply in the first half of the year. But activity in the sector remained subdued. Building approvals data suggested that residential construction was trending down, though the current level of activity was already running well below estimates of underlying demand for housing. In the established housing market, conditions were also subdued. However, there were some indications that house prices were levelling out after falling in the September quarter. ", " Members were informed that business investment was estimated to have been broadly flat in the September quarter, but had expanded by about 10 per cent over the past year. Looking forward, year-ahead investment intentions of businesses for 2008/09, reported in the ABS capital expenditure survey, were about 20 per cent higher in nominal terms than they had been this time last year for 2007/08, though there had been some scaling back of investment plans recently. Members thought the surprising strength of investment expectations partly reflected the very long-term nature of many large investment projects. However, they noted that private-sector surveys had suggested a more pronounced scaling back of investment intentions in the past few months. ", " Business debt funding had picked up a little over recent months after slowing in the first half of the year. It was now running at just under 10 per cent on an annualised basis, compared with the unusually high rate of 20 per cent at the end of last year. Members noted that the slowing since last year was significantly less than that in the early 1990s episode. At present, current borrowing was mainly intermediated finance. Broadly consistent with the credit data, commercial loan approvals now appeared to be levelling out, after having fallen earlier in the year. ", " Indications from business surveys were that business conditions had continued to soften over recent months, and business confidence had fallen to a very low level, which was not surprising given the financial market disruption in recent months. ", " Members then turned to an assessment of recent developments in commodity prices. Oil prices had been falling since July and were now below US$50 per barrel for Tapis crude; they had fallen by 20 per cent over the past month. The oil price had also fallen markedly in Australian dollar terms. Spot prices for bulk commodity exports were trading well below the latest contract prices, though members noted there had been little sales activity in the spot markets. From a longer-run perspective, bulk commodity prices were still running ahead of levels of a few years earlier. Weaker commodities demand, particularly from China, was also starting to affect resource export volumes, particularly for iron ore. In this environment, freight rates had fallen very rapidly, more than unwinding the rise over the past two years. ", " In reviewing conditions in the labour market, members noted that employment had held up well in the past few months, and the unemployment rate had been relatively steady. However, the trend in employment growth was slowing. Indicators of future growth in employment were weakening more sharply; the number of jobs advertised on the internet and in newspapers was falling and business surveys indicated lower hiring intentions. Members acknowledged that these data suggested unemployment was likely to rise in the period ahead. ", " Turning to developments in wages and prices, wage growth appeared to have been firm but stable during the September quarter. The wage price index had increased by 0.9 per cent in the September quarter, keeping the year-ended rate of growth steady at a little over 4 per cent. Liaison with firms suggested that more moderate growth in wages was likely in the year ahead, in line with the easing in labour demand that was in prospect. ", " Members noted that inflation expectations had moved up significantly around the middle of the year, but had since fallen back to be at the lower end of the range of the past few years. This movement, which was reflected in a similar pattern in the measure of inflation expectations derived from the bond market, was likely to have been influenced by movements in oil and other commodity prices. The December quarter CPI outcome was expected to be held down noticeably by the fall in global oil prices, with retail petrol prices expected to subtract around ¾ percentage point; the March quarter CPI would also be reduced if current petrol prices were sustained. The staff forecast was that underlying inflation had peaked, and it was expected to return to near the centre of the target band by mid 2011. CPI inflation was likely to fall more quickly in the short term as a result of the recent falls in petrol prices, with this measure of inflation likely to fall below 2½ per cent by the middle of next year. "], "Financial Markets": [" Financial markets had remained unsettled in November. Board members discussed the main developments in the United States during the past month, which included support programs for a number of major financial institutions and a shift on the part of the Federal Reserve to provide more direct financial assistance to the housing sector. These measures were aimed at reducing mortgage rates, which had remained high since the onset of the financial crisis despite the significant reduction in the federal funds rate. In response to the various assistance measures, US mortgage rates had shown some signs of falling recently. ", " There had been a significant easing in monetary policy in several industrial economies over the past month. The European Central Bank reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points to 3.25 per cent and the Bank of England had lowered rates by 150 basis points to 3 per cent. Notwithstanding these policy moves, markets expected substantial easing in monetary policy by both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England at their next policy meetings. The Swiss National Bank had reduced rates by 150 basis points at its past two meetings. ", " Looking forward, the Federal Reserve was expected to reduce the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at its meeting in December, which would take the rate to 50 basis points. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand was expected to lower rates by about 100 basis points at its next meeting. ", " Members were briefed that in many countries the reductions in official interest rates had only a relatively small impact on the interest rates charged by lenders. In contrast, recent reductions in the official cash rate in Australia had resulted in substantial reductions in bank lending rates, particularly for housing. ", " There had also been a large monetary policy easing in China during the past month, as part of measures adopted by the Chinese Government to stimulate the economy. ", " Money market spreads in major markets had narrowed over the past month, but activity in interbank markets had been limited. Year-end pressures were emerging, which meant that spreads had begun to widen somewhat in the days preceding the meeting. However, the level of money market yields had fallen sharply given the reductions in benchmark short-term policy rates. Government bond yields had also fallen. These yields were now at post-War lows in many countries and were allowing governments to borrow at low cost. ", " US corporate spreads had narrowed somewhat at the high-quality end of the spectrum, but had continued to widen for lower-quality bonds, which meant that borrowing costs for lower-rated corporations were very high. Spreads in emerging markets had widened. ", " Debt issuance had gradually increased, but remained at very low levels. Issuance by banks using government guarantees had commenced in a number of countries. UK banks had issued the most paper to date. Members noted that the details of the Australian scheme had been made public during the month, and the first issue under the guarantee was expected to occur shortly. ", " Global equity markets had continued to be volatile over the month. In net terms, most markets had fallen further, including a significant fall on US markets on 1 December. US and European markets generally were now back at the levels of the mid to late 1990s. Volatility in the Australian equity market remained high, though less so than that in the US over the past month. The Australian market was back at the levels prevailing in 2004. ", " Turning to foreign exchange markets, members observed that exchange rates had also remained volatile over the past month, though less so than in the previous two months. The US dollar had been mostly unchanged, but was about 20 per cent above its low point in trade-weighted terms. The Chinese currency had appreciated in effective terms. Although it was flat against the US dollar, euro and yen in net terms, the exchange rate had appreciated strongly against the currencies of China's Asian trading partners. Members noted that the 1 per cent depreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar on 1 December was the largest daily move under the current framework. ", " Over the month, the Australian dollar had been volatile but little changed in net trade-weighted terms. The exchange rate had fallen by about 20 per cent over the past year. Members discussed the volatility of the Australian dollar exchange rate and its correlation with the US equity market during the last two hours of trading in New York. When conditions in the foreign exchange market had been especially thin on some occasions over the month, the Bank had again intervened to provide liquidity by buying Australian dollars, though the scale of the intervention had been less than in the previous month. ", " Members noted that Australian money market yields had fallen considerably over the past month, following the reduction in the cash rate, and further falls in short-term rates were expected. Longer-term Australian government bond yields had also fallen sharply over that period, in line with movements in yields globally. Although the spreads between semi-government securities to Commonwealth Government securities had risen somewhat, the overall borrowing costs for the States had nonetheless fallen noticeably. ", " Members noted that expectations were for a major easing in the official cash rate at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The Governor proposed that members consider a substantial reduction in the cash rate. ", " The backdrop to members' policy discussion this month included the further evidence of slowing in the world economy, with conditions becoming appreciably worse in the past couple of months. The latest IMF and private-sector forecasts were suggesting that growth in both the developed and emerging economies in 2009 would be significantly lower than thought only a few months earlier. ", " Recent actions by a number of governments and central banks to stabilise their respective financial systems were beginning to take effect, but financial market sentiment remained fragile and evidence of weak economic conditions in the major economies and a significant slowing in many emerging economies was still accumulating. ", " Although the Australian economy had been more resilient than other industrial economies, recent data indicated that a significant moderation in demand and activity had been occurring. With confidence affected by the financial turbulence and a decline in the terms of trade now under way, members thought that more cautious behaviour by both households and businesses would result in private demand remaining subdued in the near term. Given these circumstances and the associated easing in capacity pressures, there would be downward pressure on inflation in Australia over the year ahead. Global disinflationary forces were likely to assist in this regard, though members acknowledged that the depreciation of the exchange rate meant the decline of inflation to the target could take longer than would otherwise have been the case. ", " Members agreed that it was appropriate to shift the monetary policy setting from its current roughly neutral position to one that was clearly expansionary. The Board saw a need for the reduction in the cash rate, and bank lending rates, to be large enough to have a noticeable effect on financing decisions of lenders and borrowers. Members also took account of the fact that a Board meeting was not typically scheduled in January, given that local markets tended to be relatively thin over the summer break and statistical and survey data, as well as liaison information, were less timely. Overall, members judged that the two-month break between meetings was one consideration in favour of a substantial reduction in interest rates at this meeting. ", " Accordingly, members felt that, on this occasion, a reduction of 100 basis points was appropriate and would contribute to supporting confidence among households and businesses. In particular, a reduction of this size would move monetary policy quickly to an expansionary setting. Given trends in money market yields, the Board expected that most lending rates would fall significantly. ", " Members observed that, with the decision at this meeting, there had been a major easing in monetary policy over the past few months. They considered that the setting of monetary policy, combined with the spending measures announced by the Government, which were soon to take effect, and the large depreciation of the Australian dollar amounted to significant stimulus that would support demand over the year ahead. The size of the response to date was judged to be such that a period of assessment of local and overseas events was warranted over the summer. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 100 basis points to 4.25 per cent, effective 3 December. "]}},

GDP data were now available for the September quarter for a wide range of economies and indicated that most advanced economies were now growing again, although uncertainty remained about the strength and durability of the expansion once the positive effects of the inventory cycle and policy stimulus began to ease. GDP growth had been quite strong outside the G7 economies in the September quarter, following a similar outcome in the June quarter, with particular strength in Asia. This was contributing to increases in commodity prices and firmer demand for Australian resources exports. ", " Despite the resumption of growth, there remained significant spare capacity in the advanced economies as evidenced by the high levels of unemployment and low levels of measures of capacity utilisation. Some economies, including the United States and United Kingdom, had seen relatively modest declines in inflation so far, although the extent of the contraction in economic activity that had occurred suggested that further disinflation was likely. There had been much larger declines in inflation in some Asian economies with relatively flexible labour markets, and also in some advanced economies, most notably Ireland and Spain, where initial inflation rates had been higher and where there had been larger contractions in activity. ", " Developments in the United States continued to suggest a gradual improvement in conditions. Although household spending in the September quarter had been boosted by the incentives for car purchases, other components of consumption had also shown modest growth, and the contraction in business investment had slowed. Indicators of activity in the housing market continued to suggest a stabilisation. While the unemployment rate had continued to rise, a number of other indicators suggested that the deterioration in the labour market was easing. ", " In the euro area, positive growth had been recorded in the September quarter, with Germany, France and Italy all recording growth but the Spanish economy continuing to contract. However, growth thus far appeared to be mostly driven by exports and the inventory cycle, with private demand still weak. Household spending was continuing to contract, with retail sales around 4 per cent lower over the past two years. ", " Most economies in Asia were expanding solidly. In China, while there had been a slowing in investment spending after the very rapid growth seen earlier in the year, growth in retail spending had been strong recently. Chinese export volumes were also rising at a solid rate, with broad-based growth to a range of destinations. Growth in Indian GDP in the September quarter had been very strong, and the estimates for Japanese growth had also been firmer than expected. A wide range of other economies in the region had also registered above-trend growth in the September quarter. These outcomes were partly a reflection of the significant easing in monetary and fiscal policies and the absence of significant impairment in the financial sectors of most of these economies. ", " Members noted that expansionary monetary conditions were leading to pressure on asset markets in the Asian region. Lending for housing was growing strongly in a number of the higher-income economies, and house prices were also growing strongly in some economies. Policy-makers in those economies were becoming concerned about these developments and a range of ‘macro-prudential’ measures had been implemented in some economies, such as reductions in the maximum loan-to-valuation ratios on certain types of housing loans. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The data on the domestic economy over the past month had mostly been positive. Although the September quarter national accounts were being published two weeks later than usual, many of the input series had been published, including data pointing to a positive contribution to growth from the inventory cycle. Overall, the data suggested a rise in GDP for the quarter. ", " Business surveys released over the past month had been strong, suggesting that business conditions were continuing to improve and that capacity utilisation had risen from the relatively low levels seen earlier in the year. Members observed that the direction of the movement in the surveys was consistent with other evidence, although the strength of the improvement had been surprising. While the surveys had been reasonably good indicators of the pace of activity in the past, it was possible that part of the improvement reflected relief that the earlier slowing in the economy had been much milder than feared. ", " Information on the labour market had also mostly been positive. Employment was estimated to have increased in October, and the unemployment rate had remained around 5¾ per cent for more than half a year. Surveys suggested that hiring intentions of businesses were gradually picking up. However, absent a further easing in the participation rate, there could still be some increase in the unemployment rate, given that, at this stage, trend growth in employment was still running below growth in the working-age population. ", " Members discussed trends in retail spending. Although data for the September quarter had shown a small fall in the volume of sales, and recent liaison suggested mixed trading conditions since then, this had followed very strong growth in the first half of the year, supported by the stimulus payments to households. Motor vehicle sales to households in October had been above the low levels seen earlier in the year, and liaison pointed to strong sales in November. Measures of consumer sentiment remained at very high levels. ", " Recent data on business investment pointed to a fall in spending in the September quarter, especially for non-residential building. However, investment had held up much better than expected earlier in the year. Engineering construction was at very high levels and likely to rise further as LNG projects picked up. The recent data also suggested strong growth in public-sector investment, with construction spending at high levels, including spending on both educational facilities and broader infrastructure. ", " Members discussed developments in the housing market. Estimates from private-sector data providers indicated that housing prices had continued to rise at a robust pace in October. Housing lending to owner-occupiers was growing at a solid rate, although growth in lending to investors was fairly subdued. Data for building approvals, including figures for October, which were released during the meeting, continued to show divergent trends: approvals for houses were now well above the lows seen in late 2008, but approvals for apartments remained around the lowest levels in more than a decade. The latter reflected both difficulties faced by developers in obtaining finance and the high cost of bringing new supply to market. Members also discussed the particular challenges posed by high levels of resources sector investment, including the supply problems and high housing prices that were already presenting challenges in some regions. ", " Business credit had again fallen in October, and was around 7 per cent lower than a year earlier. Members discussed the extent to which this reflected developments in the supply of and demand for credit and the substitution between different sources of finance, including from the capital markets. They noted that the fall in credit partly reflected a desire on the part of some businesses to pay down debt, using internally generated funds, issuance of equity and a drawdown in deposits, which had been at quite high levels as businesses had earlier sought to build their liquidity. While supply-side factors had contributed to the fall in credit in particular sectors, such as property development, members noted reports suggesting tentative signs of greater willingness on the part of financial institutions to lend to these sectors. ", " The wage price index showed continued moderation in private-sector wage growth in the September quarter, although public-sector wage growth had remained quite firm. Members noted that the slowdown in growth in private-sector wages provided some confidence that a further moderation in underlying inflation was in prospect, consistent with staff forecasts. "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board's discussion of financial markets commenced with a briefing on developments in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The debt standstill agreement sought by a subsidiary of Dubai World (a financing arm of the Dubai Government) had come at a time of thin trading conditions in the major financial markets, and had therefore resulted in sharp movements in some market prices. Members were informed that the Australian banks had minimal exposure to the UAE. Given the substantial asset holdings of Dubai World and the size of the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, most market participants did not regard the exposure of foreign banks to the UAE as being likely to lead to wider financial instability. ", " There had been no change in monetary policy settings in the major advanced economies over the past month, and the expected timing of the first steps to tighten policy by the major central banks had been pushed out to the third quarter of 2010 at the earliest. Monetary policy had been eased further in some emerging market economies. ", " In government bond markets, yields had been steady over most of the past month. However, in Europe, yield spreads to German government bonds had widened, most notably for Greek government bonds, following a ratings announcement, as well as concerns over Greek banks' reliance on funding from the European Central Bank. ", " Turning to government-guaranteed bond issuance by banks, members noted that one UK bank had accounted for about half of the issuance in the past month. In the United States, non-government bond issuance generally had been modest in the past few months, largely reflecting the negligible balance sheet growth of financials. ", " In Australia, there had been a significant amount of bond issuance by banks in recent months. The share of unguaranteed issuance, mainly offshore, had been around 75 per cent of the total, and some longer-term bonds had been issued. Spreads on bank debt had widened somewhat, with costs increasing slightly. ", " Members were briefed about movements in cross-currency basis swap spreads. These spreads had risen considerably in the past few months, partly reflecting global developments but also the increased demand from borrowers to bring offshore deals back onshore. On the other side of the market, Kangaroo bond issuance had increased as supranational entities had issued Australian dollar bonds – swapping the proceeds back into US dollars had allowed them to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs. ", " The Australian securitisation markets had continued to show signs of improvement. Two more issues had occurred without the support of the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) and a number of other deals were pending, while overall pricing was becoming more economic as spreads in the secondary market had declined in recent months. Issuers were looking to broaden the appeal of residential mortgage-backed securities; one recent issue featured the inclusion of a buy-back facility to reduce liquidity risk. This was designed to overcome a concern that had been cited by investors for not participating in this market. The Government had announced that the AOFM would be purchasing a further $8 billion of these securities. ", " In the domestic money market, the bank bill spread to the expected cash rate had tended to rise over the past month. Strong competition for deposits had kept deposit rates relatively high, particularly on ‘specials’. ", " Turning to share markets, global markets had rallied prior to the emergence of financial strains in Dubai. An exception to the broad trends had been the Japanese market, where the Nikkei had fallen since mid year as the yen had appreciated. The strongest performing share markets since the recent trough had been those in the emerging market economies, although these had fallen the most from the previous peak. The Australian market had broadly tracked global markets in the past few months, with gains mainly concentrated in the resources sector. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had continued to depreciate and was now only a little above its record low in early 2008. The Chinese renminbi had remained essentially fixed to the US dollar, which meant it had depreciated against many other currencies in the Asian region. This had prompted some of these countries to consider restrictions on capital flows, as well as the adoption of prudential measures to try to limit the effect of these inflows on asset prices. ", " The Australian dollar had been volatile during the month but reached its highest levels against the US dollar, and in trade-weighted terms, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 months earlier. The strong appreciation over the past year meant the Australian dollar was now only around 5 per cent below its post-float high against the US dollar. The exchange rate had again exhibited a high correlation with global equity markets over the past month. ", " Members noted that banks had fully passed through the rise in the cash rate at the previous meeting to variable housing rates, and that indicator rates on small business lending had also been increased by 25 basis points by all but one of the major banks. Increases in lending rates were generally matching increases in overall funding costs. Expectations for future monetary policy tightening had eased a little over the past month. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members considered the main issues for the decision were: ", " Members agreed that the level of the cash rate set when the outlook appeared to be much weaker would be too low for an economy that had resumed expanding, with a smaller amount of spare capacity than had earlier been expected. The Board had taken early action at the previous two meetings to adjust the cash rate to a less accommodative setting. Even after those changes, and taking into account the increase in the spread between the cash rate and borrowing rates over the past two years, most lending rates were still noticeably below normal. Members agreed that, if developments unfolded as currently expected, monetary policy would need to be adjusted further over time to lessen the degree of stimulus. That adjustment would not be intended to slow demand compared with the current forecast path, but aimed simply at keeping the stance of policy appropriate for improving economic conditions. ", " The question for members was whether it was more appropriate to take a further step at this meeting or to hold the cash rate steady pending a further evaluation of developments at the February meeting. Members canvassed the arguments for each course of action. They weighed the potential for adverse effects on confidence of a further adjustment at this time, the continuing uncertainty over the international outlook given conditions in the major economies, and the high level of the exchange rate. Members also considered the likely long-run pressures on the economy from the combined demand for housing and infrastructure and resources sector investment over the years ahead. They were mindful that the approach of lowering interest rates very quickly in response to the threat of serious economic weakness needed to be accompanied by a timely removal of at least some of that stimulus once the threat had passed, if interest rates were not to end up being too low for an extended period. ", " Members saw the arguments as finely balanced, but concluded that the stance of monetary policy would best reflect the circumstances facing the economy over the period ahead if there were an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points at this meeting. Members saw this adjustment, together with those in the preceding two meetings, as materially shifting the stance of policy to a less accommodative setting and, therefore, as increasing the flexibility available to the Board at future meetings. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to raise the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75 per cent, effective 2 December. "]}},
{"Date": ["Melbourne – 3 April 2012"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury), John Akehurst, Jillian Broadbent AO, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Heather Ridout, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the growth rate of the world economy was expected to be at a below-trend pace in 2012, with ongoing weakness in Europe and an easing in the pace of growth in China. However, growth in Australia's major trading partners, weighted by shares of merchandise exports from Australia, was expected to be around average in 2012. This would be underpinned by the continued economic recovery in the United States, the prospect of still-solid growth in China, and a recovery in activity in other parts of east Asia following temporary supply shocks. The financial problems in Europe continued to be a potential source of adverse shocks to the world economy, despite downside risks to near-term global growth having receded somewhat over the past month. ", " Growth in the Chinese economy had clearly slowed over the past six months in response to a policy-induced softening in domestic demand and weaker external demand. Export volumes had been broadly flat for much of the past year, and official efforts to cool housing demand had led to a gradual decline in turnover and dwelling prices in coastal cities. Recent indicators, however, suggested that growth in investment and retail sales had been steady for some time now, while growth in industrial production had stabilised at somewhat lower levels. Crude steel production had recovered from earlier falls and iron ore imports remained elevated. Inflation had eased in recent months to below the authorities' 4 per cent target, reflecting a decline in food prices as well as some easing in non-food inflation. ", " In east Asia, the pace of activity appeared to have picked up in early 2012, although the data remained difficult to interpret given the early timing of the Lunar New Year. In Japan, reconstruction spending in the regions affected by the natural disasters a year earlier had finally begun. After shutting down all but one of its nuclear power stations, Japan had switched to other energy sources, which had led to a sharp rise in LNG imports. ", " Members were briefed on the ongoing recovery in the United States. After solid growth in business investment through much of 2011, investment indicators had softened in early 2012. In contrast, consumption growth had picked up. Importantly, labour market indicators had continued to improve. Non-farm payrolls rose by an average of around 250,000 a month in January and February, but remained more than 5 million below the previous peak. The housing market continued to be very weak, though some indicators showed a slight pick-up in recent months. ", " Activity in the euro area remained weak and, in line with this, the unemployment rate in February had risen for the eighth consecutive month to be 10.8 per cent. Members noted that while there were some positive signs in the recent indicators, with exports from the euro area having increased and industrial production stabilising in January, the purchasing managers' indices for the manufacturing and services sectors declined in March. ", " After peaking in the September quarter, Australia's terms of trade fell by almost 5 per cent in the December quarter 2011, owing to declines in bulk commodity prices. Since the start of 2012, spot prices for coal had fallen by 6–7½ per cent, but iron ore prices had increased by around 10 per cent. Over the same period, Tapis crude oil prices had increased by 14 per cent, to US$134 per barrel, in part reflecting concerns about future supply from the Middle East. To the extent that higher oil prices reflected concerns about supply, they were adding to the downside risks to the global recovery and upside risks to headline inflation. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the national accounts for the December quarter had shown an increase in real GDP of 0.4 per cent in the quarter and 2.3 per cent over the year, which were both lower than expected. Private domestic demand had grown strongly over the year, led by growth in mining investment. However, growth in exports over 2011 had been weaker than expected, mainly because of lower coal exports, which, in turn, reflected a slower recovery from the floods in Queensland in early 2011, together with a slower take-up of new rail and port facilities in NSW and Queensland. Service exports had also been weak, reflecting a decline in the number of visas for foreign students as well as the effects of the higher exchange rate and lower external demand. ", " The national accounts showed that household consumption spending on both goods and services increased by around 3½ per cent over the year to December. This was a little higher than the rise in disposable income over the same period, and it was also stronger than suggested by other partial indicators, including the Bank's retail liaison. More recent indicators show that consumer sentiment fell in March to be a little below its average level, with household concerns regarding future unemployment at their highest level since mid 2009. ", " Members spent some time exploring reasons for the weakness in many of the indicators for housing turnover and building activity across Australia. They noted the apparent sensitivity of developers to the outlook for dwelling prices. New dwelling construction had fallen in the December quarter and there was little sign of a pick-up in building or loan approvals, though house prices had shown some signs of stabilising recently. While auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had picked up a bit of late, they remained below their average levels. ", " Indicators of business activity had been mixed. While business surveys suggested that overall conditions remained at average levels, there were significant differences across sectors and business confidence remained somewhat below average. Mining investment had increased by around 60 per cent over 2011 and, with a large number of projects already at a commitment stage, resource investment and export volumes appeared likely to increase further in coming years. In contrast, the level of non-mining investment had been flat over 2011, and recent surveys of business intentions suggested that non-mining investment was likely to remain sluggish for some time. Business credit growth had increased slightly over recent months, but remained low. ", " Exports had grown modestly in recent months, in part reflecting disruptions to the supply of bulk commodities. While preliminary data for February suggested that coal exports from Queensland had now returned to their pre-flood levels, production was still being affected by industrial action in Queensland and a shortage of explosives in NSW. In addition, export volumes of iron ore in the March quarter had been affected by cyclone activity, while service exports had been affected by the sharp fall in the number of international students in Australia over the past year or so, with no indications that this would be reversed in the near term. In contrast, the outlook for rural exports remained strong following a large winter crop and good rains across the eastern states. ", " Labour market conditions remained subdued, with employment falling by 15,000 in February and showing little change for much of the preceding year; increases in employment in mining, health and public administration had broadly offset declines in employment in manufacturing, retail trade and accommodation &amp; food services. Despite this, the unemployment rate had remained at around 5¼ per cent for more than six months. Members noted, however, that an easing in average hours worked and a decline in the participation rate were indicative of a softer labour market than that implied by the unemployment rate. ", " There had been little new information on wages and prices this month. Recent business surveys and liaison indicated that firms expected wages to continue to grow at around, or a little slower than, their recent pace. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial markets with developments in sovereign debt markets. They noted that the debt restructure in Greece went as well as could have been expected. With most private holders of Greek bonds agreeing to participate in the Greek debt restructure, the Greek Government was able to trigger collective action clauses to force the remainder to participate. As a consequence, three-quarters of Greek debt was now held by official entities. The debt restructuring in Greece was deemed a ‘credit event’, triggering credit default swaps. Despite earlier fears, members noted that this process appeared to have occurred smoothly. Among the other peripheral European countries, Spain's sovereign debt had come into sharper focus over the past month, reflecting a deterioration in the Spanish fiscal position as economic activity there declined. ", " Conditions in private-sector credit markets had continued to improve, bolstered by the European Central Bank's second three-year liquidity operation. Corporate bond spreads had narrowed further and were now significantly lower than at the beginning of the year, though still higher than in the middle of 2011, particularly for banks. The improved conditions in markets over the past month had led to a high volume of bond issuance. The Australian banks had taken advantage of the improvement in funding conditions to issue a large volume of secured and unsecured debt. Members were briefed on the significant fall in the relative cost of that issuance since the start of the year – around 50 basis points for a five‑year issue – which would help to alleviate the pressure of higher funding costs in coming months. ", " Members noted that a major near-term determinant of funding cost pressures for Australian banks would be the pricing of term deposits. Bank deposits now accounted for more than half of banks' overall funding, with the share having increased from 40 per cent in 2007; within that, term deposits had risen from 30 to 45 per cent of the total. As a consequence of banks competing aggressively for term deposits, their cost had risen materially relative to the cash rate. The relatively short average maturity of term deposits meant that any changes in deposit pricing would flow through relatively quickly to the whole of the banks' deposit books. ", " Equity prices in the United States rose by a further 3 per cent over the month, with the S&amp;P 500 recording one of its strongest quarterly rises, but the Australian equity market had not experienced similar increases in recent times. In part, this reflected concerns about a slowdown in China (with Chinese equity prices falling by 6 per cent over the month), but it also reflected the composition of the local market, with the (recently underperforming) mining and financial sectors having a significantly greater weight in the local index, and technology stocks a much smaller weight, than in the S&amp;P 500. ", " The Australian dollar had depreciated over the past month, but still remained at a high level. The recent depreciation, in part, reflected increased concerns among market participants about the effects of the moderation in Chinese growth on the Australian economy. Data released during the month confirmed that offshore purchases of Australian government debt were sizeable in the December quarter. Foreign holdings currently accounted for three-quarters of Commonwealth Government securities on issue and about one-third of state government debt. ", " Members noted that market pricing currently suggested just under an even chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the current meeting, with at least two reductions expected over the remainder of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that recent information on the world economy was consistent with growth at a below-trend pace in 2012 and slower than in 2011. However, most forecasters did not expect a deep downturn, as had been feared towards the end of 2011. Growth in China had slowed to a more sustainable pace, as the authorities there had intended. Although conditions in other parts of Asia had softened in 2011, partly in the wake of natural disasters, the pace of activity appeared to have picked up in early 2012. A fall in inflation in the region provided scope for an easing of financial conditions if needed. The moderate expansion of the US economy was continuing but economic conditions in several European countries remained very weak. Commodity prices had declined for a few months in late 2011 and were noticeably below their peaks, but generally had been relatively stable at quite high levels for the past few months. Although Australia's terms of trade therefore appeared to have peaked, the level remained high. ", " Financial market sentiment had improved further in recent weeks, following the progress that had been made in addressing the sustainability of the fiscal and debt positions in several European countries. Members noted, however, that these issues were far from resolved, and that Europe remained a potential source of adverse shocks in the future. Wholesale funding costs were tending to decline, though they remained higher relative to benchmark rates than in mid 2011, and corporations and well-rated banks were able to tap capital markets for funding. ", " For the domestic economy, members observed that the balance of recent data suggested that output growth was somewhat below trend over 2011, despite private investment spending underpinning the fastest growth in domestic demand for four years. They noted the sharp differences in performance between sectors and regions of the economy, and the considerable structural change that was occurring, as well as the soft overall conditions in the housing sector and the likelihood of significant fiscal tightening in the next few years. Despite the rate of unemployment showing little change for some time, it was apparent that labour market conditions had softened over the course of 2011. ", " Over the past month, domestic financial conditions had been mostly unchanged, with interest rates for borrowers remaining close to their medium-term averages, credit growth modest and the exchange rate remaining high in the context of an easing in the terms of trade. ", " There had been no significant data on inflation over the past month. In underlying terms, inflation was expected to remain within the target over the year ahead. Members again noted that some improvement in productivity growth would be needed to achieve this forecast. ", " The Board had eased monetary policy late in 2011. Since then members had lowered their assessment of the pace of growth somewhat. If slower growth in demand could be expected to result in a more moderate inflation outcome, then a case could be made for a further easing of monetary policy. The Board would have the opportunity at its next meeting to review the inflation outlook based on comprehensive new data on prices, as well as information on demand and output. Members judged it prudent to evaluate those data before considering a further policy adjustment. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.25 per cent. "]}},

The US economy had continued to expand at a moderate pace. Indications were that growth had slowed to a more sustainable pace in China, and activity had generally picked up elsewhere in east Asia. Even so, activity in the euro area was still contracting. Global inflation pressures remained subdued, despite some boost to headline measures from elevated oil prices. With financial markets remaining unsettled, the risks emanating from Europe continued to cloud the global outlook. ", " In April, the IMF lifted its forecasts for global growth to 3.5 per cent in 2012 and 4.1 per cent in 2013, with small upward revisions for both years since its January forecasts. As had been the case in recent years, emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, were expected to be the main driver of global growth. The IMF continued to see the balance of risks to the global economy weighted to the downside. ", " In Europe, aggregate measures of consumer confidence had improved and exports had picked up. Retail sales and investment indicators had steadied at lower levels. The combination of this and the deterioration in business conditions was indicative of ongoing contraction in output of the region as a whole. Members noted that while European leaders had made some progress in addressing fiscal imbalances and implementing structural reforms, much work still needed to be done. Further, the task continued to be complicated by the negative feedback loop between fiscal consolidation, private-sector deleveraging and weak growth. ", " For the US economy, members noted that GDP growth had slowed slightly in the March quarter, which, along with other data, confirmed that growth had been a little below trend. Labour market conditions remained positive, which had been supporting consumption, although indicators of business investment and flat industrial production suggested that growth had slowed in recent months. Members observed that the housing market would probably continue to weigh on economic activity for some time, with a large number of mortgages still in foreclosure. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding the legislated fiscal consolidation in 2013 was another factor likely to weigh on household and business confidence during the period ahead. ", " Growth in China had moderated to a more sustainable pace, with GDP growing by 1.8 per cent in the March quarter, to be 8.1 per cent higher over the year. The slowdown was largely attributed to slower growth in domestic demand, as had been intended by the Chinese authorities through tighter domestic policies. Nevertheless, the residential property market remained weak, with property prices continuing to fall. Activity in the rest of east Asia continued to recover from the natural disasters in 2011, which had disrupted supply chains throughout the region. Business and consumer confidence had generally improved, while exports had been supported by a pick-up in demand from the United States. Inflation pressures across the region had continued to moderate. ", " Commodity prices overall had been relatively stable recently, and had increased only slightly over the year to date. The spot price for iron ore had continued to drift higher since the start of the year, consistent with signs of a recovery in Chinese steel production as well as some supply disruptions in Australia and Brazil. In contrast, coking coal prices had softened as supply from Queensland had returned to its level prior to the flooding in early 2011, and base metals prices had trended lower in recent months. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the available indicators suggested that the domestic economy had been growing modestly in early 2012, although the pace of activity had continued to vary significantly across industries. The mining sector remained exceptionally strong, with work progressing on the very large pipeline of committed projects and capital imports rising strongly. Mining production had, nevertheless, been disrupted by adverse weather, industrial action and a shortage of explosives. ", " Conditions faced by many firms not exposed to the mining sector remained weak, with the high level of the exchange rate continuing to weigh on import-competing and exporting firms. Conditions remained particularly difficult in parts of the building, construction and manufacturing industries, as well as for many retailers. Survey measures also pointed to a softening in conditions in the business services sector, consistent with weakness in property markets and the non-mining sectors more generally. ", " Growth in consumer spending had eased in the December quarter and recent indicators suggested that consumption growth was a little below trend in early 2012, with consumers evidently concerned about their personal finances and job security. Consistent with this, the value of retail sales, which had been one of the weakest components of consumption over the past year, was soft in January and February. ", " Members were briefed on the continued weakness in the housing market generally and residential building activity in particular. Demand for housing finance had eased in the past few months and recent data suggested that dwelling prices had continued to decline, although there were tentative signs that the pace of decline had been more gradual overall in recent months. Despite dwelling prices declining relative to incomes and rises in rental yields, forward-looking indicators implied little prospect of an imminent recovery in housing construction. Information from liaison suggested that households were unwilling to commit to contracts for new dwellings because of concerns about job security and declining dwelling prices. ", " Employment growth had picked up a little in the March quarter. Together with a small fall in the participation rate, this had left the unemployment rate at around 5¼ per cent. The decline in participation along with weakness in trend hours worked were indicators of some increase in spare capacity in the labour market in recent months. Members noted that the data showed evidence of structural change, as employment in the mining sector had expanded rapidly while firms in a number of other sectors were responding to heightened competitive pressures by reducing employment in an effort to contain costs and improve productivity. Leading indicators, such as surveys and job vacancies, painted a mixed picture, but generally suggested modest employment growth in the period ahead. ", " Inflation in the March quarter was lower than expected, with various measures showing underlying inflation of around ¼ per cent in the quarter and 2–2¼ per cent on a year-ended basis. The headline CPI fell by 0.2 per cent in the quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, to be 1.6 per cent higher over the year. A large fall in fruit prices, in particular banana prices, had subtracted 0.3 percentage points from quarterly inflation. More generally, tradables prices declined, reflecting both the softness in consumer demand and further pass-through of the earlier exchange rate appreciation, with the prices of some household goods, clothing and overseas holidays all falling in the quarter. Non-tradables prices, in contrast, increased by 0.7 per cent in the quarter and by 3.5 per cent over the year, underpinned by relatively large increases in a range of services prices but with falls in the prices of domestic travel &amp; accommodation and new dwellings. The slowing in non-tradables inflation, and some of the decline in tradables prices, appeared to indicate that there had been pressure on margins owing to the relative softness in demand in the non-mining sector. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. The central estimate was for GDP to grow by around 3 per cent over 2012 and 2013, although employment growth was expected to remain subdued in the near term. Forecasts of mining investment had been revised higher, with information from liaison and ABS data indicating more work in the pipeline than had previously been expected. This investment was anticipated to provide stimulus to a number of other sectors, but growth outside of the mining sector was expected to be below trend in the near term, affected by the high exchange rate, softer government spending and subdued conditions in the housing market and building industry more generally. The forecast for export growth had been revised lower, largely reflecting a reassessment of the ability of mining companies to utilise new port and transport capacity fully in the near term, along with weaker manufacturing exports. ", " Members observed that the expected outlook for inflation was somewhat lower than the previous forecast made in February. Underlying inflation (excluding the effect of the carbon price) was forecast to remain within the lower half of the target range over the next few years, staying close to the recent rate of inflation over the next year before picking up a little later in the forecast period. Headline inflation would be affected by a number of one-off factors in the near term. The unwinding of the earlier spike in fruit prices would hold down year-ended inflation in the first half of 2012, followed by the introduction of the carbon price from the September quarter, which was expected to boost headline inflation by around 0.7 percentage points and underlying inflation by around ¼ percentage point over the year to June 2013. "], "Financial Markets": [" Sentiment in global financial markets deteriorated in April, following several months of improvement. Members noted that the deterioration had not been triggered by any particular event but, rather, it reflected renewed concerns about the inter-related state of public finances and weakness of economic activity in the euro area. This had been most evident for Spain and Italy, where yields on government bonds had risen significantly as foreign investors reduced their exposures by not rolling over maturing debt and selling debt in the secondary market. ", " Imminent elections in France and Greece had spurred further concern on the part of investors, with a risk that parties supportive of the Greek assistance package would not be able to form a new government. Investors had also focused on the Netherlands following the resignation of the Dutch Prime Minister and cabinet because of an inability to agree on fiscal austerity measures. ", " Reflecting the concerns about the euro area, as well as some weaker-than-expected data in the United States and China, government bond yields for the major advanced economies had declined. Yields on US 10-year bonds had fallen below 2 per cent again, while yields on 10‑year bonds in Germany fell to historic lows. In Australia, the expectation of a reduction in the policy rate had resulted in government bond yields declining by more than those in overseas markets, with the yield on 10-year Australian government debt falling to a 60-year low of 3.64 per cent. Yields on Australian state debt also fell to multi-decade lows, even though spreads to Australian government debt had widened a little over the month. ", " Members noted that bond issuance by Australian banks had been lower in April, although this followed particularly strong issuance in recent months and in part reflected an issuance blackout ahead of three of the major banks announcing their profit results. Deposit rates at Australian banks remained relatively high, with no sign of competitive pressures easing. Reflecting this, banks' margins were estimated to be somewhat narrower than in the middle of 2011, notwithstanding recent increases in some lending rates. ", " Global equity markets declined in April, reflecting some large falls in Europe and Japan. Australian equities had outperformed global markets over this period, mainly because Australian bank share prices had risen compared with large falls globally for banks, particularly in Europe. ", " Currency markets generally had been less affected by the deterioration in global sentiment, although the yen was again appreciating, reversing some of its depreciation earlier in the year. Members observed that the Chinese renminbi had been broadly unchanged over April and that the authorities had announced a wider trading band for the currency. The Australian dollar had also been relatively steady, remaining at a high level both against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis, despite the lower-than-expected inflation data. ", " On domestic monetary policy, members noted that the market was more than fully pricing in a 25 basis point reduction in the cash rate in May, with a 40 per cent chance of a 50 basis point reduction. Market pricing embodied an expectation that the cash rate would decline to 3¼ per cent by the end of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Although the latest forecasts for global growth had been revised up slightly – with growth rising to around trend in 2013 – members noted that the international economic and financial environment remained quite uncertain. Conditions were weak in the euro area, and the risk of an escalation of sovereign debt problems remained. Prospects were for the US economy to continue its gradual recovery, while growth in China was likely to be slower than in recent years but on a more sustainable footing. Growth in the rest of Asia was expected to increase, despite continuing to be restrained somewhat by the trade and financial linkages with the advanced economies. ", " Recent evidence suggested that the Australian economy was growing somewhat below trend. While the mining boom continued to gain momentum, overall growth was being weighed down by weakness in other sectors of the economy. ", " At the same time, credit growth for households had been marginally lower over the past year than over the previous year, and business credit was rising at only a very modest rate. Elevated competitive pressures had kept deposit rates in Australia high relative to the cash rate. At the margin, wholesale funding costs had declined over recent months, though they remained higher, relative to benchmark rates, than in mid 2011, and the lagged effects of this were still working their way through the funding structure. The rise in funding costs had led banks to increase their lending rates over recent months by around 10–12 basis points. ", " The March quarter CPI had confirmed that, in underlying terms, inflation had slowed over recent quarters after a rise during the early part of 2011. The staff assessment was that inflation was likely to remain in the lower half of the target range over the foreseeable future, with cost pressures expected to be contained given the forecast for moderate growth in the economy. This forecast assumed that the soft conditions currently being experienced would lead to lower growth in unit costs. ", " Since the Board eased monetary policy late in 2011, new information had led the Bank to lower somewhat its assessment of the pace of growth of the economy. At previous meetings, members had agreed that if slower growth in demand resulted in more moderate inflation, it would strengthen the case for a further easing in monetary policy. Given recently accumulated information on demand and the rate of inflation, together with the revised forecasts that had been presented, members considered it appropriate for monetary policy to be eased. Members noted that interest rates faced by the general community had tended to increase a little since the Board's previous change to the cash rate in December. They judged it to be desirable that interest rates move below those that had prevailed in December. Accordingly, the Board decided that a reduction of 50 basis points in the cash rate was, in this instance, necessary in order to deliver the appropriate level of borrowing rates.

Whereas the situation had been looking quite negative in early December, recent actions by the European Central Bank and euro-area governments had boosted confidence, although further measures would be required to bring about a comprehensive solution to place government finances on a sustainable footing. There had also been an encouraging pick-up in business surveys of the manufacturing and services sectors in most countries – including in Europe – over the past couple of months. ", " In January, the IMF had lowered its forecast for global growth in 2012 to 3.3 per cent – a downward revision of nearly ¾ percentage point since September 2011 – and in its accompanying commentary had focused on the elevated downside risks to the global economy. If realised, this revised central forecast would represent below-trend growth in the global economy, but would be within the normal range of outcomes and nothing like the extreme weakness seen in 2009. Growth in the emerging market economies, particularly those in Asia, was expected to be much stronger than in the advanced economies. As a result, average growth in Australia's main trading partners was expected to be around 1 percentage point higher than that for the world as a whole. ", " The European data for late 2011 suggested that the euro-area economy was in recession, with businesses and households curtailing their spending in response to the increased uncertainty. Business credit in Europe had fallen in December by an unexpectedly large amount, which was consistent with a reduced desire by banks to lend. The region was also experiencing a large fiscal contraction. Members observed that, in some countries, there appeared to be an adverse cycle whereby fiscal consolidation was weakening growth, which was leading to yet further fiscal tightening in an attempt to meet previously announced deficit targets. ", " In contrast, activity in the United States had been strengthening over recent months, with GDP growth picking up in the December quarter after a soft patch earlier in 2011. Employment growth had strengthened and the unemployment rate had fallen noticeably, though members noted that labour force participation was at its lowest rate in several decades. ", " There had also been tentative signs of improvement in housing activity, albeit from a low level. As in Europe, fiscal challenges would also influence the medium-term outlook, with a substantial fiscal contraction scheduled to occur in 2013. ", " In east Asia, growth had slowed in late 2011, reflecting weaker export demand from the North Atlantic economies and the earlier policy tightening, as well as some temporary supply factors, including the flooding in Thailand. Industrial production and exports contracted in the December quarter in most economies in the region, and growth in domestic demand had also softened. Importantly, though, the Chinese economy continued to expand strongly, albeit below the pace of the past couple of years, and inflation there had moderated. Prices and turnover in the Chinese residential property market had fallen, especially in the coastal provinces, where measures by the authorities to cool the market had been most aggressive; the slowing in the inland provinces had been less pronounced. A key ongoing uncertainty was the possibility that the slowing in the Chinese property market would have larger-than-expected ripple effects throughout the broader economy. ", " Consistent with the more positive tone in financial markets, most commodity prices had risen over the past two months, although they were still below their highs seen during 2011. Australia's terms of trade reached a record high in the September quarter, and were estimated to have declined by 7 per cent in the December quarter. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The Australian economy was estimated to have grown by around 2¾ per cent over 2011, which was a little below average, partly reflecting the extreme weather events early in the year. Conditions continued to vary significantly across industries as the economy adjusted to the very high terms of trade and the accompanying high exchange rate. Investment in the resources sector was expanding at a rapid pace, and over the next year the investment-to-GDP ratio was likely to reach its highest level in at least half a century. Another large LNG project had recently received final investment approval, bringing the total value of LNG projects approved or under construction to around $180 billion. ", " Members noted that conditions in a number of other sectors remained subdued, with the high exchange rate, soft consumer demand for goods, the scaling back of public investment and weak building construction all weighing on activity. Exports of services, particularly education, had been falling for several years, and manufacturing exports remained below the levels seen prior to the global financial crisis. The recovery in coal production had also taken longer than initially expected, with Queensland coal exports yet to recover fully to pre-flood levels. ", " Overall, measures of business conditions at the start of 2012 were around average, while measures of confidence were a little below average levels, after recovering from relatively low levels around August. Although the data were dated, non-mining profits had grown strongly over the year to the September quarter, contributing to internal funding. Business credit had also picked up, growing over the second half of 2011 after falling over the previous year. ", " In the labour market, the unemployment rate had remained steady at 5¼ per cent since August, after increasing in the preceding few months. Employment growth had, however, slowed noticeably, following the strong growth in 2010, with employment declining in a number of industries, including manufacturing, retail and real estate. Job vacancies remained at a high level and there had been a pick-up in job advertisements in January. Members observed that it appeared that additional demand for labour had been met largely through existing employees working longer hours over the past year, rather than through an increase in hiring. This was consistent with liaison, which suggested that the current economic uncertainties had made firms reluctant to hire additional workers without evidence of strong growth in demand. ", " Retail spending had been flat in nominal terms over the final months of 2011, although there had been moderate growth in sales volumes in the December quarter. Liaison with retailers suggested there had been a subdued start to December, then a strengthening in spending in the week or two prior to Christmas and over the post-Christmas sales period, followed by slower growth in January. Members noted that spending at department stores and clothing and footwear stores had fallen over 2011, while there had been solid growth in spending at some other types of stores. Spending was growing much faster in Western Australia than in other states. Consumer sentiment had picked up over recent months after its sharp decline in mid 2011, but remained slightly below its long-run average. ", " While housing prices had declined over 2011, there were signs of stabilisation in some major cities around the end of the year. Building construction activity remained subdued, reflecting the pull-forward from the earlier boost to grants to first home buyers, slower population growth, tight access to credit for developers and lowered expectations of capital gains. Housing credit continued to grow a little more slowly than household incomes. ", " Inflation in the December quarter had been broadly in line with expectations, with the various measures showing underlying inflation of around ½ per cent in the quarter. On a year-ended basis, underlying inflation was running at around 2½ per cent, the midpoint of the medium-term target range. Although the seasonally adjusted inflation data for the September quarter had been revised up a little, the latest data indicated that the pace of underlying inflation had moderated in the second half of 2011 compared with the above-average outcomes in the first half of the year. ", " The headline CPI had risen by 0.2 per cent (seasonally adjusted) in the December quarter, to be 3.1 per cent higher over 2011. Food price inflation generally remained subdued, and there was a large fall in the price of bananas, which subtracted around 0.3 percentage point from inflation in the quarter. Tradables prices (excluding food, fuel and tobacco) fell by around ½ per cent in the quarter and by 1 per cent over the year. Non-tradables prices increased by 0.9 per cent in the quarter and by 3.7 per cent over the year. While non-tradables inflation had slowed significantly since 2008, members noted that some further moderation was likely to be required for overall inflation to be consistent with the midpoint of the target range once the benefit from lower tradable prices faded. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. GDP was expected to grow at an around-trend pace over 2012 and 2013. The very strong growth in investment in the resources sector remained a key element in the forecasts. This investment was expected to have some positive spinoffs for a number of other sectors, although the high exchange rate, fiscal consolidation and changing consumption patterns meant that overall growth outside the resources sector was expected to remain below trend. Aggregate demand was expected to <br> continue to grow more quickly than output, with a higher share of demand being met through imports. The potential for a disorderly resolution of the sovereign debt problems in Europe remained the major downside risk for the global and domestic economies. ", " Members noted that the outlook for inflation was little changed from the previous forecast made in November. Underlying inflation was forecast to remain within the target range over the next few years, albeit in the upper half of the target range by 2014, as the disinflationary impetus from the exchange rate appreciation diminished. Headline inflation was expected to fall below underlying inflation in the near term as the earlier spike in fruit prices continued to unwind. Then, from the September quarter 2012, inflation would be boosted by the introduction of a price on carbon, which was expected to add 0.7 percentage point to headline inflation and around ¼ percentage point to underlying inflation over the following year. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion by noting the improved mood in global financial markets over December and January. The improvement was attributed to a number of factors, particularly the three-year liquidity operation by the European Central Bank (ECB), as well as better-than-expected data on economic conditions in the United States and the start of the new year itself, with investors more willing to take risk after having opted to conserve their positions into year end. ", " In late December, the ECB provided about €490 billion of three-year funding to banks (against acceptable collateral) and thereby significantly reduced the funding risk for the European banking system over the period ahead. Banks that had been unable to obtain funding in the market – several of which faced sizeable maturities in the short term – were able to fund themselves through the ECB at low cost. While this move largely dealt with the funding challenge for European banks, a number of banks still had not addressed their shortage of capital and had responded by continuing to shrink their balance sheets. ", " Members noted that the sovereign debt problems in Europe persisted, although sovereign debt yields had declined from their recent peaks, in line with the general improvement in market sentiment. Negotiations around the ‘haircuts’ on the private sector's holdings of Greek debt were reportedly nearing conclusion, with an effective haircut of around 70 per cent in prospect. However, Greece's adherence to the conditions of its rescue package continued to slip. The downgrade of France's sovereign credit rating from AAA by one rating agency had little effect on yields. ", " Government bond yields in the major advanced economies remained near their historic lows, owing to the strong demand for highly rated government debt. This strong demand had also resulted in sizeable purchases of Australian government debt by foreign sovereign asset managers in recent months. Australian 10-year yields had consequently fallen to a 50-year low, although the market for state government bonds (semis) had not benefited from these flows, as these sovereign asset managers often only purchased sovereign debt. While spreads between semis and Commonwealth Government securities (CGS) had consequently widened, the level of yields on semis remained low, given the low CGS yields. ", " Members noted that a number of central banks had lowered their policy rate in recent months, including the ECB, where its policy rate fell to 1 per cent. The People's Bank of China and the Reserve Bank of India lowered reserve requirements for banks, signalling a reversal in the direction of monetary policy in both countries. In Australia, the market had priced in a high probability of a reduction in the cash rate at this meeting, with further reductions expected later in the year. ", " The recent improvement in sentiment had seen global equity markets rise by around 7 per cent since the start of the year, after recording sizeable losses over the course of 2011 (with the notable exception of the US market, which had been little changed over 2011). ", " In foreign exchange markets, the euro had depreciated against most currencies and declined to multi-year lows against a number of currencies, including the yen and the Australian dollar. Members noted that, in Australia's case, the currency had reached its highest level in more than 20 years against both the euro and the pound. More generally, the Australian dollar had appreciated against most other currencies in recent weeks and approached the multi-year peaks reached in 2011. This occurred notwithstanding the fact that commodity prices and the terms of trade were off their highs, with purchases of Australian sovereign debt by overseas buyers an important influence on the exchange rate. ", " Members were informed that, while sentiment had generally improved, there had been a marked repricing of bank debt globally. Following the dislocation of bank debt markets globally in the latter part of 2011, issuance had picked up significantly in January, but the spreads at which bank debt was issued were significantly higher than in the middle of 2011. The Australian banks had issued sizeable amounts of covered bonds in a number of offshore markets in recent weeks at these higher spreads. Furthermore, the cost of swapping funds raised in offshore markets into Australian dollars had increased in recent months. There had also been two large issues of covered bonds in the Australian market, which had repriced the local bank debt curve significantly higher. Over the same period, Australian banks continued to compete actively for deposits, which resulted in the reductions in most deposit rates not fully matching the recent reductions in the cash rate. Collectively, these developments had increased banks' overall cost of funding relative to the cash rate and had narrowed the difference between banks' lending rates and funding costs. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" While the financial situation in Europe remained fragile, the likelihood of an extremely bad outcome seemed to have diminished somewhat over the previous couple of months, partly reflecting actions by the European policymakers. This, together with stronger economic data from the United States, had provided a mild boost to confidence in financial markets. Growth in China had moderated as intended, but on most indicators had remained quite robust through the second half of 2011. While there were still many uncertainties, the central forecast was for growth in the global economy in 2012 to be about ½ percentage point below trend. Australia's major trading partners were expected to continue to grow more quickly than the world as a whole. ", " Domestically, there were significant differences in conditions across sectors, with a considerable degree of structural adjustment occurring in the economy. Labour market conditions had softened during 2011 and the unemployment rate had increased slightly around mid year, though it had been steady over recent months. Overall demand growth remained firm and the outlook was for GDP growth to be close to trend over the next couple of years. The recent inflation data had confirmed that, in underlying terms, inflation was now at the midpoint of the target range. Inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the forecast period. Credit growth remained modest, though there had been a slight increase in demand for credit by businesses, and housing prices had showed some stabilisation around the end of 2011, after having declined for most of the year. The exchange rate had risen since early December. ", " Members noted that the Board's decisions in November and December 2011 to lower the cash rate by a cumulative 50 basis points in response to the improved inflation outlook and deterioration in the global economy had been passed through to most lending rates in the economy, which were now around average levels. With growth expected to be close to trend and inflation consistent with the target, the Board considered that this setting was appropriate for the overall macroeconomic outlook. They judged that if demand conditions were to weaken materially, the inflation outlook would provide scope for a further easing in monetary policy. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.25 per cent. "]}},

Fiscal and monetary policy settings remained highlyexpansionary and in some economies additional fiscal stimulus was in prospect. Growth forecasts for theglobal economy and Australia's major trading partners had been revised a little higher as aresult. However, the brighter outlook did not change members' assessment that the global recoverywas still likely to be bumpy and uneven, with most economies expected to be well short of theirpre-pandemic trajectories at the end of the forecast period. Labour markets were therefore likely tohave considerable spare capacity for some time, resulting in subdued inflationary pressures. The spreadof the virus and the speed of vaccine distribution remained key determinants of the outlook.", "Members noted that the global recovery had lost some momentum around the turn of the year asrestrictions on mobility in some economies were tightened following a resurgence of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> infections. This continued a pattern observed in the preceding year ofhighly variable growth outcomes across economies. China and some other economies in east Asia hadexperienced relatively strong recoveries, with GDP in the current year likely to be tracking at levelsexpected before the pandemic. Favourable health outcomes and a surge in manufactured goods exports hadcontributed to this. Many economies were expected to have recovered their pre-pandemic levels of GDP bythe end of the year, but still be short of levels expected prior to the onset of the pandemic. In asmaller number of economies, including some in Europe that had experienced severe health outcomes, GDPwas expected to still be below pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2021.", "Members noted that the strength of the global demand for goods, the faster-than-expected recovery inglobal economic activity and the improved outlook had contributed to a strong rebound in commodity andother key input prices. Oil prices had recovered much of their decline early in the pandemic, whilebase metals prices were above pre-pandemic levels. Iron ore prices had also risen further in recentmonths, to trade at their highest levels in many years. High iron ore prices had been supported byongoing supply disruptions in Brazil and strong demand from Chinese steel producers. The highercommodity prices had supported a marked rise in Australia's terms of trade, which was expected toreach its highest level in nearly a decade in the March quarter. Members also noted that otherimportant global input prices, such as those for semiconductors, had risen above levels prevailingbefore the pandemic, reflecting strong global demand for electronics and other goods that usesemiconductors as inputs.", "Members noted that several vaccines had already been approved for use internationally, and that morewere likely to be available in the near future. Some countries, including those with well-functioningpublic health systems and ample initial vaccine supplies, had been able to meet or exceed their earlytargets for the rollout of their vaccine programs, while other countries had fallen short of theirtargets. Distributing and administering vaccines on such a large scale and under intense time pressurewas presenting significant logistical and administrative challenges for many countries.", "In concluding their discussion of the international economy, members discussed the significant fiscalresponses to the pandemic. Additional fiscal support had been announced in a number of economies thatwere affected by second or third waves of infections. The wide variation in public debt levels prior tothe pandemic, and in health outcomes over the preceding year, helped to explain some of thecross-country differences in fiscal responses."], "Domestic economic developments": ["Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that the recovery in the second half of 2020 had beenfaster than initially expected, in line with the pattern observed internationally. Favourable healthoutcomes in Australia had enabled the lifting of restrictions and boosted activity. Consumption hadrebounded quickly as health-related restrictions on activity had been eased, suggesting thatsupply-side constraints were key to driving the spending patterns observed during the pandemic;households had also adapted their consumption habits. Business investment had fallen, but by less thanexpected. More broadly, the rapid bounce-back in domestic activity had also been supported byadditional fiscal measures announced by the Australian and state governments in the latter part of2020. This had enabled a faster recovery in labour market conditions than expected a few monthsearlier, with the unemployment rate in the December quarter declining more quickly than even the upsidescenario presented in the November 2020 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.", "In discussing the outlook for activity and the labour market, members noted that the forecasts underthe baseline scenario had been upgraded relative to 3 months earlier. This upward revisionincorporated the stronger starting point for the forecasts and improved outlook. GDP and employment werenow expected to reach their pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2021, around 6–12 monthsearlier than previously expected.", "Members noted that the lowest rate of population growth since the First World War would continue tohave a significant bearing on the outlook. The level of GDP was not expected to return to its previoustrajectory over the forecast period, largely because population growth would be so much lower thanassumed prior to the pandemic. Lower population growth would continue to weigh on both aggregate demandand labour supply in the period ahead, although the effects on labour supply and wages would be partlylimited by foreign students tending to have a lower participation rate than the domestic working-agepopulation. Low population growth, reflecting reduced net overseas migration in particular, was alsoexpected to affect high-density residential investment for some time to come. Members noted that overalldwelling investment would have been lower had the HomeBuilder program and other state governmentincentives been less effective in stimulating activity in the detached housing sector.", "In their discussion of the labour market, members observed that, in contrast to expectations3 months earlier, the peak in the unemployment rate had probably already occurred. Notwithstandinga swift rebound in the participation rate, the firmer outlook for employment had resulted in a lowerexpected unemployment rate profile across the forecast period. Despite the end of the JobKeeper programin March creating some uncertainty for near-term labour market outcomes, the unemployment rate wasexpected to resume trending lower in the second half of the year. In the baseline scenario, theunemployment rate was expected to decline to around 6 per cent by the end of 2021, beforereaching around 5¼ per cent by mid 2023. While the strong recovery and improvedoutlook for employment had reduced the prospects for substantial scarring effects in the labour market,the forecasts implied that there would still be spare capacity in the labour market at the end of theforecast period.", "Members commenced their discussion of the household sector by noting that the rebound in consumption inthe second half of 2020 had been supported by very strong growth in disposable income over the year. Astemporary income support measures tapered or ceased, household income was expected to decline through tothe middle of 2021, before resuming steady growth in line with recovery in the labour market. In thebaseline scenario, consumption growth was expected to remain positive but moderate in the period ahead;in per capita terms, the level of consumption had rebounded strongly and, by 2022, was forecast to havereturned to levels expected prior to the pandemic. The outlook for consumption was supported by manyhouseholds strengthening their balance sheet and liquidity positions during the pandemic. Restrictionson consumption, precautionary behaviour and strong growth in incomes had contributed to householdsadding considerably to savings during the June and September quarters of 2020. Members noted thesignificant uncertainty around whether and how quickly the savings ratio would return to more typicallevels, and how households would use the additional savings accumulated during 2020.", "Members observed that conditions in the housing market had been more resilient than expected, which hadassisted the economic recovery. Housing prices had recently been rising across most of Australiafollowing an earlier period where conditions had been quite variable. This had returned the nationalhousing price index to levels reached around 4 years earlier. Housing price increases had beenlarger in regional Australia than in the capital cities; price levels in some smaller capital cities hadincreased to new highs. Members noted that there were few signs of a deterioration in lending standards;however, lending standards would be monitored closely in the period ahead.", "In their discussion of the outlook for wages growth and inflation, members noted that the forecastsunder the baseline scenario had increased a little relative to 3 months earlier, in line with thelower expected unemployment rate. However, both wages growth and underlying inflation were expected toremain below 2 per cent over the forecast period, reflecting ongoing spare capacity in theeconomy.", "Members observed that wages growth had been subdued for a number of years and had recently declinedfurther, to the lowest levels in at least 2 decades. Firms had responded quickly in the earlystages of the pandemic by delaying wage increases, imposing wage freezes and, in some cases, applyingtemporary wage cuts. Liaison contacts had suggested it could be some time before wage freezes werelifted. The improved outlook for activity and employment was expected to lift private sector wagesgrowth a little over the forecast period. However, this was partly offset by the downward revision tothe outlook for public sector wages growth, as some state governments had announced measures to capwages growth at rates below those seen in recent years.", "Turning to the outlook for inflation, members noted that underlying inflation pressures were subduedand expected to remain so in the period ahead. Although the outlook for underlying inflation had beenrevised up a little relative to 3 months earlier, ongoing spare capacity and low wages growth wereexpected to keep underlying inflation below 2 per cent over the forecast period. Membersrecalled the domestic and international experience prior to the pandemic, which suggested that asustained period of labour market tightness would be needed to generate the faster wages growth requiredto see inflation return to the 2 to 3 per cent target range. Headline year-endedinflation was expected to increase temporarily to around 3 per cent in the June quarter 2021,largely reflecting swings in the prices of child care, automotive fuel and some other administeredprices. It was then forecast to fall back below 2 per cent by the end of the year and staybelow 2 per cent over the remainder of the forecast period.", "Given the high degree of uncertainty around the outlook, members considered 2 plausiblealternative scenarios around the baseline forecast. In the baseline forecast, no further significantoutbreaks of the virus were assumed to occur in Australia, although there could be some smalleroutbreaks on the scale seen in recent months. Restrictions on domestic activity were assumed to be easedover the course of the year. Australia's international borders were assumed to remain closed untilat least the end of the year.", "A downside scenario was considered by members, where further large outbreaks of the virus required thereimposition of restrictions on activity, although not the extended lockdowns contemplated in previousdownside scenarios. Weaker activity would see the unemployment rate remain around6¾ per cent for most of 2021 and then decline only gradually thereafter. The largerdegree of spare capacity in the labour market would be expected to place further downward pressure onwages growth and keep inflation trending lower until mid 2022.", "A plausible upside scenario was also discussed by members, which assumed that a run of positive healthoutcomes domestically and abroad enabled a faster easing of restrictions on activity. This would boosthousehold and business confidence and, with it, private spending and investment. The stronger profilefor activity in this scenario would lead to a faster decline in the unemployment rate, which would fallto below 5 per cent by the end of 2022. Inflation would also rise a little faster in thisscenario, but even still it would approach 2 per cent only by the end of the forecastperiod."], "International financial markets": ["Members noted that global financial market conditions had remained very accommodative and monetarystimulus was expected to remain in place for some time. In the advanced economies, several centralbanks, including the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and Sweden'sRiksbank, had recently indicated that they would increase the size and/or extend the timeframe of theirasset purchase programs. A number of central banks had also introduced lending facilities or enhancedexisting facilities to support the flow of credit to the real economy. Members observed that the size ofthe Bank's balance sheet relative to GDP remained lower than that of most other advanced economycentral banks.", "Long-term government bond yields had increased over the preceding couple of months in most advancedeconomies, reflecting the upgraded growth outlook related to the rollout of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> vaccines and expected fiscal stimulus measures, notably in the UnitedStates. Much of the increase in bond yields had reflected an increase in the compensation for inflationsought by investors. Members observed that government borrowing costs had remained low across advancedeconomies and issuance had continued to be met by strong demand.", "Corporate funding conditions had also remained highly accommodative and borrowing costs had remainedaround record lows. Investor confidence had been buoyed by the rollout of vaccines, new fiscal stimulusmeasures and sustained monetary stimulus, despite the challenges of rising <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases in some countries. Credit spreads had narrowed further and equityprices had increased. US equity prices had increased by more than in many other countries, partlyreflecting the higher share of technology-related stocks in US equity indices.", "The US dollar had depreciated further in response to the improvement in the medium-term globalgrowth outlook. Commodity prices had also increased against this backdrop and the Australian dollar hadappreciated back to around 2018 levels in trade-weighted terms. Members observed that, nonetheless, theadditional monetary policy stimulus as a result of the Bank's package of policy measures announcedin November 2020 had contributed to the Australian dollar being noticeably lower than it would have beenotherwise."], "Domestic financial markets": ["In Australia, the Bank's package of policy measures announced in November 2020 had led to afurther easing of financial conditions. The cash rate had declined to 3 basis points and othershort-term money market rates had also declined to be close to zero.", "The 3-year Australian Government bond yield had been at the target of around 10 basis points,supported by bond purchases on several occasions in mid November and early December. The Bank washalfway through the $100 billion bond purchase program. While longer-dated Australian Governmentbond yields had increased since early December, this largely reflected international developments andthe yield differential to US Treasuries had been broadly stable over that period. Staff estimatessuggested that longer-term Australian Government bond yields were around 30 basis points lowerthan otherwise as a result of the bond purchase program. Members noted that government bond markets inAustralia continued to function smoothly for both Australian Government bonds and semis.", "After drawing down the bulk of initial Term Funding Facility (TFF) allowances by the end-Septemberdeadline, banks had since drawn down only a small share of their additional and supplementary TFFallowances. Similar to the initial allowance period, further TFF drawings were expected to pick uptowards the end of the remaining drawdown period, which would finish in June 2021.", "Reductions in money market rates and retail deposit rates had further reduced banks' fundingcosts. Borrowing rates for households and businesses had also declined to new lows. Reductions inborrowing rates since November had mostly been for fixed-rate home loans and for business loans underthe government's small and medium-sized enterprises loan guarantee scheme. The average rate paidon outstanding variable-rate housing loans had continued to drift gradually lower, reflecting ongoingcompetition for new high-quality borrowers and the effect of borrowers refinancing their loans.", "Funding conditions for Australian non-financial firms had remained highly accommodative. Creditspreads had narrowed further and Australian firms had been able to increase the tenor of their bondissuance in 2020. Equity prices had increased a little further since early December. While the ASX200 had risen noticeably since March 2020 – with a significant contribution from resourcecompanies reflecting higher commodity prices – it had remained around 5 per cent belowits peak early in 2020.", "Demand for housing finance had continued to pick up over preceding months, especially fromowner-occupiers. New housing loan commitments for owner-occupiers had increased to be well above theprevious high in 2017. Investor housing loan commitments had also increased somewhat, but remained wellbelow earlier peaks. Members noted that demand for new business loans had remained subdued, includingfor small and medium-sized enterprises."], "Considerations for monetary policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy hadimproved over prior months owing to the development of vaccines. At the same time, the global recoveryhad lost some momentum around the turn of the year, as <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases hadsurged again in many countries. The global outlook remained dependent on the path of the pandemic and onsignificant fiscal and monetary support. The recovery was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, and mosteconomies were expected to be well below their pre-pandemic trajectories for the level of output forsome time. Inflation remained low and below central bank targets in many economies.", "In Australia, the economic recovery was well under way and had been stronger than expected previously.There had been strong growth in employment and a welcome decline in the unemployment rate. Theseoutcomes had been underpinned by Australia's success on the health front and the very significantfiscal and monetary support. An important near-term issue was how households and businesses would adjustto the tapering of some fiscal support measures and to what extent they would use their stronger balancesheets to support spending. Members agreed that, while the recovery was expected to continue, the levelof output remained noticeably below its pre-pandemic trajectory. The high unemployment rate andconsiderable spare capacity were expected to result in subdued wages growth and inflation over comingyears.", "The Bank's policy actions to date had been working broadly as expected. Together, the bondpurchases, the TFF and the targets for the 3-year bond yield and the cash rate were helping the economyby lowering financing costs for borrowers, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise,supporting the supply of credit and supporting housing and business balance sheets. Since the start of2020, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $160 billion and a further substantialincrease was in prospect. The Bank had bought a cumulative $52 billion of government bonds issuedby the Australian Government and the states and territories under the bond purchase program. The Bankhad not purchased bonds in support of the 3-year yield target since early December 2020. Authoriseddeposit-taking institutions had drawn down $86 billion of low-cost funding through the TFF and hadaccess to a further $99 billion under the facility. Members noted that the Australian bankingsystem, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping to supportthe economic recovery.", "The Board remained committed to doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy, anddecided to maintain the existing policy settings. Members concluded that very significant monetarysupport would be required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's goals forinflation and unemployment were achieved. Given this, it would be premature to consider withdrawingmonetary stimulus.", "Members discussed the bond purchase program, which was scheduled to be completed in mid April 2021.They considered 3 factors: the effectiveness of the bond purchases; the decisions of other centralbanks; and, most importantly, the outlook for inflation and employment. The Board assessed that the bondpurchase program had helped to lower interest rates and had contributed to a lower exchange rate thanotherwise. Australia's government bond markets continued to function well and further purchaseswere not expected to be a source of market dysfunction.", "A number of central banks in other advanced economies had announced extensions of their bond purchaseprograms to at least the end of 2021, and there was a widespread expectation among market participantsthat the Bank's program would be extended in some way. Given this, if the Bank were to cease bondpurchases in April, it was likely that there would be unwelcome significant upward pressure on theexchange rate. Members discussed the outlook for the economy and concluded that it would be some yearsbefore the goals for inflation and unemployment were achieved. In view of these considerations, and thefact that the cash rate was at its effective lower bound, the Board resolved to purchase an additional$100 billion of bonds issued by the Australian Government and states and territories following thecompletion of the existing bond purchase program in mid April. These additional purchases would be atthe same rate of $5 billion per week, allocated on the same basis, namely around80 per cent Australian Government Securities and around 20 per cent bonds issued bythe states and territories. The decision to extend the bond purchase program would ensure a continuationof the Bank's monetary support for the Australian economy.", "Members reviewed the operation of the TFF and agreed that it had worked as intended by reducingborrowing costs and supporting the flow of credit, including for small and medium-sized enterprises. TheBoard decided to maintain the existing terms of the facility. Banks will be able to draw on the facilityuntil the end of June 2021, and continue to benefit from this low-cost funding through to mid 2024.The Board would consider extending the facility if there were a marked deterioration in funding andcredit conditions in the Australian financial system. However, there had not been signs of such adeterioration recently.", "Members also discussed the operation of the target for the 3-year Australian Government bond yield.This target had been effective in lowering short-term interest rates, which matter most for privateborrowing and lending decisions. The target had also helped to anchor the Australian yield curve, andreinforced the Bank's forward guidance regarding the cash rate. The Board determined that the3-year yield target would be maintained. Later in the year, the Board would need to consider whether toshift the focus of the yield target from the April 2024 bond to the November 2024 bond. In consideringthis issue, members would give close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlook forinflation and employment.", "Members also discussed the effect that low interest rates have on financial and macroeconomicstability. They acknowledged the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rateenvironment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housingmarket. The Board concluded that there were greater benefits for financial stability from a strongereconomy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.", "Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long asnecessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will notincrease the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per centtarget range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently.This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board doesnot expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest."], "The decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:", "The Board agreed to purchase an additional $100 billion of government bonds when the existing bondpurchase program is completed in mid April 2021. These additional purchases will be at the same rate of$5 billion per week."]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 6 March 2012"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury), John Akehurst, Jillian Broadbent AO, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Heather Ridout, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Malcolm Edey (Assistant Governor, Financial System), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Jonathan Kearns (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that recent indicators of global economic activity had picked up modestly after softening in late 2011, though sovereign debt concerns in Europe continued to weigh on the outlook. Conditions in most euro area sovereign debt markets had improved over the month and some progress had been made, with agreement on the Greek bailout package lowering the near-term probability of a severe financial event that many had feared late last year. Economic activity in Europe had been weak, but activity in the United States appeared to have picked up a little. Conditions had remained generally firm in China, but slowing exports to Europe and the disruption to supply chains from the floods in Thailand had weighed on activity in much of east Asia, though there were tentative signs that activity and exports had picked up since December. ", " Despite data on the Chinese economy being more difficult to read than usual owing to the early timing of the Lunar New Year, it appeared that the Chinese authorities had been successful in slowing growth to a more sustainable pace. The property market remained subdued, in large part reflecting administrative controls, including restrictions on access to credit by property developers and limits on purchases by existing property owners. These measures were having their intended effect of reducing property prices, but affordability for new buyers remained a concern of the central government. The People's Bank of China reduced reserve requirements again in February to offset a tightening in liquidity conditions. ", " The US economy had emerged from its soft patch in mid 2011. The labour market had showed further signs of improvement, as indicated by the trend decline in initial jobless claims to levels last seen in 2008. Housing activity had also shown some improvement, albeit from a low base. Even so, house prices had displayed little, if any, sign of recovery and the foreclosure process still appeared to have some way to go. Members noted that economic recoveries from financial crises tended to be slower, and that fiscal consolidation was also likely to be a drag on growth in coming years. ", " While output in the euro area fell in the last quarter of 2011, some indicators suggested signs of stabilisation in early 2012. Despite the slight improvement, sovereign debt concerns and fiscal consolidation efforts were seen as likely to continue to weigh on economic activity for the foreseeable future. The divergence across euro area economies remained marked, with indicators of activity having held up better in northern European economies. ", " As expected, the Australian terms of trade had declined from their peak in the September quarter, reflecting the fall in bulk commodity prices, but remained at historically high levels. Overall, commodity prices were broadly unchanged over the previous month. In contrast, oil prices had risen by around 7 per cent since early February owing to geopolitical tensions and increased demand, because of both the especially cold weather in Europe at the beginning of the year and the improvement in the US economy. Members noted that an increase in the price of oil related to supply concerns would be more contractionary for the global economy than the increases over the past decade when the price had risen in response to strong demand. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the various forces shaping the Australian economy had resulted in divergent conditions across sectors. On the one hand, the terms of trade boom had underpinned strong investment in mining-related sectors. Investment intentions also remained strong, with the capital expenditure survey suggesting investment in the mining sector in 2012/13 would be well above the already elevated levels. Reflecting strong mining investment and the high exchange rate, the volume of capital imports was estimated to have increased by around 40 per cent over 2011. On the other hand, the associated high exchange rate had weighed on other trade-exposed sectors, including manufacturing, tourism and education, with services exports having fallen significantly since 2008. Investment intentions in the non-mining sectors remained subdued. ", " A survey-based measure of consumer confidence rose to around average levels in February, although consumers' perceptions about their personal finances were still reported as below average, partly reflecting some concerns about prospects for unemployment and general uncertainty about the global outlook. Retail sales growth had softened since mid 2011, with notable weakness in parts of the industry, including department stores and retailers of household goods. The housing market remained soft, with auction clearance rates in February broadly unchanged from late 2011. Housing credit continued to grow at a slower rate than nominal income. ", " Members observed that the labour market reflected these opposing cross-currents in the Australian economy, with the manufacturing and retail sectors, for example, shedding labour, and the household services (particularly health services) and mining sectors recording solid increases in employment over the past year. These adjustments had broadly offset each other over the year, with little net employment growth in the economy. Members noted that population growth had slowed, reflecting a decline in the rate of immigration. In January, total employment grew by 46,000, broadly offsetting the decline in employment recorded late in 2011, and contributing to a small fall in the unemployment rate to 5.1 per cent. ", " Overall, wage growth remained firm although below the pace seen in the 2006–2008 period. Private-sector wages, as measured by the wage price index, grew by 1.0 per cent in the December quarter and by 3.8 per cent over the year, which was above the average over the past decade. Public-sector wage growth had slowed, in part reflecting delays in settling several new enterprise bargaining agreements.  "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion on financial markets by noting that conditions had continued to improve in February, supported by additional policy easing by a number of central banks and an agreement on the second Greek financial assistance package, although significant uncertainty about its implementation remained. ", " Under the second assistance package for Greece, the European Union and IMF would provide Greece with a further €130 billion in loans. One important pre-condition was a restructuring of private-sector holdings of Greek debt with a haircut of effectively more than 70 per cent, which was to occur later in the week. Other key near-term policy actions included more expenditure cuts, tax administration reform, reductions in labour costs, and legislation to enhance bank restructuring and recapitalisation. As a result of these actions, Greece's public debt-to-GDP ratio was projected to be around 120 per cent by 2020, though this projection was subject to a large degree of uncertainty. ", " The European Central Bank had undertaken its second three-year liquidity operation in which it provided €530 billion in (secured) loans. This, together with the €490 billion provided in its first liquidity operation, left European banks well positioned to fund their bond maturities for at least the first half of this year. As these bonds mature, the need for investors to reinvest the funds could provide a further boost to other asset markets. Pressures on European banks' total balance sheets, including US dollar assets and liabilities, had also eased recently. A key question remained as to whether these developments would increase the capacity and willingness of European banks to lend. ", " The Bank of England and Bank of Japan had undertaken further quantitative easing of monetary policy, announcing increases in their respective asset purchase programs. The Bank of Japan also introduced an explicit medium-term inflation goal. Following the announcement, the yen depreciated by around 5 per cent both against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms, after having generally moved sideways from around the middle of 2011. ", " The Australian dollar rose further over the past month, to around its highest level in trade weighted terms since early 1985 and only a little below its post-float high against the US dollar. The dollar's strength reflected ongoing foreign interest in Australian government debt, given the shrinking global pool of high-quality assets. Interest in Australian state government debt had picked up recently, with spreads narrowing, though this interest appeared to have come largely from domestic sources. ", " Reflecting the further improvement in sentiment, global equity markets had risen by almost 10 per cent since the beginning of the year. The main US index was at its highest level since mid 2008, and only 13 per cent below its 2007 peak, although other equity markets, including in Australia, were still well below their pre-crisis levels. Members noted that the relative weakness in the Australian market was due to several factors, including a larger weighting on the mining sector, which had tended to underperform broader indices in most economies over the past year. ", " Following the Board's decision at the February meeting to leave the cash rate unchanged, most lenders had raised their housing indicator rates, by an average of around 10 basis points. Conditions in local credit markets continued to improve and the banks issued $12 billion in bonds in February, with two-thirds of that debt unsecured, and sizeable issuance had continued in early March. Members noted that the relative cost of issuance had continued to decline since the beginning of the year, though it remained higher than in mid 2011. ", " At present, the Australian market was pricing in a small chance of a policy easing in March. In contrast to late 2011, when the market expected the cash rate to be lowered to 2¾ per cent by late 2012, the market now expected the cash rate to decline from 4¼ per cent to around 3¾ per cent by the end of the year. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. The escalation in sovereign debt problems in the euro area over the second half of 2011 had largely reflected market concerns about debt sustainability in a wider group of countries, particularly Italy and Spain. This turbulence spread to global financial markets, leading to tighter wholesale funding conditions for banks in many countries, including Australia. Even though conditions in financial markets had improved since late December, the ongoing difficulties in Europe, as well as the subdued outlook for global growth, continued to pose risks to global financial stability in the period ahead. ", " Members noted that the Australian banking system remained in a relatively strong condition. The larger banks were in a better position than a few years ago to cope with the tighter funding conditions given the improvements made to their funding, liquidity and capital positions. Their wholesale funding task had also become more manageable, with deposit growth continuing to outpace growth in bank credit by a wide margin. Banks' non performing asset levels had come down a little recently, but remained elevated, especially for business loans. Overall, the Australian banks had continued to record robust profits, although the slow credit growth environment was likely to constrain the pace of future profit growth. ", " The household sector had continued to show a more cautious approach towards its finances in recent years, thereby helping to improve its resilience to possible shocks. The household saving rate had remained higher at around 10 per cent, and members discussed the apparent shift towards more conservative investment preferences as well as the decision of many households to repay their debt more quickly than required. Strong income growth had also helped to increase households' debt-servicing capacity. As a result, aggregate measures of household financial stress remained low, though mortgage arrears rates remained somewhat higher than a few years ago. ", " Conditions continued to vary significantly across the business sector, with the divergent experiences helping to explain why banks' non-performing business loans and business failure rates were somewhat higher than average. Overall, though, the business sector was in a better financial position than several years ago, having delevered considerably and improved its liquidity position. Members were informed that while business credit had picked up somewhat recently, demand for debt overall remained subdued. The commercial property market, traditionally a source of vulnerability for banks, had continued to improve after the recent downturn, though construction activity remained muted and financing activity weak. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that the past month had seen an improvement in the prospects for the global economy, with European policymakers making progress in addressing the region's debt and financial problems. Major downside risks were seen to remain, but the probability of a very bad outcome in the near future had receded a little further. ", " At the same time, the domestic economy continued to undergo significant structural adjustment in response to the very high terms of trade and the accompanying high exchange rate. A key question was whether the necessary adjustment was occurring at an overall pace of growth that kept the economy close to trend and inflation close to target. In this regard, most information thus far had indicated that weakness in parts of the economy – including manufacturing, building construction and parts of the retail sector – was being approximately balanced by the strength in the mining sector and some services industries. ", " Inflation in underlying terms was around the midpoint of the target range and was expected to remain within the target range over the forecast horizon. Members observed that this forecast was reliant on some improvement in productivity growth to hold down domestic cost pressures. ", " Over the month, the major banks had passed on some of their higher funding cost pressures that had been building since mid 2011. The increases were relatively small, largely confined to housing loan interest rates, and did not materially change the current stance of monetary policy. Following the two reductions in the cash rate late last year, lending rates, including for businesses, were around average levels. ", " The clearest downside risk to the outlook for Australia remained a sudden worsening in the situation in Europe and its flow-on effects to the rest of the world through trade, financial and confidence channels. Members noted that a sharp slowdown, particularly in east Asia, would have significant implications for commodity prices and demand for Australian exports. A major flight from risk in global capital markets would see significant changes in credit conditions, the exchange rate and confidence. So long as inflation remained well contained, there would be ample scope for the Bank to ease policy in such a scenario. Overall, members noted that while this downside risk could still materialise, this seemed somewhat less likely than a few months ago. ", " Members were also alert to the uncertainties inherent in assessing the response of the domestic economy to the disparate forces at work, including the very large rise in resources investment and the high exchange rate. To date, the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and inflation broadly consistent with the medium-term target. ", " On balance, the Board considered that it was appropriate for interest rates to be around their average levels, which was judged to be the case at present. The Board would continue to monitor both how the global economy evolved and the course of domestic economic activity and prices.

Growth in major trading partners was forecast to be around trend in 2019 and 2020. However, the downside risks to the global outlook had increased in the preceding few months. Members noted that it was difficult to predict the effectiveness of recent policy measures in China and how the authorities would balance their objectives of supporting growth and containing financial risks. Trade tensions and signs of slowing domestic demand had also increased the risks to the outlook for China. More broadly, trade tensions remained a material risk to the global growth outlook. ", " US exports to China and Chinese exports to the United States had fallen sharply in late 2018 as a result of earlier tariff increases. There had been ongoing speculation that the United States might impose tariffs on automotive imports, which would affect imports from Germany and Japan. Some economies, particularly in the east Asian region, had been affected by the trade tensions because they provide inputs to Chinese exports as part of global supply chains. A number of economies had also faced a moderation in export growth because Chinese domestic demand had slowed. However, members noted that there had also been reports of firms accelerating existing plans to shift production from China to other low-cost producers in the east Asian region. ", " Labour markets had tightened further in most advanced economies and wages growth had increased. Core inflation had picked up to be close to target in some advanced economies, but remained low in others. Headline inflation had declined towards the end of 2018 because oil prices had fallen by almost 30 per cent from their peak in October. ", " GDP growth in the United States had remained strong over 2018. Fiscal stimulus and strong employment growth had supported consumption growth. The labour market had continued to tighten in early 2019 and wages growth had picked up. However, the outlook for investment had softened. Some measures of business and consumer confidence had fallen sharply in January. However, members noted that it was difficult to determine whether this reflected uncertainty associated with volatility in financial markets or a genuine deterioration in the circumstances facing businesses and consumers. ", " GDP growth in Japan was expected to recover after the sharp slowing in the September quarter, which had mainly reflected disruptions from natural disasters. Growth in consumption had been supported by a strong labour market and a pick-up in wages growth. Members noted that consumption would receive a short-term boost as consumers brought forward spending ahead of an increase in the consumption tax in October. Recent data suggested that business conditions in Japan had also remained positive. By contrast, growth in output in the euro area had slowed over 2018, reflecting a combination of weaker external demand, especially from China, and some localised factors that could have persistent effects, particularly if they were not resolved quickly. Investment intentions and surveyed business conditions had fallen recently in the euro area. ", " GDP growth in China had slowed in 2018, as had been expected given the earlier tightening in financial conditions. However, there were signs that underlying momentum in the Chinese economy had slowed by more than suggested by the GDP data. The authorities had responded with further targeted policy measures. Many of these measures were aimed at encouraging spending on infrastructure, which had led to a lift in growth in public infrastructure investment and an upgrade to the outlook for steel demand. In India, crude steel production had remained high in 2018, despite an easing in GDP growth overall. ", " The improved outlook for steel demand and stockpiling ahead of the Chinese New Year had supported prices for iron ore at the end of 2018, and earlier increases in oil prices had boosted liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices. As a result, Australia's terms of trade were expected to have increased in the December quarter. Iron ore prices had increased further in 2019, following the collapse of a tailings dam at an iron ore mine in Brazil and the subsequent closure of a number of other similar mines. Members observed that iron ore prices could remain high for some time, but prices were still expected to decline over the medium term. Looking ahead, the effect of higher iron ore prices on the terms of trade was expected to be offset by the effect of lower prices for LNG, as the decline in oil prices since October gradually feeds through. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The September quarter national accounts had been released the day after the December meeting. Members noted that growth in real GDP of 0.3 per cent in the quarter and 2.8 per cent over the year had been noticeably below expectations. There had also been downward revisions to GDP growth in previous quarters, which had subtracted around ¼ percentage point from the year-ended growth rate. Taking account of this and other information, the Bank had revised down its forecast for growth in the Australian economy by around ¼ percentage point for both 2019 and 2020. This primarily reflected a modest downgrading of the outlook for household consumption and residential construction. The outlook had also become more uncertain over the preceding few months. ", " Growth in GDP was expected to be around 3 per cent over 2019, supported by accommodative monetary policy and ongoing strength in public spending and business investment. Further gradual tightening in the labour market was expected to support growth in household income and consequently growth in household consumption. GDP growth was expected to moderate to 2¾ per cent over 2020 because LNG output was expected to reach targeted levels of production and would therefore no longer materially add to growth. Dwelling investment was also expected to decline more sharply than previously expected, consistent with the decline in residential building approvals and the fall in housing prices. ", " Growth in consumption had slowed to 2½ per cent over the year to the September quarter. Revisions to previously published data made it difficult to assess the underlying momentum of consumption over the preceding year. On balance, the slower reported growth in consumption, together with subdued growth in retail sales in the December quarter and the likely effect of lower housing prices and reduced housing market activity on consumption, warranted a downward revision to the outlook for consumption. As a result, year-ended growth in consumption was expected to pick up only a little over the forecast period. Members noted that uncertainty about the recent momentum of consumption and factors affecting households' future consumption decisions remained a key risk for the domestic economic outlook. ", " Dwelling investment was likely to have been close to its peak in the second half of 2018. Although there was still a large pipeline of residential work to be done and few signs that projects already under way were being cancelled, it had become more difficult for new apartment projects to obtain finance, and building approvals were the lowest they had been for five years. As a result, dwelling investment was expected to remain at a high level in the near term, but then to decline faster than previously expected. Members noted the uncertainty about the extent and speed of the downturn in the dwelling investment cycle. ", " Non-mining investment had been flat in the September quarter. Non-residential construction had declined, but the pipeline of work yet to be done had remained relatively high, suggesting that non-residential construction would recover in coming quarters. Investment in machinery &amp; equipment and computer software had grown solidly in the September quarter. A reasonably positive outlook for investment was supported by continued growth in corporate profits and accommodative financial conditions for larger firms, although conditions for smaller firms had been more constrained. While information from liaison implied that the economy had reasonable momentum around the turn of the year, surveyed business conditions had declined to around their long-run average. A large pipeline of projects was expected to support growth in public investment over the following year. ", " Mining investment had fallen in the September quarter. Liaison had suggested that very little additional spending was needed to bring the remaining LNG projects on line. Mining investment was expected to increase over the forecast period as mining firms invest to maintain production; this outlook was supported by mining firms' profitability having remained strong. Members noted that the declines in mining investment that had weighed on growth for the previous six years were close to an end, and instead mining investment was expected to make a small contribution to output growth in the forecast period. Recent trade data suggested that supply disruptions had continued to affect resource exports in the December quarter. ", " Farm output had fallen by 8 per cent over the year to the September quarter, subtracting around ¼ percentage point from year-ended GDP growth. Members noted that the outlook for the farm sector continued to depend on the timing and magnitude of rainfall; drier-than-average conditions in key farming areas were expected to continue in the near term. Recent trade data suggested that rural exports had fallen in the December quarter, and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences had revised down its forecast for farm production in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2018/19</span>. ", " Members noted the continued improvement in conditions in the labour market and that the labour market data had been stronger than other data on economic activity. Employment had continued to grow faster than the working-age population in the December quarter, with most of this growth in full-time employment. Forward-looking indicators had been consistent with above-average employment growth over the first half of 2019. The unemployment rate had declined to 5 per cent, which was the lowest rate since 2011 and lower than had been expected a year earlier. Labour market conditions had been particularly strong in New South Wales and Victoria, where unemployment rates had fallen to be between 4 and 4½ per cent. The national unemployment rate was expected to edge a little lower to around 4¾ per cent over the following few years. Tightening labour market conditions were expected to put upward pressure on wages, although to date wages growth in Australia and elsewhere had been slower to pick up than in previous expansions. ", " Turning to the latest data on inflation, members noted that inflation had remained low in the December quarter, with both headline and underlying inflation a little under ½ per cent in the quarter and around 1¾ per cent over the year. Headline inflation had been lower than forecast, largely because fuel prices had been lower than expected in the quarter. Domestic cost pressures had been relatively subdued, partly because wages growth had remained low. More recently, utilities prices had increased only modestly, after substantial increases in previous years, and inflation in the prices of other administered services had declined noticeably as a result of government pricing decisions. ", " Strong competition in the retail sector had continued to dampen inflation, although deflationary pressures in the retail sector appeared to have eased somewhat in the December quarter. This could have reflected some pass-through of the modest depreciation of the Australian dollar over 2018. The drought had also contributed to higher retail inflation for food, particularly meat. ", " Inflation in rents had remained subdued and data on newly advertised rents suggested there was little prospect of a pick-up in the near term. Rent inflation had started to trend lower in Sydney, where the rental vacancy rate had risen and was expected to rise further in the near term as more supply becomes available. Rents in Perth had fallen further, although the pace of deflation had eased. Inflation in the cost of new housing construction had trended lower, despite the high level of dwelling investment. ", " Members noted that the inflation outcome for the December quarter had been fairly close to expectations. However, the forecast pick-up in underlying inflation was now expected to occur a little later than previously expected, mainly as a result of the lower forecast for growth in GDP and downside risks to utilities and administered price inflation in the near term. Underlying inflation was expected to increase to 2 per cent by the end of 2019 (previously by mid 2019) and to reach 2¼ per cent by the end of 2020. Headline inflation was expected to fall to 1¼ per cent in mid 2019 as a result of the fall in fuel prices since the December quarter, on the assumption the lower oil price is sustained. ", " Members spent some time considering a paper on the implications of recent developments in housing markets for the economic outlook. After rising by almost 50 per cent over the five years to September 2017, national housing prices had fallen by around 8 per cent to be back around mid-2016 levels. Members noted the significantly different developments in housing prices across the country. Housing prices had fallen by 12 per cent in Sydney and by 9 per cent in Melbourne from their peaks in 2017. There had also been significant falls in housing prices in Perth and Darwin over recent years. By contrast, housing prices in Hobart and Canberra had increased over 2018, while housing prices in Adelaide, Brisbane and many regional centres had been flat. Members noted that the cumulative falls in housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne were relatively large by historical standards, and that it was unusual for housing prices to fall significantly in an environment of low mortgage interest rates and a declining unemployment rate. ", " Members noted that some of the dynamics in housing prices could be explained by the fact that the supply of housing does not respond quickly to changes in demand. In particular, the run-up in housing prices had occurred during a period when housing supply had not picked up sufficiently to match higher demand from more rapid population growth. Over time, higher housing prices had eventually led to a sizeable increase in supply, but this had taken longer than in previous cycles. Another factor weighing on prices was a noticeable decline in demand from foreign buyers in recent years, which had also been apparent in housing markets in some other economies. ", " Rental vacancy rates are one key indicator of the balance of supply and demand in the housing market. In most states, rental vacancies had been around or somewhat below average at the end of 2018, suggesting supply and demand for housing had been roughly balanced. In Melbourne, despite the fall in prices and large increase in supply, the vacancy rate had declined. By contrast, rental vacancies in Sydney had been increasing and advertised rents had fallen. ", " Members also noted that housing credit growth had declined further in preceding months and that there had been a notable drop in loan approvals by the major banks. Growth in lending to investors had slowed sharply since mid 2017 to be close to zero, while growth in lending to owner-occupiers had moderated to around 5½ per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms. ", " The slower growth in lending for housing over the preceding year appeared to reflect weaker demand. Nevertheless, credit conditions for some borrowers had remained tighter than they had been for some time following the strengthening of lending policies and practices over recent years. Liaison with mortgage brokers suggested that the increased public scrutiny associated with the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry may have led some individual loan assessors at banks to apply stricter criteria than specified in official lending requirements. However, banks reported that while loan assessors had been referring more approvals to credit officers, final loan approval rates had remained high. Moreover, lenders had continued to compete for borrowers of high credit quality by offering new loans at lower interest rates than those offered on existing loans. ", " From a longer-run perspective, members assessed that, following such large increases in housing prices, the effect of the recent price falls on overall economic activity was expected to be relatively small. However, members observed that if prices were to fall much further, consumption could be weaker than forecast, which would result in lower GDP growth, higher unemployment and lower inflation than forecast. From a financial stability perspective, tighter lending standards, an improving labour market and low interest rates were all likely to support households' capacity to service their debt. Few households were in negative equity positions despite the falls in housing prices, implying that banks' losses would be limited even if household financial stress were to become more widespread. "], "Financial Markets": [" Turning to other financial market developments, members observed that while housing credit growth had declined, business credit growth had strengthened over 2018, with contributions from the foreign banks and the major banks. However, this growth had been driven by increased lending to large businesses. ", " Members observed that conditions had tightened somewhat in a number of Australian financial markets, in line with global developments. Spreads of bank bond yields to Australian government bonds had widened a little, reflecting a global rise in risk premiums. Nevertheless, yields on bank bonds were little changed around the level of the preceding few years, given the decline in Australian government bond yields. Australian equity prices had declined in the December quarter along with global equity markets, but had recovered in January to be back around their October levels. Members noted that share prices of Australian banks had risen on the morning of the meeting, following the release of the final report of the royal commission and the Government's response the preceding afternoon. ", " Money market interest rates had remained higher than a year earlier, contributing to a small increase in banks' funding costs over the period since then. In response, most lenders had increased their standard variable mortgage interest rates a little since mid 2018. However, the effect of rising standard variable rates had been partly offset by borrowers refinancing at lower rates, given the strong competition for low-risk borrowers. Members noted that, overall, mortgage interest rates remained relatively low. ", " Turning to global financial markets, members observed that financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent months in most advanced economies, with increased volatility and a general rise in equity and credit risk premiums. Nevertheless, there had been a partial retracement of the tightening in recent weeks and financial conditions remained accommodative. ", " At its January meeting, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had left the federal funds rate unchanged and removed its forward guidance for further interest rate increases. The FOMC had emphasised that it would be patient in making any future adjustments to the federal funds rate, and that future monetary policy decisions would be more closely guided by the incoming data because interest rates were closer to estimates of neutral. The FOMC had also indicated that it would be open to slowing the pace of its planned balance sheet reduction if warranted by economic or market developments. Financial market pricing had shifted to imply that the next move in the federal funds rate was expected to be down, although this was not expected to occur until at least late 2020. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were expected to maintain their stimulatory policy settings for an extended period. ", " Members noted that government bond yields had declined across the major global markets over the preceding two months, reflecting the downward shift in expectations for future policy rates, along with a fall in compensation for future inflation following falls in oil prices. These changes had also reflected increased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for global growth. Australian government bond yields had declined broadly in line with global developments, with long-term government bond yields in Australia remaining around 50 basis points below those in the United States. ", " There had been a modest depreciation of the US dollar in nominal trade-weighted terms since late 2018, reflecting the more noticeable shift in the outlook for monetary policy in the United States than in other major economies. Members noted that the depreciation had been more pronounced against the Japanese yen, which had appreciated to around its highest level in two years on a trade-weighted basis. The Chinese renminbi had also appreciated modestly over the preceding month, reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar as well as signs of some progress on US–China trade negotiations. ", " The Australian dollar had depreciated a little further in nominal trade-weighted terms over the preceding two months, largely reflecting the appreciation of the yen and renminbi. However, overall, the Australian dollar had remained within the range observed over the preceding few years. Members observed that there had been two broadly offsetting influences on the Australian dollar exchange rate over the preceding year: the increase in commodity prices and the terms of trade had been supporting the Australian dollar over this period, while the relative decline in Australian government bond yields had been working in the opposite direction. ", " In global capital markets, corporate bond spreads had risen in recent months and bond issuance had eased, particularly for lower-rated borrowers. There had been some retracement of the increase in corporate borrowing costs in early 2019. Similarly, global equity markets had declined sharply in late 2018, before recovering somewhat since. The widening in credit spreads and decline in equity prices had reflected lower expectations for corporate earnings growth, as well as a rise in the risk premium demanded by investors. However, members observed that overall borrowing costs for corporations had remained low as a result of low government bond yields, and the corrections in these markets had followed an extended period of elevated valuations, particularly in the United States. ", " In China, the authorities had implemented further targeted measures to support lending to private firms, particularly small-sized enterprises, in the context of slowing economic growth. These firms' access to finance had been tightened over the course of 2018 as a result of earlier measures by the authorities to reduce risks in the financial system by restricting the availability of ‘shadow finance’. Since the latter part of 2018, the authorities had been encouraging banks to increase their lending to these types of firms, although members noted that larger banks were less accustomed to lending to this sector. ", " Members noted that conditions in other emerging markets had stabilised in recent months, following a tightening in conditions during 2018. Currencies had appreciated, equity prices had risen, bond spreads had narrowed and capital outflows had moderated across a number of emerging market economies. These developments had reflected policy adjustments in some countries, lower policy rate expectations in the United States and the associated depreciation of the US dollar, and, for oil-importing countries, the decline in oil prices. However, members noted that there remained a risk that financial conditions in emerging markets could tighten further. Concerns about trade tensions and a slowdown in growth, particularly in China, remained particularly important for emerging markets in Asia. ", " Financial market pricing implied that the Australian cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period, with some expectation of a decrease by late 2019. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that the global economy had continued to grow at an above-trend pace in 2018, although growth had moderated in some economies in the second half of the year. In particular, growth in China had slowed further and the authorities had continued to ease policy in a targeted way to support growth, while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector. Labour markets in the advanced economies had continued to tighten and wages growth had picked up. Core inflation had picked up in a number of economies, including the United States. Globally, lower oil prices had led to a decline in headline inflation. ", " Growth in Australia's major trading partners was expected to be around trend over the following year or so, but the downside risks had increased. Slowing growth in China and ongoing trade tensions had led to lower growth in global trade. Forecasters had lowered their outlook for global growth and market participants no longer expected a further tightening of monetary policy in the United States. Government bond yields had also declined in most countries, including Australia. More broadly, however, financial conditions had tightened somewhat in most major advanced economies, but remained accommodative. The terms of trade had remained above their trough in early 2016 and the Australian dollar had remained within its narrow range of recent times. ", " Domestically, growth in output had been weaker than expected in the September quarter. Nevertheless, growth was expected to be a little above trend over the forecast period. The outlook for business investment and spending on public infrastructure was positive. Growth in consumption was expected to be supported by a pick-up in growth in household disposable income, although recent data had prompted a downward revision to the consumption outlook. The outlook for consumption continued to be one of the key uncertainties for the forecasts for the domestic economy, given the environment of declining housing prices, low growth in household income and high debt levels. ", " Following a significant increase in construction activity and a large run-up in housing prices, housing markets were going through a period of adjustment. Housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne had declined further and the outlook for dwelling investment had been revised lower. In Sydney, rental vacancy rates had been increasing and rent inflation remained low across the country. Credit conditions had tightened for some borrowers and the demand for credit in the housing market, particularly by investors, had slowed noticeably as the dynamics of the housing market had changed. But housing lending rates had remained low and there was strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality. ", " The labour market had tightened further over 2018 and there had been some pick-up in wages growth. The unemployment rate had declined by ½ percentage point to 5 per cent, its lowest level in over seven years, and employment growth had been above average. The Bank's forecast was for the unemployment rate to decline a little further over the following few years. The vacancy rate was high and there were reports of skills shortages in some areas. Wages growth was expected to pick up gradually over the following year or so. ", " Inflation had remained low and stable in both headline and underlying terms over 2018. Underlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually over the forecast period, although headline inflation was expected to decline in the near term because of lower petrol prices. ", " Members noted that the sustained low level of interest rates over recent years had been supporting economic activity and had allowed for gradual progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. While the labour market had continued to strengthen over the preceding year, less progress had been made on inflation. Taking account of the available information on current economic and financial conditions, as well as the revised forecasts, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy should continue to allow for further gradual progress on both unemployment and inflation to be made. However, members noted that there were significant uncertainties around the forecasts, with scenarios where an increase in the cash rate would be appropriate at some point and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would be appropriate. Moreover, the probabilities around these scenarios were now more evenly balanced than they had been over the preceding year, when an eventual increase in the cash rate had appeared more likely. ", " Members would continue to assess the outlook carefully. However, given that further progress in reducing unemployment and lifting inflation was a reasonable expectation, members agreed that there was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, they assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while further progress unfolds. Members judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

The global economy had grown above trend in 2018, although it had slowed in the second half of the year and the more recent data that had been received had been consistent with a continuation of slower global growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 and early 2019, particularly in the euro area and parts of Asia. Notwithstanding the slower growth in output, labour markets in the major advanced economies had remained tight and there had been ongoing signs of upward pressure on wages. However, this had not translated into materially higher inflation. Core inflation had remained around target in the United States and a few other advanced economies, but had remained below target in many other economies. Headline inflation had generally declined because of the substantial fall in oil prices in late 2018. ", " Trade tensions had remained a continued source of uncertainty for the global outlook. The delay in tariff increases previously scheduled for 1 March had generated some optimism that tensions could ease. However, the increases in tariffs implemented in 2018 had continued to weigh on trade between the United States and China, and there had been spillover effects on some other economies. Notably, a decline in Chinese imports, both to meet domestic demand and facilitate export production, had been apparent in export growth in the September quarter in east Asia. Intra-regional export growth had also eased, although exports from east Asia to the major advanced economies had been relatively resilient, and survey measures of new export orders in east Asia had declined sharply to be below average early in 2019. The prospect of further tariff increases on automobile imports into the United States had received considerable media attention; Germany and Japan were likely to be particularly affected. ", " In the major advanced economies, GDP growth had diverged over 2018. The large fiscal stimulus had boosted GDP growth in the United States over 2018 to well above estimates of potential. Growth in consumption had been supported by strong employment growth and the pick-up in wages growth. Investment, particularly in machinery &amp; equipment and intellectual property, had also contributed significantly to growth in output. Key surveys of US manufacturing indicated that conditions had eased in recent months. ", " By contrast, growth in the euro area had eased in the second half of 2018. Members observed that this slowing had been quite broadly based across countries. Some of the loss of momentum had come from weaker external demand, particularly from China; survey measures of export orders suggested that the weakness in external demand had continued into early 2019. Disruptions to German automotive production related to compliance issues around emissions standards had also contributed to the weaker growth and, while these were expected to be temporary, they had persisted at least into January. ", " Output growth in Japan had picked up in the December quarter, following subdued growth in the September quarter, which was partly attributable to natural disasters. Members noted that domestic demand had held up well in Japan, despite weaker external demand, particularly from China. ", " In China, the authorities had announced a range of new fiscal easing measures and had also taken steps to ease financial conditions in recent months in response to concerns about slower growth in output in the second half of 2018. Members noted that the effect of this policy easing on economic activity was difficult to determine because the Chinese New Year holiday had affected the timing of data releases for January and February. The available data, such as surveys of business conditions, had pointed to subdued conditions in the manufacturing sector early in 2019. Price pressures had also remained low. ", " In commodity markets, the price of Brent crude oil had increased since the previous meeting, but remained around 25 per cent below its peak in October 2018. Coking coal prices had also risen since the previous meeting, reflecting disruptions to supply from Queensland. Iron ore prices had been little changed. The outlook for Australian coking and thermal coal prices had become more uncertain in light of reports that there had been an increase in customs processing times for Australian coal at some Chinese ports and a build-up of inventories. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members observed that labour market conditions had continued to improve, despite a slowing in the momentum of output growth in the second half of 2018. Members noted that the national accounts for the December quarter would be released the day after the meeting. They were expected to show that GDP growth over 2018 had been a little lower than anticipated at the time of the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, and were likely to confirm a markedly slower pace of growth in the second half of 2018 than in the first half. ", " Business investment was expected to have increased modestly in the December quarter, led by the non-mining sector. Mining investment was expected to have declined, consistent with the construction phase of the remaining liquefied natural gas projects nearing completion. ", " The ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey had provided an updated estimate of investment intentions for 2018/19 and the first estimate for 2019/20. ", " In the non mining sector, the Capex survey and other forward-looking indicators pointed to modest growth in investment over 2018/19. The gradual pick-up was projected to continue into 2019/20 for expenditure on buildings and structures. This projection was consistent with the high level of non-residential construction work yet to be done, although building approvals for non-residential construction had declined over preceding months. Members noted that activity in segments of the commercial property sector had been quite strong. Some of the recent strength in non-mining investment had been in structures, which includes investment in roads and renewable energy, and this was expected to continue. However, the Capex data suggested that there may be less expenditure on machinery &amp; equipment investment in the non-mining sector in 2019/20, although members noted that these early estimates were quite uncertain. Members also noted some of the limitations in the coverage of the Capex survey: it excludes the investment intentions of a range of sectors, including health and education, and investment in certain types of assets, such as computer software. More broadly, survey measures of business conditions had ticked up to be slightly above average across most states and industries in early 2019, but were lower than a year earlier. ", " The Capex data were consistent with mining investment reaching a trough in 2018/19 and increasing gradually in 2019/20 as firms invest to sustain production. This increase in sustaining investment was expected to support resource export volumes over the forecast period. By contrast, conditions in the agricultural sector were expected to remain difficult in the near term, limiting rural exports from some regions. Rainfall in south-eastern Queensland had been close to the lowest on record between December and February, at the same time as northern Queensland had experienced flooding. ", " The available data indicated that established housing prices in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth had declined further since the beginning of 2019, although both price and non-price indicators for housing were difficult to interpret during the seasonal lull in sales activity over January. In Sydney, housing prices were 13 per cent lower than their July 2017 peak, while in Melbourne housing prices were 10 per cent lower than their November 2017 peak. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had picked up over February. In Perth, housing prices had declined to 2006 levels, although rental vacancy rates had fallen to around average and newly advertised rents had been rising. Members noted that the Perth housing market was still adjusting to lower population growth and higher unemployment rates, but that the increase in mining investment was likely to have a positive effect. ", " Dwelling investment was expected to have decreased in the December quarter; preliminary data suggested that investment in both new dwellings and alterations and additions had declined in the quarter. Members noted that the pipeline of work to be done remained large and was expected to support dwelling investment through 2019, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. However, residential building approvals and information from the Bank's liaison program pointed to a marked slowing in dwelling investment in one to two years' time, unless pre-sales increased significantly in the following few quarters. The recent weakness in sales of detached new houses had been most pronounced in Sydney and Melbourne, but had also been evident in other locations. Contacts had reported that tighter access to credit for off-the-plan and project homes had been constraining buyer demand. ", " Consumption was expected to have contributed more to growth in the December quarter than in the September quarter, when consumption growth had been soft. Consumer sentiment had been broadly stable, supported by ongoing strength in the labour market, but the momentum in consumption growth had remained a key source of uncertainty given its variability over recent quarters. Retail sales volumes had increased by just 0.1 per cent in the December quarter and growth had eased to 1.6 per cent in year-ended terms. Information from liaison indicated that retail conditions had softened in December because some Christmas spending had been brought forward to November, but had remained stable since then. Growth in retail sales had been particularly weak in New South Wales and for large discretionary items such as household goods and furnishings. Members noted that sales of motor vehicles to households had also fallen over recent months. Some part of the slowdown in retail and motor vehicle spending in New South Wales was likely to have been related to declines in housing prices and, in particular, lower turnover in the housing market. Members noted that retail sales growth had not slowed to the same extent in Victoria despite similar declines in housing prices. ", " In contrast to the slowdown in GDP growth, conditions in the labour market had continued to improve. The national unemployment rate had been steady at 5.0 per cent in January, but had fallen to around 4 per cent in trend terms in New South Wales. The unemployment rate in Victoria had also declined to low levels, while the unemployment rate in Western Australia had increased in recent months to be around 6½ per cent. The heads-based underemployment rate had declined in trend terms to be around its mid-2014 levels. Employment had increased by 0.3 per cent in January and by 2.2 per cent over the preceding 12 months, which was well above growth in the working-age population. The number of full-time jobs had increased strongly in January, following a couple of months of small declines, and employment-to-population ratios had increased across most age categories. Members noted that both outcomes were consistent with strong labour market conditions. The participation rate had been stable at a high level. Overall, leading indicators continued to suggest that employment growth was likely to remain above average, although some indicators had turned down a little recently. ", " Growth in the wage price index (WPI) had been broadly as expected in the December quarter, and unchanged at 2.3 per cent over the year. Year-ended wages growth in the private sector had picked up to its fastest pace in four years. Members noted that this increase was more pronounced once bonuses and commissions were included. Wages growth had been higher than a year earlier in most industries and states. The strongest growth in wages had been in Victoria, at 2.7 per cent, consistent with the decline in the unemployment rate as well as relatively stronger public sector wage outcomes in that state. Growth in the WPI in Western Australia had remained low at 1.6 per cent over the year. Western Australia was the only state where year-ended wages growth had remained below 2 per cent. By industry, wages growth had been relatively weak in the retail, construction and professional, scientific &amp; technical industries, consistent with information from micro-level WPI data that wage freezes had been more common in these industries in recent years than had been the case previously. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that global financial conditions had generally eased in prior weeks, reflecting the recent moderation in market expectations for future central bank policy rates, some optimism around US–China trade negotiations and resilience in corporate earnings. The easing in financial conditions had also been seen in Australian markets. Members observed that overall financial conditions remained accommodative globally and in Australia. ", " Expectations for monetary policy in the advanced economies had been little changed over the month, following the downward shift in policy expectations around the turn of the year. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) officials had continued to state that, with the federal funds rate close to estimates of neutral, they will be patient in making any changes to policy and will be closely guided by incoming data. Members noted, however, that some FOMC officials had continued to indicate that US monetary policy might need to be tightened further. Financial market pricing indicated that the next move in the federal funds rate was expected to be down, although not until late 2020 or early 2021. Members noted, however, that this might reflect market participants' views that risks had become more skewed to the downside, rather than that an interest rate reduction was the most likely outcome. ", " Financial market pricing continued to indicate that accommodative monetary policy was expected to be maintained in the euro area and Japan for some time, with central bank officials having recently noted a weakening in the outlook for economic activity and inflation in those economies. ", " In Australia and New Zealand, financial market pricing indicated that policy rates were expected to be lowered by early 2020, following the earlier shift from expected future increases in policy rates. ", " Members noted that long-term bond yields in the major global markets remained below their levels late in 2018, consistent with the more subdued outlook for inflation and the lowering of expectations for future policy rates in the major advanced economies. Australian long-term bond yields had declined further in February, in line with the shift down in policy expectations following the previous meeting, to be at their lowest levels since late 2016. As a result, government bond yields in Australia had moved further below those in the United States. In China, long-term government bond yields had also declined over recent months in the context of the easing in financial conditions by the authorities. ", " Global equity markets had rebounded over the first two months of 2019, following a sharp fall in late 2018. Members observed that these swings in equity prices had been driven largely by shifting risk premiums, and had been disproportionate to the changes in corporate earnings. In the United States, share prices were now only 4 per cent below the peak of 2018. In Australia, on an accumulation basis (which takes account of dividend payments) share price indices were back to around their 2018 peak. Chinese share prices had risen particularly strongly since the start of 2019 – most likely reflecting optimism around US–China trade negotiations and recent and expected future policy easing – but had underperformed relative to other markets over the preceding year. ", " Forecasts for corporate earnings in 2019 in the major markets, as well as in Australia, had been lowered in recent months, consistent with the downward revisions to the outlook for growth and inflation in several economies. Nevertheless, some growth in earnings was still expected in Australia and abroad. Underlying profits for listed companies in Australia had been little changed in the second half of 2018. Profits in parts of the resources sector had been supported by higher commodity prices, while profits in sectors exposed to property had tended to decline. ", " Members noted that the easing in global financial conditions had also been evident in corporate bond spreads, which had declined recently, and that corporate bond yields had remained close to historically low levels. ", " In China, growth in total social financing had increased a little in recent months, after declining steadily over the preceding year. The slowing in growth in total social financing since late 2017 had reflected policy measures to reduce non-bank lending activity, which had been an important source of funding for private firms, in order to reduce overall risks in the financial system. More recently, the pace of contraction in non-bank lending had abated somewhat, as the authorities wanted to ensure financing was readily available for smaller private firms. Growth in corporate bond issuance had also picked up over the preceding year. Members noted that the Chinese authorities were continuing to balance their priorities of supporting growth while addressing financial stability risks. ", " Financial conditions in other emerging markets had continued to ease, after tightening over 2018. Equity prices had unwound some of their earlier falls and the increase in bond spreads had also been partly retraced. Exchange rates of emerging market economies had stabilised, and appreciated in some cases, and inflows of foreign capital had resumed. Policy adjustments in some economies, as well as the easing in global financial conditions and associated depreciation in the US dollar, had contributed to the easing in financial conditions in emerging markets. ", " In foreign exchange markets, members noted that the Chinese renminbi had appreciated slightly since late 2018. The Australian dollar had been broadly steady over preceding months and remained within the relatively narrow range of recent years. ", " Turning to domestic financial markets, members noted that growth in housing lending to owner-occupiers had slowed to 5 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms, while growth in lending to investors in housing had stabilised at a rate of around 1 per cent. Housing loan approvals data indicated that the slowing in housing lending growth had been largely accounted for by the major banks, but members noted that, more recently, loan approvals by other smaller lenders had also declined. ", " Liaison with banks and other lenders suggested that the requirements for more thorough verification of income and expenditure data had led to an increase in loan approval times in 2018, but subsequent investments in people and technology had reduced approval times. The typical time from application to approval was reported to be currently around one week. It was reported that approval times for loans for house and land packages remained significantly longer (closer to around one month) than for loans for established property, because of careful management of the greater risks involved in this form of lending. Overall, liaison with lenders suggested that loan approval rates were little changed and that reduced demand from borrowers, particularly investors, largely explained the slower growth in lending. ", " Nevertheless, members noted that there had been some reduction in the supply of credit as lending practices had been tightened over the previous year. Members discussed a number of additional factors that could influence credit supply in 2019, including: the Melbourne Institute's household expenditure measure, which plays some role in lending assessments, had increased by more than it had in recent years; tighter lending policies on debt-to-income ratios; and the broadening of comprehensive credit reporting, which might reveal under-reporting of applicants' other liabilities. While these factors could affect the maximum amount offered to a borrower, only a small proportion of borrowers borrow up to their limits. ", " Members noted that banks continued to compete for borrowers of high credit quality by offering lower interest rates on new loans than those offered on existing loans. ", " Growth in business credit had remained robust, with both the major banks and other lenders having contributed to the growth over the preceding year, although the major banks account for a smaller share of business lending than before the onset of the global financial crisis. Members observed, however, that the growth in business lending had been entirely to large businesses, with one estimate suggesting that lending to small businesses had declined slightly over the preceding year. There had been greater caution around lending to small businesses in response to the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. Lower housing prices had also reduced the value of collateral for loans to small businesses. ", " Members noted that interest rates in the Australian short-term money market had recently declined from the persistently high levels around the turn of the year, in line with developments in international markets, although they remained a little above their levels of earlier years. Members had a detailed discussion of the Bank's operations in repurchase and foreign exchange swap markets and their role in achieving the Board's target for the cash rate. Banks' longer-term funding costs had declined a little over recent months, consistent with lower long-term government bond yields, even though spreads on bank bonds had increased over the preceding year. Overall, the marginal cost of banks' wholesale funding had declined a little from 2018 levels, to be only slightly higher than in 2017. At the same time, the major banks' retail deposit rates had continued to drift down. ", " Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged during 2019, but that a reduction in the cash rate was expected by early 2020. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that growth in the global economy had been above trend in 2018, although it had slowed over the second half of the year and timely indicators suggested that this moderation had extended into 2019. Nonetheless, output growth had remained sufficient in most advanced economies for labour markets to remain tight, putting upward pressure on wages. Members noted the tension in a number of economies between slower GDP growth and resilient labour markets. The transmission of tighter labour market conditions to inflation pressures was taking longer than might be expected, based on historical experience. ", " The authorities had responded to slowing growth in China by putting in place policies to increase the flow of credit to the private sector and easing fiscal policy in a targeted way to support growth, while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector. Slowing growth in China and ongoing trade tensions had led to lower growth in global trade, and continued to be a source of uncertainty for the outlook for global growth. ", " The tightening of global financial conditions, associated with higher risk premiums required by investors around the turn of the year, had eased. Members assessed that global financial conditions remained accommodative, with financial market pricing indicating that little change to the accommodative stance of monetary policy in the advanced economies was expected over the following year or so. The terms of trade for Australia were expected to have remained above their trough in early 2016 and the Australian dollar had remained within its narrow range of recent times. ", " Domestically, there continued to be tension between the ongoing improvement in labour market data and the apparent slowing in the momentum of output growth in the second half of 2018. Leading indicators of conditions in the labour market, such as vacancies and hiring intentions, pointed to further tightening in the labour market in the near term. Private sector wages growth had picked up further in the December quarter, consistent with the Bank's forecasts and survey evidence that a significant share of firms were finding it difficult to attract suitable labour. ", " Although output growth had slowed in the second half of 2018, the outlook for business investment and spending on public infrastructure had remained positive. Growth in consumption was expected to be supported by an increase in growth in household disposable income. However, there continued to be considerable uncertainty around the outlook for consumption given the environment of declining housing prices in some cities, low growth in household income and high debt levels. Dwelling investment was expected to subtract from growth in output over the forecast period and, unless pre-sales volumes started to increase, this decline could be sharper than currently expected. ", " The process of adjustment in the housing market had continued. Housing prices in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth had declined further, and turnover in the housing market had fallen significantly. Rent inflation had remained low across most of the country despite declines in rental vacancy rates over the previous year, except in Sydney, where rental vacancy rates had been increasing. Credit conditions had tightened for some borrowers and the demand for housing credit had slowed noticeably as conditions in the housing market had changed. Mortgage rates had remained low and there was strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality. ", " Members noted that the sustained low level of interest rates over recent years had been supporting economic activity and had allowed for gradual progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. While the labour market had continued to strengthen, less progress had been made on inflation. Looking forward, the central forecast scenario was still for growth in GDP of around 3 per cent over 2019 and a further decline in the unemployment rate to 4¾ per cent over the next couple of years. This further reduction in spare capacity underpinned the forecast of a gradual pick-up in wage pressures and inflation. Given this, members agreed that developments in the labour market were particularly important. ", " Taking account of the available information on current economic and financial conditions and how they were expected to evolve, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy was supporting jobs growth and a gradual lift in inflation. However, members noted that significant uncertainties around the forecasts remained, with scenarios where an increase in the cash rate would be appropriate at some point and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would be appropriate. The probabilities around these scenarios were more evenly balanced than they had been over the preceding year. ", " Members agreed to continue to assess the outlook carefully. Given that further progress in reducing unemployment and lifting inflation was a reasonable expectation, members agreed that there was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, they assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady while new information became available that could help resolve the current tensions in the domestic economic data. Members judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would enable the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence, and would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Underlying inflation had remained close to target in a number ofadvanced economies, but global headline inflation had declined since late 2018 because of the fall inoil prices.", "Growth in consumption in the advanced economies had been supported by ongoing tightness in labourmarkets, which had led to an upward trend in wages growth over a number of years. In the United States,the unemployment rate had remained below levels consistent with full employment and employers had beenfinding it increasingly difficult to find suitable labour. Members observed that most sectors of the USlabour market had experienced strong conditions and the pick-up in wages growth had been most pronouncedfor lower-income workers.", "In Japan, consumption was expected to be supported by a bring-forward of spending ahead of an increasein the consumption tax in October 2019, as well as ongoing tightness in the labour market. In the euroarea, the unemployment rate had been declining gradually and wage pressures had increased. However,employment intentions had eased in the euro area and, more sharply, in the United Kingdom in the contextof ongoing uncertainty around Britain's exit from the European Union.", "The outlook for investment across the major advanced economies had been more mixed. In the UnitedStates, investment indicators had eased a little but remained above average, while investment in theeuro area had weakened further. Members noted that political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and theeuro area was weighing on investment in those economies. In Japan, survey measures suggested thatbusiness conditions would remain strong despite a prospective moderation in investment growth.", "In China, growth in domestic demand had slowed. At its March meeting, the National People'sCongress had set a target of 6–6.5 per cent for growth in output in 2019, which wasbelow the target of around 6.5 per cent in 2018. Members noted signs that stimulus measuresimplemented by the authorities over recent months were having an impact: growth in total socialfinancing had increased a little, after slowing over the preceding year, and growth in infrastructureinvestment and retail spending had recovered. Residential construction activity had also increased.However, some recent indicators of production and investment in the manufacturing sector, which is moreexposed to external demand, had been subdued.

GDP had increased by 0.2 per cent inthe December quarter and by 2.3 per cent over the year, which was below the forecastspresented in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. The soft December quarter outcomepartly reflected another weak quarter of consumption growth and a larger-than-expected fall in dwellinginvestment. It also reflected some temporary factors, such as the weather-related disruption to resourceexports and the effect of the drought. Public demand and non-mining investment had supported outputgrowth. Members noted that the income-based measure of GDP growth had been particularly weak over thepreceding year, while the expenditure-based measure had been stronger.", "Growth in consumption had clearly slowed in the second half of 2018. The weakness had been concentratedin discretionary items, especially those that have historically been most correlated with housing pricesand housing turnover, such as motor vehicles and home furnishings. Retail sales data and contacts in theBank's liaison program suggested that growth in housing-related consumption had remained soft inrecent months.", "Members noted that growth in household disposable income, which is an important driver of consumptiongrowth, had been subdued for a number of years. In 2018, labour income growth had been above the verylow rates seen in recent years, supported by a pick-up in growth in average hourly earnings andcontinued employment growth, but non-labour income growth had remained weak. Members observed that taxpayments by households had been growing noticeably faster than income growth in recent years, partlybecause of efforts to increase tax compliance.", "Dwelling investment appeared to have passed its peak, although there continued to be uncertainty abouthow quickly dwelling investment might decline over the forecast period. Construction of new dwellingshad contracted in the second half of 2018; the largest falls in the December quarter had been forapartments in New South Wales and detached housing in Queensland. Slower housing activity had alsoweighed on the incomes of some building contractors and property professionals in the December quarter.There continued to be a large amount of work in the pipeline, which should support a relatively highlevel of building activity in the near term. Members noted that there had been a substantial rise inbuilding approvals for high-density residential projects in February, although this series was volatileand in trend terms remained well below earlier peaks. Members also noted that population growth wasexpected to continue to support demand for housing over the medium term.", "Conditions in the established housing market had remained weak in recent months. Housing prices hadcontinued to fall in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, and had declined a little in most other capital citiesand regional areas. In March, Sydney prices were 13 per cent below their 2017 peak andMelbourne prices were 10 per cent below their peak. Although auction clearance rates in Sydneyand Melbourne had increased over the first quarter of 2019, they remained at relatively low levels.Members noted that in Perth, housing prices had declined over the previous year, while the rentalvacancy rate had declined sharply and there were signs that newly advertised rents were starting toincrease. By contrast, rental vacancies in Sydney had risen, particularly in suburbs where the supply ofnew apartments had increased significantly.", "Non-mining business investment had grown solidly in the December quarter, with non-residentialconstruction having made the largest contribution to growth in the quarter, driven partly by stronggrowth in private sector infrastructure projects, such as roads and renewable energy. Forward-lookingindicators, such as the substantial amount of work still to be done on private infrastructure projects,the relatively high level of non-residential building approvals and positive business investmentintentions, pointed to further growth in non-mining business investment. Survey measures of businessconditions had declined in late 2018, but had stabilised at above-average levels.", "Mining activity had subtracted from growth in the second half of 2018, mainly reflecting ongoingdeclines in mining investment as remaining LNG projects approached completion. Members noted thatinvestment required to sustain capacity and recently announced expansion projects were expected tosupport stronger mining investment over the medium term. Declines in resource exports, partly related tosupply disruptions, had also subtracted from growth in the second half of 2018. Coal exports to Chinahad declined by 20 per cent, partly as a result of weather-related disruptions. The longertime taken for imports of coal to clear Chinese customs in recent months was also likely to have playeda role.

Non-financial firms had increased their bond issuance in 2019, particularly inthe US dollar high-yield sector. By contrast, issuance of leveraged loans had been more subdued, whichpartly reflected an easing in investors' appetites for floating rate securities in response tothe lowering of policy rate expectations. Equity markets in the advanced economies had been littlechanged in March, having previously rebounded from their sharp fall in late 2018.", "In China, equity markets had risen particularly sharply since the end of 2018, which was likely to havereflected some easing in US–China trade tensions, as well as the authorities' stimulusmeasures. Growth in total social financing had increased a little in recent months, as the authoritieshad taken measures to encourage bond issuance. They had also encouraged banks to provide finance tosmaller private firms. To support this, the authorities had signalled additional targeted monetaryeasing for the period ahead. These changes had followed a slowing in the growth of total socialfinancing over the preceding year or more as the authorities had taken measures to reduce non-banklending, which had been an important source of funding for private firms, in order to reduce overallrisks in the financial system.", "In other emerging markets, conditions had been relatively stable in 2019, although Argentina and Turkeyhad experienced renewed depreciation of their exchange rates in response to continued macro-financialand political risks in those economies.", "Members noted that there had been little change in major economies' foreign exchange marketsover the preceding month. The Australian dollar had also been little changed, remaining at the lower endof its range of recent years. The strength in commodity prices and the terms of trade had beensupporting the exchange rate, while the continued decline in Australian government bond yields relativeto those in other major markets had been working in the opposite direction.", "Growth in housing lending to owner-occupiers had slowed to 4¾ per cent insix-month-ended annualised terms, although the monthly growth rate had increased slightly in February.Growth in housing lending to investors remained at a very low level. Housing loan approvals werematerially below the levels of a year earlier, but had also increased slightly in February, with thesmall uptick in approvals broadly based across types of borrowers. Members observed that the slowing inhousing lending over the preceding year had been driven largely by weakness in demand, particularly frominvestors. There had also been some tightening in lending practices. Lenders continued to compete forborrowers of high credit quality by offering lower interest rates on new loans than typically paid onexisting loans.", "Members noted that the major banks' funding costs had declined over the preceding couple ofmonths. The cost of debt funding had declined as pressures had eased in short-term money markets andbank bond spreads had narrowed. Deposit rates had also continued to edge downwards.", "Funding conditions for Australian businesses more broadly were accommodative. Three-year bond yieldsfor corporations across all major sectors had declined to record lows, reflecting the decline in bothgovernment bond yields and spreads. Bond issuance by non-financial corporations in the first quarter of2019 had been in line with that of recent years. Growth in bank lending to businesses had remainedrobust, in part reflecting increased lending by the major banks, although other institutions hadaccounted for most of the growth. Members observed that the growth in business lending had been entirelyto large businesses. Meanwhile, credit conditions for some small businesses were reported to havetightened further recently.", "Financial market participants' expectations of a rate cut had been brought forward followingweaker than expected data, most notably the December quarter national accounts. Financial market pricingimplied that the cash rate was expected to be lowered in the second half of 2019 and then again in2020."], "Financial Stability": ["Members were briefed on the Bank's regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system.Overall, members noted that financial stability risks were slightly higher than six months earlier butwere not especially elevated.", "Globally, investors were receiving little compensation for taking on risk. Notably, risk-free rateswere very low and the term premium in the United States had briefly turned negative. Furthermore,corporate bond spreads remained low. These conditions had contributed to the significant increase inborrowing by businesses since the global financial crisis. However, members noted that debt servicingcosts had not increased to the same extent, given the decline in interest rates over this period. Thehigh prices of a range of assets in this environment meant that there was heightened risk of an abruptrepricing in response to news.", "Members observed that the profitability of banks globally had generally increased. In part, thisreflected above-trend economic growth in the first half of 2018. However, some European banks remainedfragile, given large stocks of non-performing loans, high cost structures and overcapacity. The largestock of sovereign debt held by some European banks, along with concerns about sovereign debtsustainability, raised potential issues about the resilience of some banking systems.", "In China, the authorities had taken measures to contain risks in the financial system. As a result, thepace of growth in debt had slowed to below the pace of growth in the economy. However, given the earlierrapid growth in debt, China's ratio of non-financial debt to GDP remained higher than in othereconomies with comparable income and even higher than in many high-income economies. Members noted thatthe earlier rapid growth in debt had also raised concerns about the lending standards under which thoseloans had been made.", "In Australia, conditions in the housing market had remained weak. Housing prices had fallen further inthe capital cities and regional areas. Over the preceding six months, the falls had been largest inSydney and Melbourne, but prices in these cities had remained more than 40 per cent higherthan in 2012. Falls in housing prices had resulted in some borrowers having negative equity, where thevalue of their loans exceeded that of their properties. Nationally, just over 2 per cent ofborrowers, accounting for less than 3 per cent of housing debt, were estimated to havenegative equity. Around 90 per cent of these borrowers were in Queensland, Western Australiaand the Northern Territory. Members observed that negative equity by itself was not a concern forfinancial stability. However, if unemployment were to rise and borrowers were not able to continue tomake repayments, then financial institutions would incur increased losses. Members noted that thedecline in high loan-to-valuation ratio (LVR) lending in recent years was expected to lessen any lossesfor lenders. In recent quarters, almost all loans to investors had LVRs less than 90 per cent.By contrast, a decade earlier only 85 per cent of loans to investors had LVRs less than90 per cent. The share of owner-occupiers with high LVR loans had also declined.", "Members noted that total household payments on housing debt as a share of income had been broadlystable in recent years. Within the total, however, an increase in scheduled principal repayments hadroughly offset a fall in unscheduled principal repayments. Members noted that households' excesspayments amounted to about two-and-a-half years' worth of scheduled repayments on average.Housing loan interest payments had increased slightly as housing debt had increased.", "Banks' assets had continued to perform well overall. Although banks' non-performinghousing loans had increased, they remained low at less than 1 per cent of their total housinglending. Members noted that the increase in housing loan arrears had been driven by loans remaining inarrears for longer, on average. Banks' business loans had been performing well, withnon-performing loan rates around their lowest levels in a decade. Banks had continued to accumulatecapital, with the capital ratios of the four major banks all exceeding or close to the‘unquestionably strong’ benchmarks set out by the Australian Prudential RegulationAuthority (APRA).", "The tightening in banks' housing lending practices over recent years had been accompanied by anincrease in lending by non-banks, although this was still estimated to account for less than5 per cent of total housing credit. Members noted that, while not subject to prudentialregulation by APRA, non-banks' housing lending is subject to responsible lending obligations. Theavailable evidence suggested that the riskiness of non-bank housing lending had not increased.", "Members noted that the International Monetary Fund's Financial Sector Assessment Program reporton the Australian financial system was generally positive about the resilience of domestic financialinstitutions and the quality of regulatory and supervisory oversight, but made several high-levelrecommendations for improving current arrangements."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that growth in the global economy hadslowed over the second half of 2018 and into 2019. Trade tensions and political developments in Europeremained sources of uncertainty. At the same time, though, global financial conditions had eased inpreceding months and, in China, the authorities had provided targeted stimulus to support domesticgrowth. In a number of economies, continued strength in labour market data and moderating GDP growthwere sending different signals about the momentum in economic activity. Members noted that this was alsothe case in Australia. While the labour market had continued to improve in early 2019, GDP growth hadslowed over 2018. Continued low growth in household disposable income and the adjustment in housingmarkets had weighed on household spending.", "Members noted that the sustained low level of interest rates over recent years had been supportingeconomic activity and had contributed to progress in reducing the unemployment rate and returninginflation towards the midpoint of the target, albeit only gradually. The central scenario was forfurther gradual progress to be made on both unemployment and inflation. Members observed that a pick-upin growth in household disposable income was an important element of these forecasts. Given this outlookfor further progress towards the Bank's goals, members agreed that there was not a strong casefor a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Members recognised that it was not possible to fine-tuneoutcomes and that holding monetary policy steady would enable the Bank to be a source of stability andconfidence.", "Members agreed that inflation was likely to remain low for some time. Wages growth had remained low,there continued to be strong competition in the retail sector and governments had been working to easecost of living pressures, including through their influence on administered prices. In thesecircumstances, members agreed that the likelihood of a scenario where the cash rate would need to beincreased in the near term was low.", "Members also discussed the scenario where inflation did not move any higher and unemployment trendedup, noting that a decrease in the cash rate would likely be appropriate in these circumstances. Theyrecognised that the effect on the economy of lower interest rates could be expected to be smaller thanin the past, given the high level of household debt and the adjustment that was occurring in housingmarkets. Nevertheless, a lower level of interest rates could still be expected to support the economythrough a depreciation of the exchange rate and by reducing required interest payments on borrowing,freeing up cash for other expenditure.", "Taking account of the further progress expected towards the Bank's goals, members assessed thatit was appropriate to hold the cash rate steady. Looking forward, the Board will continue to monitordevelopments, including how the current tensions between the domestic GDP and labour market data evolve,and set monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and achieve the inflation targetover time."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent."]}},

Global trade and manufacturing activity had slowed over the preceding year. Tradetensions had remained elevated, although no new measures had been introduced since the previousmeeting.", "In China, recent indicators of economic activity suggested that growth had slowed since the Marchquarter. Growth in industrial production had fallen following a strong reading in March and the level offixed asset investment had declined. Conditions in the Chinese property market had also softened andunderlying demand conditions were expected to moderate over time, given the ageing of the population anda slowing in the rate of urbanisation. Over the preceding month, the Chinese authorities had introducedadditional measures to support growth, including more favourable financing conditions for localgovernments investing in infrastructure projects.", "In east Asia, the combination of weaker Chinese growth, the downturn in global semiconductor demand andthe trade and technology disputes had weighed on trade, although new export orders suggested thatconditions might be stabilising. The effect of the US–China trade dispute had not been evenacross the region. Some economies, such as Thailand and Vietnam, had seen strong growth in their exportsto the United States, which reflected some diversion of trade that had previously been between theUnited States and China.", "Growth in output in the United States had continued to be supported by strong growth in consumption,while growth in investment appeared to have slowed further. Members noted that capital goods orders hadslowed and that the stimulus to investment from tax cuts had largely run its course. Growth in domesticdemand in the euro area had been relatively resilient in the March quarter, but more recent data hadbeen mixed. Growth in Japanese domestic demand had slowed in early 2019, partly as a result ofspillovers from weak external demand conditions, but growth was likely to be supported in the near termby a pick-up in consumption growth in the lead-up to an increase in the consumption tax in October2019.", "Labour markets remained tight in the major advanced economies. Members noted that participation ratesfor people aged between 15 and 64 years had increased significantly in recent years and unemploymentrates were at historically low levels. This suggested that there was relatively little spare capacity inthese labour markets. Members noted that participation rates of people aged 65 years and over had alsobeen increasing. Wages growth had picked up, but this had not yet been translated into strongerinflationary pressures and inflation remained below target in most advanced economies. Althoughinflation had been around target in the United States, some measures suggested US inflation had shiftedlower more recently. The decline in oil prices, by around 15 per cent since their peak in midMay, would weigh on headline inflation globally in the near term.", "Iron ore prices had increased by more than 25 per cent since the previous meeting and hadmore than doubled over the previous year. Chinese steel production had continued to grow strongly inrecent months, despite slowing industrial activity in China. At the same time, there was limited sparecapacity in the seaborne market to increase supply and inventories of iron ore at Chinese ports had beendeclining. Rising iron ore prices had underpinned a 3 per cent increase in the Australianterms of trade in the March quarter."], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members noted that the main domestic economic news over the previous month had been the release of thenational accounts for the March quarter and updates on the labour and housing markets.", "The national accounts reported that the domestic economy had grown by 0.4 per cent in theMarch quarter. Public demand had continued to support growth in the quarter, with public consumptionboosted by the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and increased spending on thePharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Growth in public sector investment had been positive despite a declinein defence spending. Members noted that there was a strong pipeline of public infrastructure projectsthat could support activity for some time.", "Private demand had contracted for the third consecutive quarter because there had been further falls inmining investment and housing construction. Consumption growth had remained subdued.", "Growth in business investment had been weaker than expected in the March quarter. This was partlybecause it had taken longer than expected for liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects to reach finalcompletion. However, investment in automation and other productive efficiencies had supported machinery&amp; equipment investment in the mining sector. Non-mining business investment had continued to expandin the March quarter, supported by a further increase in non-residential construction, while non-miningmachinery &amp; equipment investment had fallen. Members observed that there had been some differencesin the findings of surveys of business conditions. In the main, surveyed measures of business conditionshad declined to around or a little above average levels. However, both the retail and transportationsectors had experienced well below-average conditions.", "Exports had increased in the March quarter, primarily driven by growth in rural and service exports.The boost to meat exports in the quarter as a result of ongoing drought conditions leading to destockinghad been larger than the subtraction from lower crop exports. Resource exports (excluding non-monetarygold) had fallen in the March quarter because of temporary supply disruptions. More recent data on tradeand shipments suggested that iron ore and LNG exports had increased since the March quarter, while coalexports appeared to have fallen. Higher iron ore prices had supported overall export values and thetrade surplus had increased to almost 3 per cent of GDP in the March quarter. The tradesurplus was at its highest level, and the current account deficit at its lowest level, measured as ashare of GDP, since the 1970s.", "Consumption had grown by 1.8 per cent over the year to the March quarter, which was wellbelow average. Members noted that, in per capita terms, consumption had been broadly flat. Growth inhousehold spending on essential items had been relatively steady, while the level of spending ondiscretionary items had fallen in the March quarter. This weakness had been broadly based across thestates and recent retail trade data suggested that discretionary spending had remained soft in the Junequarter.", "Members had a detailed discussion of the effects on price inflation in the retail trade sector ofincreased competition from foreign entrants and online retailers over the preceding decade or so.Members noted that the increase in the supply of retail items and lower retail prices in response toincreased competition were positive developments for consumers, other things equal. Many retailers andwholesalers had also become more efficient in response to more intense competition, often using newtechnology (including in logistics), which had resulted in relatively rapid multifactor productivitygrowth in these sectors. Members noted that the adjustment in the retail sector had been protracted andhad put downward pressure on inflation for some years. In the more recent period, the effects on pricesof greater competition had been difficult to separate from the effects of the prevailing weak demandconditions.", "Growth in household disposable income had increased in recent quarters, supported by growth in labourincome, but had remained low in year-ended terms. Members noted that growth in labour income had beendriven by strong employment growth and that growth in hourly earnings had remained subdued. New privatesector enterprise bargaining agreements had incorporated slightly faster wages growth than agreementsreached a year earlier. However, wages growth for workers on existing enterprise bargaining agreementshad remained subdued, and there was little prospect of a near-term pick-up in public sector outcomesgiven the ongoing wage caps.", "A small decline in growth in tax payments had also contributed to growth in household disposable incomein the March quarter. By contrast, the income of unincorporated enterprises had remained weak, partlybecause of drought-related falls in farm incomes and the downturn in housing construction. Members notedthat this weakness was likely to continue in the near term.", "Dwelling investment had declined in the March quarter. Further falls were expected given the sharpdecline in building approvals over the preceding year and a half. While the pipeline of constructionwork yet to be done in New South Wales and Victoria remained high, liaison contacts expected housingconstruction could drop off more sharply because pre-sales activity had been so weak.", "Conditions in the established housing markets of Sydney and Melbourne had improved a little since theprevious meeting. Housing prices had stabilised in June in these cities and auction clearance rates hadpicked up further, albeit still on low volumes. More generally, turnover in the housing market hadremained low. Housing prices had continued to fall in Perth and Darwin.", "Employment growth had remained strong, at 2.9 per cent over the year to May. Despite this,there was still spare capacity in the labour market. Some of the additional labour demand had been metby an increase in the participation rate, which had reached its highest level on record. Even so,forward-looking indicators, such as job advertisements and employment intentions, suggested that growthin employment would moderate over coming months. The unemployment rate had remained at5.2 per cent in May and the underemployment rate had remained elevated.", "In view of the fact the meeting was held in Darwin, members had a thorough discussion of economicconditions and future economic opportunities in the Northern Territory. They noted that the NorthernTerritory economy had experienced a significant cycle related to the construction and then completion ofthe INPEX LNG plant. The downturn in the mining cycle had had significant spillovers to other parts ofthe Northern Territory economy because, aside from the public sector, mining and construction are thelargest industries in terms of gross value added. Employment had fallen in the Northern Territory over2019 and this had been accompanied by large flows of people moving to other parts of the country. As aresult, the unemployment rate for the Northern Territory had increased, but it remained lower than thenational average. More generally, the Northern Territory had a relatively young population and highlabour market participation rates. The decline in the Northern Territory population had also led to asignificant decline in dwelling investment in the Northern Territory over recent years.", "Members observed that the broad statistics on the labour market for the Northern Territory masked therelative disadvantage of the Indigenous population. The unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians onaverage was relatively high, and Indigenous Australians were less likely to complete school and morelikely to experience poor health. These measures of Indigenous disadvantage were particularly acute inremote locations, where it is more difficult to deliver services.", "Members noted that there were a number of opportunities for economic growth in the Northern Territoryin the future, including tourism, agricultural exports (including live beef exports), the defenceindustry and mining. Higher mining investment in the Northern Territory in the future could come fromsome small-scale mining projects that had not yet reached final investment decision and the possibilityof some onshore unconventional gas projects."], "Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting the significant change in theexpected path of monetary policy around the world, particularly in the United States. This change hadreflected a combination of weaker-than-expected economic activity and inflation over recent months, aswell as the downside risks from the trade and technology disputes between the United States andChina.", "Monetary policy in the United States had been unchanged in June, but the Federal Reserve had indicatedthat it was prepared to act to sustain the economic expansion. Members of the Federal Open MarketCommittee (FOMC) saw a stronger case to reduce the federal funds rate during 2019, in contrast with theearlier ‘patient’ stance as the FOMC had awaited further data. Market pricing had moved toimply an expectation that the federal funds rate would decline by 100 basis points over thefollowing year, compared with 50 basis points a month earlier.", "In other major economies, the European Central Bank had indicated that it was prepared to add moremonetary stimulus if the outlook for growth and inflation did not improve, including by expanding itsbond-buying program. The Bank of Japan had intimated that it would allow bond yields to move below thelower end of its ‘yield curve control’ target and reiterated that there was scope to easemonetary policy further if needed. And in China, market participants expected the People's Bankof China to ease monetary policy further in the period ahead.", "As expectations for monetary policy easing had firmed over the course of this year, governmentbond yields had declined further in major markets, to a record low in Germany and further into negativeterritory in Japan. In the United States, lower bond yields reflected lower expected real policy ratesfor an extended period, as well as persistently low inflation and term premia. Yields on 10-yearAustralian government bonds had reached a historical low of 1.3 per cent, with yieldsremaining around 70 basis points below US treasury bond yields of similar maturity. Compensationfor risk on corporate bonds globally remained compressed, as market participants judged that policyeasing would support growth in economic activity and profits. Members noted that, as a result, the costof funds for corporations remained low, including in Australia.", "Equity prices had increased inmajor markets over the preceding month, to a record high level in the United States, despite prominentdownside risks. Higher equity prices owed primarily to a lowering of discount rates, reflecting theexpected easing of monetary policies, whereas the outlook for corporate earnings had been littlechanged. Recent movements in equity prices in Australia had broadly followed international trends, withincreases in equity prices in all main sectors over the preceding month. Members noted thatanalysts' forecasts of earnings of Australian non-resource companies had declined over the courseof the past year, consistent with broader surveys of business conditions.", "Members noted thatbank liquidity conditions in China had remained accommodative overall. However, the solvency andliquidity of small banks (which account for one-quarter of banking assets) had been attracting morescrutiny from both investors and the authorities after a period of rapid asset growth, amid widerfinancial stability concerns.", "In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had remainedaround multi-year highs on a trade-weighted basis, although it had depreciated somewhat in the weeksleading up to the meeting as US bond yields had declined relative to those in other major economies. Theeuro had remained within the relatively narrow range of the preceding few years on a trade-weightedbasis, while the yen had broadly appreciated over recent months. The Australian dollar had been largelyunchanged following the decision to lower the cash rate in June. Nevertheless, having depreciated byabout 3 per cent in TWI terms since late 2018, the Australian dollar was around its lows ofrecent years, with the effect of the decline in Australian bond yields relative to other major marketsover that period partly offset by the unexpected strength in commodity prices.", "In Australia,monthly housing credit growth had remained broadly stable in recent months, particularly for lending forowner-occupation. Aggregate housing credit had been growing at an annualised rate of around3 per cent, with much of the decline in the rate of growth over the preceding year driven byweaker demand for finance associated with the correction in the housing market. Loan approvals by bothowner-occupiers and investors had continued to decline in May. However, an easing in the loanserviceability interest-rate floor was likely to see a boost in borrowing capacity for many newborrowers, which would be in addition to the positive effect on the cash flow of the household sectoroverall following the reduction in the cash rate at the previous meeting.", "The three-month bankbill swap rate (BBSW) had declined further over the preceding month. Accordingly, the increase in thespreads of BBSW and other short-term money market rates to the overnight indexed swap rate in 2018 hadbeen fully unwound. Wholesale funding costs (which affect two-thirds of banks' debt funding) hadalso declined in line with the cash rate. As a result, the major banks' debt funding costs hadreached a historic low.", "Members noted that the favourable financing conditions for non-financialcorporations had supported corporate bond issuance. Although business credit growth had declined overrecent months, growth in total business debt had remained little changed. Meanwhile, yields onresidential mortgage-backed securities had also been at low levels and issuance by non-banks in thismarket had increased significantly in the June quarter, to levels not seen since prior to the globalfinancial crisis.", "Members noted that most lenders had passed on the 25 basis pointsreduction in the cash rate in June to mortgage rates. Business borrowing rates had declined in line withthe decline in BBSW. Members also noted that the reduction in the cash rate had been passed through tomany retail deposit rates, although some of these rates were already very low.", "Market pricingimplied that further monetary policy easing was expected following recent data and the Bank'scommunication since the previous meeting. A 25 basis points reduction in the cash rate had beenfully priced in by August 2019, with a further easing expected by the end of the year."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["Members observed that the outlook for the global economy remained reasonable, although the risks fromthe international trade and technology disputes remained high. Growth in trade had remained weak andthere had been further signs that heightened uncertainty was affecting investment decisions. Despitetight labour markets and rising wages growth, inflation had generally remained low in the advancedeconomies. Both the trade-related downside risks to global growth and ongoing subdued inflation hadspurred an increased expectation that major central banks would ease monetary policy. This hadreinforced already very accommodative conditions in global financial markets.", "In considering the policy decision, members discussed the recent data on output and the labour market.On the former, GDP growth had been well below trend over the year to the March quarter. Despite stronggrowth in employment, growth in household disposable income had remained low and this had contributed tolow growth in consumption. Members noted the near-term prospects for a lift in income growth and thecontribution of the low and middle income tax offset. Higher growth in disposable income was expected tosupport consumption, although the outlook for consumption remained uncertain. Accommodative monetarypolicy, strong public demand, a renewed expansion in the resources sector and growth in exports werealso expected to support a return of GDP growth to trend over coming years.", "Members observed that employment growth continued to outpace growth in the working-age population.However, most of the strength in labour demand over preceding months had been met by an increase inparticipation, which had risen to a record high level, rather than a decline in the unemployment rate.Although there had been a modest pick-up in wages growth in the private sector, wages growth hadremained low overall. In combination, these factors suggested that spare capacity was likely to remainin the labour market for some time.", "Declining housing prices had also contributed to low growth in consumption, although there were signsthat conditions in some housing markets, notably in Sydney and Melbourne, had stabilised. Members notedthat mortgage rates were at record lows and that there was strong competition for borrowers of highcredit quality. However, demand for credit by investors continued to be subdued and credit conditionsfor small and medium-sized businesses remained tight.", "In assessing the outlook for inflation, members agreed that further improvements in the labour marketwould be required for wages growth to increase materially. As assessed at the previous meeting, membersagreed that the Australian economy could sustain a lower rate of unemployment, while achieving inflationconsistent with the target. In light of this, the recent run of data and the lower level of interestrates resulting from the decision taken at the previous meeting, the case for a further reduction in thecash rate was considered.", "Members recognised that, in the current environment, the main channels through which lower interestrates would support the economy were a lower value of the exchange rate than otherwise would be the caseand lower required interest payments on borrowing, which would free up cash for other expenditure byhouseholds and businesses.", "Members judged that a further reduction in the level of interest rates would support the necessarygrowth in employment and incomes, and promote stronger overall economic conditions, which would in turnsupport a gradual increase in underlying inflation. Members also judged that the extent of sparecapacity in the economy, and the likely pace at which it would be absorbed, meant that a decline ininterest rates was unlikely to encourage an unwelcome material pick-up in borrowing by households thatwould add to medium-term risks in the economy. Members recognised the uneven effect of lower interestrates on different households.", "Taking into account all the available information, the Board decided that it was appropriate to lowerthe cash rate by 25 basis points. This decision, together with the reduction in the cash ratedecided at the previous meeting, would assist in reducing spare capacity in the economy and makingfaster progress in reducing the unemployment rate. Lower interest rates would provide more Australianswith jobs and assist with achieving more assured progress towards the inflation target. The Board wouldcontinue to monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy if needed tosupport sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1.00 per cent."]}},

Members noted that recent and prospective increases in tariffs couldincrease consumer price inflation in the United States by between ¼ and ½ percentagepoint over the following few years, based on a range of published estimates. In response to the USannouncements, China had suspended purchases of US agricultural products and had announced plans toincrease tariffs on around one-half of the value of US imports. In value terms, US exports to Chinahad contracted by around 20 per cent over the year to June, while US imports from Chinahad been around 3 per cent lower. Members also noted that some other east Asian economies werebenefiting from the diversion of US imports away from China.", "More generally, global trade volumes had fallen over the previous year, reflecting both the escalationof trade tensions and slower growth in Chinese domestic demand.

Recent indicators suggested trade-related activity would remain weak for sometime.", "Members noted that weak external demand and heightened geopolitical uncertainty had contributed tolower growth in business investment in many economies, including the United States, the euro area andthe United Kingdom. These economies had also recorded declines in investment intentions. By contrast, inthe United States the household sector had been resilient, but overall GDP growth had slowed in the Junequarter. GDP growth had also slowed in most euro area countries in the June quarter; Germany hadrecorded a small contraction in GDP. By contrast, GDP growth in Japan had been moderate, supported byconsumption brought forward ahead of a scheduled increase in the consumption tax in October, as well asongoing growth in investment, bolstered by the need to address labour shortages.", "Recent data suggested that growth in China had eased further. Most indicators of economic activity hadslowed in July, including in components being supported by recent policy measures, such asinfrastructure investment.

However, domestic demand elsewhere in the region had held up, supported by governmentpolicies in some cases.", "Iron ore prices had declined since the previous meeting, but were around 40 per cent higherthan a year earlier. Market reports had attributed these declines to a number of factors, includingconcerns about the outlook for steel demand in China following the escalation of the disputes betweenthe United States and China in early August, lower steel prices and an easing in supply concerns.

Members noted that the outlook for the construction sector wasparticularly weak.", "Members recognised that, overall, Australian businesses had not appeared to have been affected by theweak trade environment to the same extent as businesses in other advanced economies. This was partlybecause Australia's exports are more exposed to Chinese domestic demand and less integrated inglobal supply chains.", "Consumption growth was expected to have remained low in the June quarter. Retail sales volumes had beenweak in the June quarter and the value of retail sales had fallen in July. The low- and middle-incometax offset (LMITO) was expected to boost household income, and thus support consumption growth, incoming quarters. However, the Bank's liaison with retailers suggested that this had yet to liftspending noticeably. Members noted that even if the LMITO was used to pay off debts, this would stillbring forward the point at which households could increase their spending.", "Established housing market conditions had steadied in recent months. Reported housing prices in Sydneyand Melbourne had risen noticeably in August and auction clearance rates had increased further, althoughvolumes had remained low. Housing market conditions had been subdued elsewhere, although there weresigns of housing prices stabilising in Brisbane. Housing turnover had remained low. Consequently,spending on home furnishings and other housing-related items was not expected to contribute toconsumption growth in the near term.

Employment growth over preceding months had been broadly based across states andhad predominantly been in full-time work. Strong employment growth had been accompanied by a furtherincrease in the participation rate, which had recorded another all-time high. Members noted that theincrease in participation had been particularly notable for New South Wales. Forward-looking indicatorshad continued to suggest that employment growth would moderate over the following six months.Information from liaison suggested employment intentions had remained weak in the residentialconstruction sector but positive among services firms.", "Wages growth had remained low and the upward trend in wages growth appeared to have stalled. The wageprice index had increased by 2.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter. Private sectorwages growth had been unchanged in the quarter, while public sector wages growth had been a littlehigher. Most of this increase had been the result of a one-off adjustment to equalise the wages ofnurses and midwives in Victoria with those in New South Wales."], "Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that government bond yields haddeclined and were at record lows in many countries, including Australia. Volatility and risk premiums inglobal financial markets had increased in August, following the escalation of the disputes between theUnited States and China and disappointing economic data releases in Germany and China. The persistentdownside risks to the global economy, combined with subdued inflation, had led a number of central banksto reduce interest rates in recent months and further monetary easing was widely expected.", "In the United States, market pricing implied that the federal funds rate was expected to decline byaround 100 basis points over the following year. Market participants also expected the EuropeanCentral Bank to provide additional monetary stimulus in the near term, including renewed asset purchasesand a reduction in its policy rate further into negative territory. Central banks in a number of otheradvanced economies had also eased policy, or signalled that they were prepared to do so, in response tosubdued inflation, moderating activity and downside risks to growth. For similar reasons, central banksin emerging markets had also been easing policy over recent months and had signalled the possibility offurther easing.", "Financial conditions for corporations remained accommodative globally. This reflected marketparticipants' ongoing expectations that central banks were likely to deliver further monetaryeasing to sustain the global economic expansion. Corporate bond spreads had increased a little inAugust, but remained low. Equity prices had declined somewhat, reflecting concerns about the outlook forgrowth, but remained substantially higher over the year to date. In Australia, equity prices were5 per cent below the record high reached in late July. Australian listed companies'profits had risen, driven by the resources sector. At the aggregate level, companies had increased theirdividends over the preceding year, although this reflected higher dividends in the resources sector inparticular.", "In China, the authorities had intervened to support three small banks in preceding months, and thePeople's Bank of China had continued to maintain a high level of liquidity in the banking system.While funding conditions for smaller banks had tightened this year, money market rates and corporate andgovernment bond yields in China had generally remained low and market participants were expectingfurther easing in monetary policy in the period ahead.", "In foreign exchange markets, the Chinese renminbi had depreciated against the US dollar in Augustfollowing the escalation of the US–China disputes, while the Japanese yen had appreciated overthe month. The Australian dollar had been little changed at around its lowest level in some years.", "In Australia, borrowing rates for both businesses and households were at historically low levels, aswere banks' funding costs. Variable mortgage rates had declined broadly in line with the reductionsin the cash rate in June and July. Fixed mortgage rates had also declined substantially over thepreceding six months. Financial market pricing continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to belowered by another 25 basis points by November 2019, with a further cut expected in the early partof 2020.", "Growth in housing credit had been little changed over the year to July, having declined steadilythrough 2018. Credit to investors had declined slightly over previous months. Meanwhile, housing loanapprovals to both owner-occupiers and investors had increased for the second consecutive month in July.This pick-up in loan approvals had followed a significant decline over the preceding two years and wasconsistent with the signs of stabilisation in the established housing market. Borrowing by largebusinesses had continued to grow at a relatively strong pace. In contrast, small businesses' accessto finance remained difficult, and had become more difficult over the preceding year as banks hadtightened their lending practices. While new sources of non-traditional finance had been growing,including equity funding from family offices and private equity funds, they remained a small share ofbusiness funding.", "Members had a detailed discussion of the ways in which financial conditions abroad affect Australia.They discussed how shifts in world interest rates and global risk premiums flow through to domesticfinancial conditions. While Australia's floating exchange rate means that monetary policy can beset largely according to domestic considerations, members discussed the large shifts insavings/investment decisions globally, which were affecting the level of interest rates everywhere,including in Australia. Members also noted the critical role that the exchange rate had played over manyyears as a shock absorber for the Australian economy. One important factor here has been that Australianentities raising offshore funding are able to do so in Australian dollars, either directly or viahedging markets."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["Turning to the policy decision, members observed that the news on the international economy hadconfirmed that the risks to the global growth outlook were to the downside. The trade disputes betweenthe United States and China had escalated and growth in China had continued to slow. There had beenfurther indications that these developments were affecting trade and investment decisions in overseaseconomies, although businesses had continued hiring and labour market conditions had remainedtight.", "Against this backdrop and with ongoing low inflation, a number of central banks had reduced interestrates over recent months and further monetary easing was widely expected. Long-term government bondyields had declined and were at record lows in many countries, including Australia. Borrowing rates forboth businesses and households were also at historically low levels, and the Australian dollar exchangerate was at the lowest level that it had been in recent times.", "Domestically, members considered a number of developments over preceding months that had a bearing onthe monetary policy decision. First, employment had continued to grow strongly and the participationrate was at a record high. However, the unemployment rate had remained steady at around5.2 per cent over recent months. At the same time, wages growth had remained low and therewere few indications that wage pressures were building. Members noted that a further gradual lift inwages growth would be a welcome development. Taken together, recent outcomes suggested that sparecapacity remained in the labour market and that the Australian economy could sustain lower rates ofunemployment and underemployment.", "Second, there had been further signs of a turnaround in established housing markets, especially inSydney and Melbourne, although housing turnover had remained low. Housing credit growth had remainedsubdued, although mortgage rates were at record low levels and there was strong competition forborrowers of high credit quality. Data on residential building approvals and information from theBank's liaison program suggested that there was likely to be further weakness in dwellinginvestment in the near term; members recognised that this could sow the seeds of an upswing in thehousing price cycle at some point, particularly given the lengthy stages in the construction ofhigher-density residential housing. Demand for credit by investors continued to be subdued and creditconditions, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, remained tight.", "Finally, based on partial indicators, GDP growth in the June quarter was expected to have been around½ per cent. The largest contributions to growth were expected to have been from exportsand public demand. Private final demand, which includes consumption, business investment and dwellinginvestment, was expected to have been weak.", "Looking forward, the outlook for output growth was being supported by the low level of interest rates,recent tax cuts, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets and a brighter outlook forthe resources sector. A key uncertainty continued to be the outlook for consumption growth, which wasexpected to increase over time, supported by a gradual pick-up in growth in household disposable incomeand improvements in conditions in the housing market. Inflation pressures remained subdued, butinflation was expected to increase gradually to be a little above 2 per cent over 2021 asoutput growth picked up and the labour market tightened.", "Based on the information available, members judged that it was reasonable to expect that an extendedperiod of low interest rates would be required in Australia to make sustained progress towards fullemployment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target. Members would assessdevelopments in both the international and domestic economies, including labour market conditions, andwould ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy and theachievement of the inflation target over time."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.00 per cent."]}},

In Japan, exports had declined further, although output growth intheSeptember quarter had been supported by above-average household spending ahead of an increase intheconsumption tax in October.", "In east Asia, export volumes had been flat for several months. Other indicators of activity, suchasindustrial production and surveys of manufacturing conditions, had shown tentative signs ofstabilising.Growth in output had also slowed in India, driven by weakness in consumption.

Year-ended growth had slowed to 1.4 per cent, the lowest outcome in adecade.Nevertheless, there had been a pick-up in quarterly GDP growth over the first half of 2019compared withthe second half of 2018. The pick-up had been driven by stronger growth in exports, led byexports ofresources and manufacturing goods. Members noted that export demand was being supported by thelowerlevel of the Australian dollar. Public demand had also been growing strongly, partly because ofspendingon the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Members observed that the drought had continued toaffectthe rural sector to a significant extent and that, as a result, farm output was expected toremain weakover the following year.", "Growth in household disposable income had been subdued. Strong growth in income tax paid byhouseholdshad been a contributing factor, as had been low growth in non-labour income, partly reflectingtheeffects of the drought on the farm sector. By contrast, strong employment growth had boostedgrowth inlabour income.", "Consistent with the ongoing low growth in household disposable income, household consumption hadincreased by only 1.4 per cent over the year to the end of June. Members noted thatthere hadnot yet been evidence of a pick-up in household spending following the recent reductions in thecashrate and receipt of the tax offset payments, although they acknowledged that it may be too earlytoexpect any signs of a pick-up. Retail sales had remained subdued in July and car sales haddecreased inAugust. Despite weak reported retail sales conditions generally, on a slightly more positivenote somecontacts in the Bank's liaison program had reported a mild pick-up in retail sales sinceJuly.Responses to consumer surveys in September had suggested that, on average, households planned tospendaround half of their lump-sum tax payments, broadly in line with what had been assumed in theBank's most recent forecasts.", "The residential construction sector had contracted further and this was expected to continue forsometime. The decline in dwelling investment in the June quarter was greater than had been expecteda fewmonths earlier. Higher-density approvals had declined in July, to be at their lowest level insevenyears; detached approvals had also declined in July.

Nevertheless, the outlook for non-mining businessinvestmentremained favourable, supported by investment in infrastructure. Mining investment had picked uplargelyas expected. Members noted that mining investment was expected to continue to increasegradually,supported by projects both to sustain and to expand production. Survey measures of businessconditionshad remained around average in August; members noted that conditions in retailing were reportedto havebeen very weak, while conditions in the mining industry had remained well above average.", "Conditions in the labour market had continued to be mixed. Employment growth in August hadremainedstronger than growth in the working-age population, and the employment-to-population ratio hadreachedits highest level since late 2008. Employment had increased by 2½ per cent overthepreceding year, the third successive year of strong employment growth. The participation ratehad alsoincreased to another record high. Members noted that the strong demand for labour had been metby anequally strong increase in supply. The unemployment rate had been around 5¼ per centsince April and the underemployment rate had remained above its recent low point.

Members noted that a sharp slowdown in globalgrowthcould result from an escalation of the US–China trade and technology disputes orgeopoliticaltensions in the Middle East, Hong Kong or the Korean peninsula. Central banks had eased monetarypolicyin response to the potential for weaker growth, and additional easing was expected by markets,leadingto falls in long-term government bond yields. Despite the increased uncertainty, risk premiumswere lowand in some cases had fallen further. The lower risk-free interest rates and low term, creditandliquidity risk premiums had seen many asset prices increase further. Any shock that causedmarkets toincrease risk premiums or revise upwards expectations of future policy rates, such as a pick-upininflation without accompanying stronger growth, could see a broad range of asset prices fall.Given debtlevels were high in some non-financial sectors in some economies, a fall in asset prices couldresult infinancial stress for some businesses and households, which could spill over to financialinstitutions.", "Members observed that there had been strong growth in corporate debt in the United States, FranceandCanada, particularly lower-quality debt. Members noted that borrowers whose credit ratings fellbelowinvestment grade, and who relied on market-based finance, could face difficulty accessingfunding, givenmany investors' mandates were constrained by credit ratings. The interaction of highsovereign debtand less resilient banks in Japan and some European economies was also seen as a risk. However,in theUnited States and the United Kingdom, the resilience of the banking system had increased asprofitability had improved.", "Corporate debt in China had increased sharply over the previous decade, although in relation toGDP ithad declined recently in response to policy measures to promote deleveraging.

Prices in those cities had fallen by alittleunder 10 per cent over the preceding 18 months, reducing the housing equity ofhouseholdsand resulting in a small share with negative equity. The recent increase in housing prices inthosecities had reduced the risk of large increases in negative equity, which could result in lossesforlenders if declines in income reduced households' ability to meet debt repayments. Half ofallloans in negative equity were in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, where housingpricedeclines had persisted over the previous few years. Members noted that the rate of mortgagearrears inWestern Australia had increased by more for riskier types of lending, including lending withsmallerdeposits, higher repayments relative to income, and loans to investors and self-employedborrowers.", "Despite the high level of household debt in Australia relative to other countries, the risks fromhousehold debt appeared to be mostly contained. While the share of mortgages in arrears hadcontinued torise, it remained at a low rate relative to many other countries and in absolute terms. Inaddition, thequality of new lending had increased in recent years. The shares of loans with highloan-to-valuationratios and with interest-only repayment terms had declined following a focus by regulators onthishigher-risk lending. Further, members noted that households continued to have large prepaymentson theirhousing debt. In aggregate, mortgage prepayments were equal to two-and-a-half years ofrepayments.However, while one-third of borrowers had prepayments exceeding two years of mortgagerepayments, aslightly lower share had very little or no buffers. Of these, a little less than half appearedmorelikely to be vulnerable to shocks to their ability to meet their mortgage payments.", "The resilience of Australian banks had increased since the financial crisis. Banks had largelycompleted their transition to their higher ‘unquestionably strong’ capital ratios.Banks' resilience would increase further with the introduction by the Australian PrudentialRegulation Authority of a Loss Absorbing Capacity (LAC) regime, which will require banks toraise anadditional 3 percentage points of capital by 2024. Members observed that banks were alreadyissuingnew Tier 2 securities to meet their LAC requirements. Banks' profitability haddeclined alittle over the prior year or two, although banks remained highly profitable. The increase inhousingarrears had resulted in a small decline in banks' overall asset quality, although assetqualityremained high.

The trade and technology disputes between the United States andChinawere affecting international trade and investment, as businesses scaled back their spendingplans inresponse to increased uncertainty.

In most advanced economies,inflation remained subdued despite low unemployment rates and rising wages growth.", "In this context, global interest rates had continued to decline, with the central banks in theUnitedStates and Europe reducing interest rates in the previous month. Further monetary easing waswidelyexpected, as central banks continued to respond to the downside risks to the global economy andsubduedinflation.

Members noted that the Bank's most recent forecasts suggested thattheunemployment and inflation outcomes over the following couple of years were likely to be shortof theBank's goals. The most recent run of data had not materially altered this assessment and,onbalance, had been on the softer side. The ongoing subdued rate of wages growth also suggestedthat theeconomy still had spare capacity. There was therefore a case to respond to the general outlookwith afurther easing of monetary policy.", "Members were mindful, however, that monetary policy was already expansionary and that the lowerexchange rate was also supporting growth. They acknowledged that these factors and the recenttax cutscould combine to boost growth by more than their individual effects would imply, especiallygiven thecontext of the mining and established housing sectors seeming to have reached turning points. Atthesame time, members recognised that it was possible that the effects may be smaller than expectedand theglobal risks were to the downside.", "Members also considered the argument that some monetary stimulus should be kept in reserve toaddressany future negative shocks. However, that argument requires changes in interest rates to be thekeydriver of demand, rather than the level of interest rates, which experience has shown to be themoreimportant determinant. Members concluded that the Board could reduce the likelihood of anegative shockleading to outcomes that materially undershot the Bank's goals by strengthening thestarting pointfor the economy.", "The Board's discussions also focused on the ongoing strength in employment growth. Theperiod ofstrong employment growth had not reduced spare capacity in the labour market significantly.Almost allof the strength in employment growth over the preceding three years had been matched by higherparticipation, so there had been little progress on reducing unemployment and underemployment.It wasalso possible that participation was rising partly in response to weak growth in incomes.Moreover,employment growth was forecast to slow over the period ahead.", "Members also discussed the possibility that policy stimulus might be less effective than pastexperience suggests. They recognised that some transmission channels, such as a pick-up inborrowing orthe effect on the home-building sector, may not be operating in the same way as in the past, andthatthe negative effect of low interest rates on the income and confidence of savers might be moresignificant. Notwithstanding this, transmission through the exchange rate channel was stillconsideredlikely to work effectively, and evidence suggested that the positive effects of lower interestrates onaggregate household cash flows via lower debt repayments was likely to support householdspending, giventhat household interest payments exceed receipts by more than two to one.", "Members also noted that the housing market and other asset prices might be overly inflated bylowerinterest rates. Members acknowledged that asset prices were part of the transmission mechanismofpolicy, including by encouraging home building. By themselves, higher asset prices wereconsideredunlikely to present a risk to macroeconomic and financial stability. This assessment would needto bereviewed if rapidly increasing asset prices were accompanied by materially faster credit growth,weaklending standards and rising leverage. Although household debt was still considered high,members sawonly a limited risk of excessive borrowing at the current juncture: household disposable incomegrowth(and thus borrowing capacity) is weak; the memory of recent housing price falls is still fresh;andbanks are still quite cautious in their appetite to lend. Nonetheless, members assessed thatclosemonitoring of this risk was warranted.", "Members concluded that these various factors did not outweigh the case for a further easing ofmonetarypolicy at the present meeting. Taking into account all the available information, including thereductions in interest rates since the middle of the year, the Board decided to lower the cashrate by afurther 25 basis points. Members judged that lower interest rates would help reduce sparecapacityin the economy by supporting employment and income growth and providing greater confidence thatinflation would be consistent with the medium-term target. Members also noted the trend to lowerinterest rates globally and the effect this was having on the Australian economy and inflationoutcomes.", "Members judged it reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates would berequiredin Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. The Board would continuetomonitor developments, including in the labour market, and was prepared to ease monetary policyfurtherif needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement oftheinflation target over time."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent."]}},

In theUnited States and Japan, recent wage increases had been larger for low-wage earners than high-wageearners.", "Core inflation had remained subdued in most economies and, following weaker inflation data in theUnited States, was below target in the three major advanced economies.", "There had been some large movements in commodity prices over recent months. Iron ore prices hadremained high as a result of supply disruptions in Brazil and Australia. Oil prices had also risen,which had led to higher headline consumer price inflation in most economies and was expected to flowthrough to higher prices for Australian liquefied natural gas exports over the following couple ofquarters. As a result, the forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised higher, butthey were still expected to decline over the forecast period to the middle of 2021."], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that growth had been subdued inthe second half of 2018. Indicators of household consumption suggested that growth had remained subduedin the March quarter. In addition, demand for new dwelling construction was expected to have remainedweak. These factors had been the main drivers of a downward revision to the domestic growth outlook inthe near term. Beyond 2019, these effects were broadly offset by upward revisions to export growth andsome newly announced mining investment projects. Members noted that, overall, the Bank expectedyear-ended GDP growth to be 2¾ per cent over 2019 and 2020.", "Growth in consumption had been weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 and retail sales datafor the March quarter suggested that this weakness had continued into 2019. Members noted that, as hadbeen the case for some time, the outlook for growth in consumption was a key uncertainty for the overallgrowth outlook. The risks to consumption were tilted to the downside, given the extended period of lowincome growth and the adjustment occurring in housing markets. The forecast for an improvement in growthin consumption depended on an increase in growth in household disposable income over the forecastperiod. The forecast increase in household disposable income growth was supported by employment growth,a pick-up in wages growth and lower growth in tax payments, partly because of the introduction of thelow- and middle-income tax offsets announced in the Australian Government 2019-20 Budget. Members notedthat there was uncertainty about the outlook for fiscal policy and how this might affect the outlook forgrowth in household disposable income.", "Housing markets had remained weak in the preceding month. The rental vacancy rate in Sydney hadincreased to the highest level in around 15 years and housing prices in established markets hadcontinued to decline. More positively, the pace of price declines had moderated and the modest recoveryin auction clearance rates since the start of the year had been sustained.", "Information obtained through the Bank's liaison program continued to indicate that salesconditions for off-the-plan apartments and new detached housing had been difficult. The spike inresidential building approvals in February had largely been unwound in March, confirming that underlyingconditions for new dwelling activity remained weak. Data released since the previous meeting had shownthat the pipeline of residential work to be done had decreased in the December quarter, but remainedhigh. Members notedthat the forecasts for dwelling investment suggested that population growth could exceed growth in thestock of housing towards the end of the forecast period, and that this possibility had been suggested bya number of the Bank's liaison contacts.", "Survey measures of business conditions had moved a little higher in March and April and had remainedslightly above average, though well below the high levels that had prevailed throughout most of 2018.Forward-looking indicators of non-mining business investment had been mixed; non-residential buildingapprovals had declined, but the pipeline of infrastructure work remained high. Non-mining businessinvestment was expected to support growth in output over the forecast period.", "Mining investment had declined in the December quarter, but was expected to increase over the forecastperiod, reflecting investment required to sustain current production levels and an expectation that anumber of new projects would commence towards the end of the forecast period. Recent trade datasuggested resource exports would contribute to output growth in the March quarter, and exports wereexpected to contribute to output growth throughout the forecast period. Members noted that the forecastpick-up in rural exports from 2020 depended on a return to normal weather conditions.", "Public demand was expected to continue to support aggregate growth over the forecast period; asignificant share of this expenditure was associated with delivering goods and services to households,such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Members noted that the Victorian Government hadannounced measures to contain growth in labour costs in an environment of expected lower stamp dutyrevenues.", "Growth in employment in the March quarter had been strong, following similar outcomes over much of2018. Most of the growth in employment since mid 2018 had been in full-time employment. Theunemployment rate had remained around 5 per cent in March. Members observed that conditions inthe labour market had signalled a significantly stronger pace of economic activity since mid 2018than indicated by the GDP data. Leading indicators of labour demand had eased over recent months andprovided a mixed picture of the near-term outlook. As a result, employment growth was expected to besimilar to the growth rate of the working-age population in the near term. The unemployment rate wasexpected to remain around 5 per cent through most of the forecast period, before declining toaround 4¾ per cent in 2021.", "Members noted that the forecasts for the labour market suggested that there would be some sparecapacity in the labour market throughout the forecast period, although there was uncertainty about howquickly the spare capacity would decline and how progress would feed into wage pressures. The centralforecast was for wages growth to pick up gradually. In combination, the forecasts for wages growth andconsumer price inflation implied that real consumer wage growth would be low but positive over theforecast period.", "The inflation data in the March quarter CPI release were noticeably lower than expected. The CPIincreased by 0.1 per cent (seasonally adjusted) in the quarter, while the underlying rate ofinflation was ¼ per cent. In year-ended terms, headline inflation was1.3 per cent, with the underlying rate at 1½ per cent. The earlier exchangerate depreciation and the drought-related increase in some food prices had led to relatively strongretail price inflation in the March quarter. However, these inflationary pressures had been more thanoffset by broad-based weakness in other CPI components, which was likely to be more persistent.", "Rental inflation had remained low, driven by a marked slowing in rental inflation in Sydney; data onnewly advertised rents suggested that rents had started to pick up in Perth. Developer discounts andincentives had weighed on the prices of newly built homes, particularly in Melbourne and Brisbane. Arange of government policy decisions had contributed to lower inflation in administered prices in recentquarters. Market and survey-based measures of inflation expectations had declined in recent months, ashad been the case in other advanced economies.", "Members noted that the recent CPI data had led the Bank to reassess the disinflationary effects of theweak housing market. Combined with the lower GDP growth outlook, this had led to a downward revision tothe inflation outlook, although there was also some uncertainty about the persistence of downwardpressure from utilities and administered price changes and the effect of housing market weakness. Thecentral forecast scenario was for underlying inflation of around 1¾ per cent over 2019,2 per cent over 2020 and a little higher after that."], "Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that global financialconditions were accommodative and had eased significantly since the start of the year. Marketexpectations for the future path of monetary policy in a number of economies had declined earlier in theyear, in line with guidance from major central banks that policy was likely to be more accommodativethan previously expected. The expectation that policy rates would remain little changed for some timehad contributed to very low levels of volatility in most financial markets.", "In the United States, with inflation close to but a bit below target and the federal funds rate closeto neutral, the Federal Reserve (Fed) had reiterated that it would take a patient and flexible approachto its policy decisions. While the Fed's recent forecast update implied that one more policy rateincrease was likely by the end of 2020, market pricing implied that the Fed was expected to lower itspolicy rate around twice over that period. At its April meeting, the European Central Bank hadreiterated that it expected policy rates to remain at current levels at least through to the end of2019. The Bank of Japan had indicated that its very stimulatory policy settings will remain in placeuntil at least mid 2020. Market participants expected the next moves in policy rates in Canada, NewZealand and Australia to be down.", "Government bond yields remained at very low levels in the advanced economies, having declined sincelate 2018 in line with downward revisions to growth and inflation projections, and the lowering ofpolicy rate expectations by market participants. In Germany and Japan, long-term bond yields were aroundzero, close to the record lows of 2016. Members noted that Australian government bond yields haddeclined by more than those in other major markets over the preceding six months, followingweaker-than-expected inflation data and a lower expected path for monetary policy. By contrast, Chinesegovernment bond yields had increased over the preceding month, as signs emerged that policy stimulusthere was providing support to economic activity.", "Members noted that, following the brief inversion of segments of the US yield curve in March, the slopeof the US yield curve had increased a little in April. While market commentators had noted that pastepisodes of yield curve inversion had tended to precede recessions, the decline in credit spreads andrise in equity valuations in 2019 suggested market participants did not perceive this to be a particularrisk.", "Members observed that financing conditions for corporations remained favourable. In the advancedeconomies, corporate bond yields had declined, partly because of a decline in spreads. In addition,equity prices had increased substantially since the start of 2019 to be at their highest levels in overa decade, including in Australia.", "In China, growth in total social financing had been steady in recent months and a little higher than in2018, supported by bank lending and bond issuance. Off-balance sheet financing had continued to decline,reflecting the authorities' efforts to discourage riskier forms of financing. Members noted thatthe Chinese authorities had introduced additional measures to encourage banks to lend to small privatesector firms, which had previously made use of off-balance sheet financing that was now less readilyavailable. Members also noted the substantial local government bond issuance to finance infrastructureprojects, which was a key part of the authorities' stimulus measures.", "In foreign exchange markets, volatility had remained low over the preceding month, including in mostemerging markets. Members noted, however, that risks remained pronounced for a small number of economieswith specific vulnerabilities, most notably Turkey and Argentina, where financial conditions hadtightened again.", "The Australian dollar had depreciated a little following the weaker-than-expected March quarter CPIrelease, but overall had been little changed over recent months and remained around the lower end of itsnarrow range of the past few years. Members noted that this reflected the offsetting influences of therise in commodity prices and decline in Australian government bond yields relative to those in the majormarkets over 2019. The difference between long-term government bond yields in the United States andAustralia had increased to a historically large 75 basis points.", "Housing credit growth had slowed over the preceding year, but the monthly pace of growth had stabilisedover recent months. In three-month-ended annualised terms, growth in housing lending was around4½ per cent for owner-occupiers and ½ per cent for investors. Loanapprovals also appeared to have stabilised in recent months. Members noted that, although lendingpractices were tighter than they had been for some time, the decline in housing credit growth over thepreceding year had been driven largely by weaker demand for finance, associated with the decline inhousing prices.", "The average interest rate charged on outstanding variable-rate housing loans had remained broadlysteady. While banks had increased their standard variable reference rates since mid 2018, rates onnew loans had remained materially below the average of those on outstanding loans. Members noted thatbanks had recently reduced the rates charged on new fixed-rate loans.", "Funding costs for the major banks had declined to record lows in preceding months, as the increase inshort-term money market rates in 2018 had been fully unwound and retail deposit rates had continued toedge lower. Despite the low cost of funding, bank bond issuance in 2019 so far had been a little belowthe average of recent years. Issuance of bonds by other corporations and of residential mortgage-backedsecurities had been broadly in line with the average of recent years.", "The pace of growth in business lending had been maintained in recent months at rates that were abovethose of the preceding few years, driven by lending to large businesses. Lending to small businesses haddeclined over the preceding year. Interest rates on variable-rate loans to large businesses, which arelinked to bank bill swap rates, had declined in the March quarter. Members observed that the ratescharged on small business loans remained markedly higher than those on large business loans, with thegap between small and large business loan rates having doubled following the global financialcrisis.", "Financial market participants' expectations of cash rate cuts were brought further forwardfollowing the release of the March quarter CPI. Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate wasexpected to be lowered by 25 basis points within the next three months and again by the end of2019."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that growth in Australia's majortrading partners had slowed, driven by a sharp slowing in global trade associated with slower growth inChina. Members also noted, however, that targeted stimulus measures in China appeared to be having aneffect and global financial conditions remained very accommodative. In a number of advanced economies,labour markets had continued to tighten and wages growth had increased, but inflationary pressures hadremained subdued.", "Domestically, members noted that the sustained low level of interest rates over recent years had beensupporting economic activity and had contributed to a decline in the unemployment rate. However,household income growth had remained low and the March quarter inflation data indicated that theinflationary pressures in the Australian economy were lower than previously thought.", "After updating the forecasts for the new information, the central forecast scenario remained forprogress to be made on the Bank's goals of reducing unemployment and returning inflation towardsthe midpoint of the target, but at a more gradual pace than previously expected. Under the centralscenario, GDP growth had been revised lower in the near term, but was expected to pick up to be around2¾ per cent over 2019 and 2020. The unemployment rate was expected to remain around5 per cent over 2019 and 2020before declining a little to 4¾ per cent in 2021. This implied that spare capacity wouldremain in the economy for some time. Given this, and the subdued inflationary pressures across theeconomy, underlying inflation was expected to be 1¾ per cent over 2019,2 per cent over 2020 and a little higher after that.", "Members noted that the central forecast scenario was based on the usual technical assumption that thecash rate followed the path implied by market pricing, which suggested interest rates were expected tobe lower over the next six months. This implied that, without an easing in monetary policy over the nextsix months, growth and inflation outcomes would be expected to be less favourable than the centralscenario.", "At the same time, members also recognised that there were risks to the forecasts in both directions.The risks to the global economy remained tilted to the downside, with uncertainty remaining around theevolution of international trade policy. Domestically, the outlook for household consumption remained akey uncertainty, with the risks tilted to the downside given ongoing low income growth and theadjustment occurring in housing markets. On the upside, it was possible that the combined effects ofcontinued accommodative financial conditions, the increase in Australia's terms of trade, arenewed expansion in the resources sector and the expected lift in household disposable income growthwould result in stronger growth in output than in the central forecast scenario.", "Members discussed the outlook for the domestic labour market in some detail. As in the previousmeeting, members discussed the scenario where inflation did not move any higher and unemployment trendedup, recognising that in those circumstances a decrease in the cash rate would likely be appropriate. Asnoted at the previous meeting, members recognised that the effect on the economy of lower interest ratescould be expected to be smaller than in the past, given the high level of household debt and theadjustment that was occurring in housing markets. Nevertheless, a lower level of interest rates couldstill be expected to support the economy through a depreciation of the exchange rate and by reducingrequired interest payments on borrowing, freeing up cash for other expenditure.", "In light of the recent run of inflation data, the Board then discussed the likelihood that the economycould sustain a stronger labour market with lower rates of unemployment than previously estimated, whileachieving inflation consistent with the target. In this context, members observed that the recentinternational experience was that inflation had remained low despite historically low rates ofunemployment. Given the international evidence and the recent Australian inflation data, members agreedthat a further decline in the unemployment rate would be consistent with achieving Australia'smedium-term inflation target. Given this, members considered the scenario where there was no furtherimprovement in the labour market in the period ahead, recognising that in those circumstances a decreasein the cash rate would likely be appropriate.", "Taking into account all the available information, including the various uncertainties about theoutlook, members judged that it was appropriate to hold the stance of monetary policy unchanged at thismeeting, noting that holding monetary policy steady had enabled the Bank to be a source of stability andconfidence over recent years. In view of the spare capacity that remained in the economy, however,members agreed that it was important to continue to pay close attention to developments in the labourmarket and set monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and achieve the inflationtarget over time."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent."]}},

GDP growth outcomes for the March quarter in some economies had beenslightly stronger than the second half of 2018, while labour markets had remained tight. However, globaltrade and conditions in the global manufacturing sector had remained weak. New export orders had beenlittle changed at subdued levels and growth in industrial production had slowed in many economies,including those economies in east Asia that are closely integrated with global supply chains.", "The US–China trade dispute had escalated in May, intensifying the downside risk posed to theglobal economic outlook from this source. The United States had proceeded to increase tariffs from10 per cent to 25 per cent on US$200 billion of imports from China, and China hadresponded by announcing that tariffs would increase by 5–25 per cent onUS$60 billion of US imports from 1 June 2019. In the days leading up to the meeting, theUS administration had also announced tariff measures affecting Mexico and India.", "In the major advanced economies, GDP growth for the March quarter had been somewhat stronger than inthe second half of 2018. However, in both Japan and the United States the contribution from domesticdemand had declined, and investment intentions in Japan pointed to only moderate investment growth overthe period to early 2020. Nevertheless, labour markets in the advanced economies had remained tight. Asa result, wages growth had continued to increase, reaching around the highest rates recorded during thecurrent expansion in the three major advanced economies. Moreover, firms' employment intentionshad remained positive at high levels and firms had continued to report widespread difficulties infilling jobs.", "Inflation had remained subdued globally despite tight labour markets and rising wages growth in manyadvanced economies. Core inflation had been below target in the three major advanced economies,following the decline in core inflation in the United States in recent months. Members noted thattemporary factors had been contributing to the decline in the US core inflation measure, with thetrimmed mean underlying inflation measure close to 2 per cent over recent months.", "In China, indicators of activity had moderated in April. The moderation had partly reversed theunusually strong results in March, which had included activity brought forward ahead of tax changes thatcame into effect on 1 April 2019. Growth in fixed asset investment had slowed in April, driven by asharp fall in manufacturing investment, while infrastructure investment had been supported by increasedgovernment spending. Industrial production had slowed across a wide range of products in April, althoughproduction of construction-related materials – such as steel, plate glass and cement – hadremained strong.", "Elsewhere in east Asia, growth had slowed further in the March quarter, mainly because of weaker growthin exports and investment. Growth in India had been at the lower end of the range of recent experience,with members noting that the recent tariff announcements by the US administration could adversely affectIndian exports of goods.", "Commodity price movements had been mixed since the previous meeting. Iron ore and rural prices hadincreased. The increase in iron ore prices had been underpinned by supply constraints, strong demandfrom China and an increase in steel production. On the other hand, the prices of coal, oil and basemetals had declined. Members noted that the decline in oil prices had mainly reflected renewed concernsaround the outlook for global oil demand."], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members noted that national accounts data for GDP growth in the March quarter would be released the dayafter the meeting. GDP growth was expected to have been a little firmer than in the preceding twoquarters, supported by growth in exports, non-mining business investment and public spending. Growth inconsumption, however, was expected to continue to be sluggish and dwelling investment was expected tohave declined further in the March quarter.", "Information received for the June quarter and indicators of future economic activity had been mixed.Business conditions and consumer sentiment had been broadly stable at or slightly above average levels.Information from the ABS capital expenditure survey and the Bank's business liaison contactssuggested that mining investment was close to its trough, while the available information pointed toongoing modest growth in non-residential building investment. Members noted that the low- andmiddle-income tax offset, including the increase announced in the Australian Government Budget for<span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span>, would boost household disposable income and could support householdconsumption in the second half of 2019.", "Members also discussed the distributional implications of low interest rates on household incomes.Lower interest rates lead to a decline in the interest that households pay on their debt, but also leadto a decline in the interest income that households receive from interest-bearing assets, such as termdeposits. As such, changes in interest rates have different effects on different groups of households.In particular, members recognised that many older Australians rely on interest income, which woulddecline with lower interest rates. The overall net effect of lower interest rates was neverthelessexpected to boost aggregate household disposable income and thus spending capacity.", "Conditions in established housing markets had remained weak. Housing prices had continued to decline inSydney and Melbourne during May, although the pace of decline had eased from earlier in the year.Housing prices had continued to decline markedly in Perth. Members noted that the housing market waslikely to be affected by the removal of uncertainty around possible changes to taxation arrangementsrelating to housing. They also considered the effects of the Australian Prudential RegulationAuthority's (APRA's) proposal to amend its requirement for banks to determine theborrowing capacity of loan applicants using a specified minimum interest rate. While it remained tooearly to determine the overall effects, auction clearance rates had increased noticeably in Sydney theweekend following these developments. Building approvals had declined further in April, however, to bemore than 20 per cent lower over the preceding 12 months. This suggested that, even ifthere were a marked turnaround in housing sentiment, given the lags involved it would take some time forthis to translate into higher residential construction activity.", "Several key domestic data series relating to the labour market had been released over the previousmonth. The wage price index had increased by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter to be2.3 per cent higher over the year. While wages growth had been higher than a year earlier inmost industries and states, the low rate of wages growth provided further evidence of spare capacity inthe labour market. Wages growth in the private sector had been unchanged in the March quarter, and hadincreased to 2.4 per cent over the year (2.7 per cent including bonuses). The FairWork Commission had recently granted a 3.0 per cent increase in the national minimum and awardclassification wages, which would take effect from 1 July 2019. Members noted that this decisiondirectly affected the wages of around one-fifth of workers in Australia. Public sector wages growth hadbeen little changed in recent years because of caps on salary increases for public sector employees.Members also noted that an increasing proportion of business liaison contacts were expecting wagesgrowth to be stable in the year ahead, although the proportion of contacts expecting wages growth todecline had continued to fall.", "The data on conditions in the labour market in April had been mixed. The unemployment rate hadincreased to 5.2 per cent in April from (an upwardly revised) 5.1 per cent in March.This followed a six-month period during which the unemployment rate had remained at around5 per cent. The increase in the unemployment rate had been accompanied by an increase in theparticipation rate to its highest level on record. The underemployment rate had also increased in April.While the unemployment rate in both New South Wales and Victoria remained historically low, in bothstates it had increased since the beginning of 2019. Employment growth nationwide had moderated in 2019,but had remained above growth in the working-age population. Employment growth had been robust in moststates in preceding months; the exceptions were Western Australia and Tasmania, where the level ofemployment had been roughly unchanged since mid 2018.", "Forward-looking indicators of labour demand pointed to a moderation in employment growth in the nearterm, to around the rate of growth in the working-age population. Measures of job advertisements haddeclined over recent months. Employment intentions reported by the Bank's business liaisoncontacts had been lower than in mid 2018, but these intentions were still generally positive.", "Members had a detailed discussion of spare capacity in the labour market. Although difficult to measuredirectly, the extent of spare capacity in the labour market is an important factor that affects wagesgrowth and price inflation. On a number of measures, it was apparent that the labour market still hadsignificant spare capacity. The main approach to measuring spare capacity is to compare the currentunemployment rate with an estimate of the unemployment rate associated with full employment, which isthe rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation. The Bank's estimate of thisunemployment rate had declined gradually over recent years, to be around 4½ per centcurrently.", "Members noted the significant uncertainty around modelled estimates of the unemployment rate consistentwith full employment. They also discussed other measures of spare capacity, including underemployment ofpart-time workers, recognising that the supply side of the labour market had been quite flexible. Strongemployment growth over recent years had encouraged more people to join the labour force, allowing theeconomy to absorb increased activity without generating inflationary pressure. Notwithstanding theuncertainties involved, members revised their assessment of labour market capacity, acknowledging theaccumulation of evidence that there was now more capacity for the labour market to absorb additionallabour demand before inflation concerns would emerge."], "Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that escalating tradedisputes had led to a rise in volatility in global financial markets over preceding weeks, most notablyin equity markets. Nevertheless, with central banks expected to maintain expansionary policy settingsand risk premiums generally low, global financial conditions remained accommodative.", "The escalation in the trade dispute between the United States and China had resulted in declines inglobal equity markets. The fall in equity prices had been particularly sharp in China, but substantialdeclines had also been seen in the United States as well as in a range of other advanced economies.Members observed that the declines in equity prices had been largest for sectors more directly exposedto the announced and prospective tariff changes and/or deriving a larger share of revenue frominternational trade.", "By contrast, Australian equity prices were little changed at close to their highest level in a decade.Members noted that a sharp increase in Australian banks' share prices, following the federalelection, had partly offset a recent decline in resource stocks in the context of escalating tradetensions.", "Members noted that there had been only a modest tightening in financial conditions in emerging markets,including in Mexico, where trade tensions with the United States had recently resurfaced. Equity priceshad declined and sovereign credit spreads had widened somewhat, and there had been modest outflows frombond and equity funds in emerging markets. Currencies of emerging market economies had also generallydepreciated a little, although there had mostly been little change in yields on government bondsdenominated in local currencies.", "In the advanced economies, there had been some widening in yield spreads between corporate andsovereign debt, particularly for corporations rated below investment grade. Members observed thatfinancing costs for corporations remained low nonetheless, with government bond yields having declinedfurther over the preceding month, in some cases to historic lows. This had partly reflected a shift downin market participants' expectations of future policy interest rates in several advancedeconomies, including Australia, in an environment of ongoing trade tensions and subdued inflation. Inthe cases of the United States, Canada and New Zealand, members noted that market pricing implied alowering of policy rates in the period ahead, although central banks in these economies had notindicated that a near-term change in policy rates was in prospect.", "Volatility in foreign exchange markets had generally remained low, although the Japanese yen hadappreciated over recent weeks, as tends to be the case in periods of increased uncertainty. There hadbeen a moderate depreciation of the Chinese renminbi over the preceding month.", "Members noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated a little over preceding months, remainingaround the lower end of its narrow range of the preceding few years. Members also noted that while thestrength in commodity prices had supported the exchange rate, the decline in Australian government bondyields relative to those in the major markets over 2019 had worked in the opposite direction. Long-termgovernment bond yields in Australia remained noticeably below those in the United States, although thisgap had narrowed a little recently as market participants' expectations for the future path ofthe US federal funds rate were revised sharply lower.", "Housing credit growth had stabilised in recent months, having slowed substantially over the precedingyear. Growth in housing lending to owner-occupiers was running at around 4½ per cent insix-month-ended annualised terms, while the rate of growth in housing lending to investors had beenclose to zero since early 2019. Although standard variable reference rates for housing loans hadincreased since mid 2018, the average rate paid on outstanding loans had been little changed sincethen, as banks had continued to compete for new borrowers by offering materially lower rates on newloans. Borrowers shifting from interest-only to principal-and-interest loans had also put downwardpressure on average outstanding mortgage rates.", "Members were briefed on the changes proposed by APRA to its requirement that banks determine theborrowing capacity of loan applicants using a specified minimum interest rate. Members observed that theproposed changes would be likely to result in a modest increase in borrowing capacity for those withlower interest rate loans, typically owner-occupiers and borrowers with principal-and-interest loans.However, some borrowers facing higher-than-average interest rates would not see an increase in theirborrowing capacity. Members observed that such a change to serviceability assessments would mean thatany reduction in actual interest rates paid would increase households' borrowing capacity alittle. This would be in addition to the positive effect on the cash flow of the household sectoroverall.", "The pace of growth in business lending had slowed in recent months, with lending to large businessescontinuing to be the sole source of growth. Lending to small businesses had declined over the precedingyear. Members noted that the stricter verification of income and expenses required for consumer lendingwas also being applied to many small businesses.", "Members noted that financing conditions for both financial and non-financial corporations were highlyfavourable, with Australian bond yields at historic lows. Yields on residential mortgage-backedsecurities were also at low levels, having declined in line with the one-month bank bill swap rate(BBSW), which is the reference rate for these securities. Members observed that the increase in BBSW andother short-term money market rates in 2018 had been fully unwound. As a result, the major banks'debt funding costs were now at a historic low. The major banks' retail deposit rates were alsohistorically low, with deposit rates having continued to edge lower. The average interest rate paid onretail deposits by banks was slightly below the cash rate, although only a small share of deposits byvalue received a rate below 0.5 per cent (predominantly deposits on transactionaccounts).", "Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate target was expected to be lowered by 25 basispoints at the present meeting, with a further 25 basis point reduction expected later in theyear."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that the outlook for the global economyremained reasonable, although the risks from the international trade disputes had increased. Membersnoted that the associated uncertainty had been affecting investment intentions in a number of economiesand that international trade remained weak. At the same time, the Chinese authorities had continued toprovide targeted stimulus to support economic growth, and global financial conditions remained veryaccommodative. In most advanced economies, labour markets had remained tight and wages growth had pickedup, while inflation had remained subdued.", "Members observed that the outlook for the Australian economy also remained reasonable, with thesustained low level of interest rates continuing to support economic activity. A pick-up in growth inhousehold disposable income, continued investment in infrastructure and a renewed expansion in theresources sector were expected to contribute to growth in output over coming years. The unemploymentrate was expected to decline a little towards the end of the forecast period, and underlying inflationwas expected to pick up gradually, to be at the lower end of the target range in the next couple ofyears. Members noted that this outlook was based on the usual technical assumption that the cash ratefollowed the path implied by market pricing, which suggested interest rates would be lower in the periodahead.", "The most recent data on labour market conditions had shown that, despite ongoing strong growth inemployment, the unemployment rate had not declined any further in the preceding six months and had edgedup in the most recent two months. Reasonably strong demand for labour had been met partly by a rise inlabour force participation. Members observed that this increased flexibility on the supply side of thelabour market, together with ongoing subdued growth in wages and inflation, suggested that sparecapacity was likely to remain in the labour market for some time. While wages growth had picked up froma year earlier, it had remained subdued and recent data suggested the pick-up was only very gradual.Together, these data suggested that the Australian economy could sustain a lower rate of unemploymentthan previously estimated, while achieving inflation consistent with the target.", "Members observed that underlying inflation had been below the 2–3 per cent targetrange for three years and that the lower-than-expected March quarter inflation data – at1½ per cent in underlying terms – had pointed to ongoing subdued inflationarypressures. In part, this reflected continued slow growth in wages. Members also observed thatcompetition in retailing, very weak growth in rents in the context of the housing market adjustment andgovernment initiatives to reduce cost-of-living pressures had been dampening inflation pressures. Thesefactors were likely to continue for some time. Members recognised that Australia's flexibleinflation targeting framework did not require inflation to be within the target range at all times,which allows the Board to set monetary policy so as best to achieve the Bank's broad objectives.However, they also agreed that the inflation target plays an important role as a strong medium-termanchor for inflation expectations, to help deliver low and stable inflation, which in turn supportssustainable growth in employment and incomes.", "In these circumstances, members agreed that further improvement in the labour market would be requiredfor wages growth and inflation to rise to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.Moreover, while the Bank's central forecast scenario for growth and inflation was unchanged, theaccumulation of data on inflation and labour market conditions over recent months had led members torevise their assessment of the extent of inflationary pressure in the economy and, relatedly, the extentof spare capacity in the Australian labour market.", "Given these considerations, members considered the case for a reduction in the cash rate at the currentmeeting. A lower level of interest rates would support growth in the economy, thereby reducingunemployment and contributing to inflation rising to a level consistent with the target.", "Members recognised that, in the current environment, the main channels through which lower interestrates would support the economy were a lower value of the exchange rate, reduced borrowing rates forbusinesses, and lower required interest payments on borrowing by households, freeing up cash for otherexpenditure. Although households are net borrowers in aggregate, members recognised that there are manyindividual households that are net savers and whose interest income would be reduced by lower interestrates. Carefully considering these different effects, members judged that a lower level of interestrates was likely to support growth in employment and incomes, and promote stronger overall economicconditions.", "Members also considered the risks associated with a lower level of interest rates in the period ahead.Given the high level of household debt, the adjustment under way in housing markets and the tighteningin lending practices, members judged that a decline in interest rates was unlikely to encourage amaterial pick-up in borrowing by households that would add to medium-term risks in the economy. Memberscontinued to recognise that there were risks to the forecasts for growth and inflation in bothdirections. However, given the extent of spare capacity in the economy and the subdued inflationarypressures, they judged there was a low likelihood of a decline in interest rates resulting in anunexpectedly strong pick-up in inflation. Members also observed that a lower level of interest rateswould stimulate activity and thereby improve the resilience of the Australian economy to any futureadverse shocks.", "Taking into account all the available information, the Board decided that it was appropriate to lowerthe cash rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. A lower level of the cash rate would assist inreducing spare capacity in the labour market, providing more Australians with jobs and greaterconfidence that inflation will return to be comfortably within the medium-term target range in theperiod ahead. Given the amount of spare capacity in the labour market and the economy more broadly,members agreed that it was more likely than not that a further easing in monetary policy would beappropriate in the period ahead. They also recognised, however, that lower interest rates were not theonly policy option available to assist in lowering the rate of unemployment, consistent with themedium-term inflation target. Members agreed that, in assessing whether further monetary easing wasappropriate, developments in the labour market would be particularly important."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent, effective 5 June."]}},

Near-term indicators relating to trade, manufacturing andinvestment had remained subdued, although consumption growth had been relatively resilient, supported bystrong labour market conditions especially in the advanced economies. Despite wages growth havinggenerally trended higher over the preceding few years, inflation had remained below target in a range ofeconomies.", "Growth in major trading partners was expected to slow a little in 2019 and 2020. This outlook had beenrevised down a little since the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> in light of the escalationof the US–China trade and technology disputes and the related weakness in indicators ofinvestment. Members noted the recent announcement by the US administration of a 10 per centtariff to be imposed on a further US$300 billion of Chinese exports to the United States. Furtherescalation presented a downside risk to the outlook, particularly if heightened uncertainty weighedfurther on business investment. Members noted that investment intentions had already eased significantlyin a number of economies, including the United States and the euro area, and investment had fallen in anumber of economies with a high exposure to international trade, including South Korea.", "In China, a range of activity indicators suggested that domestic economic conditions had slowed furtherin the June quarter. Further monetary and fiscal stimulus measures had also been announced. Fiscalsupport had encouraged investment in infrastructure, while residential construction had continued togrow relatively strongly, which in turn had supported steel production. The outlook for the Chineseeconomy had been revised lower, largely because of the ongoing US–China trade and technologydisputes. Uncertainty about how these disputes would play out and how effective domestic policy measureswould be in supporting Chinese demand continued to be an important consideration for the global growthoutlook and, from an Australian perspective, the future demand for steel and bulk commodities.", "The US–China disputes and the slowing in Chinese domestic demand had affected export andinvestment growth in the east Asian region. However, exports to the United States had increased for someeconomies in the region, including Vietnam, as a result of trade diversion. By contrast, growth inconsumption in the east Asian region had generally remained more resilient. Growth in output in Indiahad slowed and the outlook was weaker than previously forecast, largely because there had been lessfiscal support and trade tensions with the United States were emerging.", "In the major advanced economies, risks to the outlook remained tilted to the downside, reflecting thetrade disputes. The US economy had continued to grow relatively strongly into the June quarter. This wasdespite the effects of the trade dispute on the manufacturing sector and on business investment moregenerally, partly because tight labour markets had supported strong consumption growth. Members notedthat the most recent round of tariff announcements would affect US imports of consumption goods fromChina and could boost US consumer prices to some extent. Further slowing in investment seemed likely asthe effect of earlier fiscal stimulus waned and the uncertainty related to the trade and technologydisputes persisted.", "Weaker global trade and greater uncertainty had also affected growth in output in the euro area. Growthin Japan was expected to be boosted temporarily by spending brought forward ahead of an increase in theconsumption tax in October, although weaker external demand had weighed on export growth.", "Commodity prices had generally fallen since the previous meeting, partly in response to the escalationof trade tensions in early August. After more than doubling in the first half of 2019, iron ore priceshad declined to be below US$100 per tonne. Coal and oil prices had also declined over the previousmonth. Rural commodity prices had been little changed. Members noted that the terms of trade forAustralia in the June quarter had been higher than expected."], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that GDP growth was expected to have been firmer in theJune quarter after three weak quarters. This was partly because resource exports had recovered fromearlier supply disruptions and mining investment was likely to be less of a drag on growth. Partialindicators suggested that consumption growth had remained subdued in the June quarter; the volume ofretail sales had been subdued and sales of new cars had declined. While dwelling investment was expectedto have declined further in the June quarter, public demand and non-mining business investment wereexpected to have continued to support growth.", "Members observed that the lower near-term GDP growth forecast mostly reflected the fact thatconsumption growth had been weaker than expected over recent quarters. Members noted that consumptiongrowth per capita had been particularly weak recently. The forecast for GDP growth over 2019 had beenlowered to 2½ per cent. Growth was expected to pick up to 2¾ per cent over2020 and to around 3 per cent over 2021. This was supported by a range of factors, includinglower interest rates, tax measures, signs of an earlier-than-expected stabilisation in some establishedhousing markets, the lower exchange rate, the infrastructure pipeline and a pick-up in activity in themining sector.", "Members noted that although the outlook for consumption remained uncertain, the risks around theoutlook were more balanced than they had been for some time. The low- and middle-income tax offset wasexpected to boost income growth, with a surge in the lodgement of tax returns since the end of June. Inaddition, signs of a recovery in some established housing markets suggested that the dampening effect ofdeclining housing prices on consumption could dissipate earlier than had previously been assumed.", "The evidence that conditions in housing markets were showing signs of a turnaround had strengthened inJuly. In Sydney and Melbourne, housing prices had increased, housing turnover appeared to have reached atrough and auction clearance rates had risen further. Outside the two largest cities, housing marketconditions had shown tentative signs of improvement; prices had risen in Brisbane, while the pace ofdecline had slowed in Perth. Rental vacancies had been low in most cities except in Sydney, where theyhad risen further as new apartments were added to the rental stock.", "Members observed that it could take some time for the stabilisation of conditions in the establishedhousing market to translate into a pick-up in construction activity. Indeed, leading indicatorssuggested that dwelling investment was likely to decline further in the near term. Residential buildingapprovals had declined further over May and June and were around their lowest levels in six years.Timely information from liaison contacts suggested that increased buyer interest had yet to translateinto more housing sales. However, members noted that signs of a turnaround in housing markets suggestedthere were some upside risks to dwelling investment later in the forecast period, particularly given theexpected strength in population growth.", "Forward-looking indicators for business investment had been mixed. Survey measures of businessconditions had been less positive than a year earlier, especially in the retail and transport sectors,but generally had remained around average. By contrast, non-residential building approvals had trendedup in recent months and the pipeline of work under way was already quite high. There was also a largepipeline of private sector projects to build transport and renewable energy infrastructure, which wasexpected to support non-mining business investment.", "Although mining investment had declined in the March quarter as large liquefied natural gas (LNG)projects approached completion, the medium-term outlook for mining investment had remained positive. Anumber of projects had been committed and others were under consideration, which would add to investmentin coming years if they went ahead. Members noted that the outlook for mining investment had not beenaffected by the recent elevated levels of iron ore prices. However, they observed that higher iron oreprices would add to government taxation revenues and boost household income and wealth through dividendsand the effect on share prices. At the margin, this could provide greater impetus to spending thancurrently assumed.", "Resource exports had picked up during the June quarter as some supply disruptions to iron ore had beenresolved and LNG production had increased further. Resource exports were expected to contribute togrowth over the forecast period and the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar was expected tosupport further growth in service and manufacturing exports.", "Members noted that recent labour market data had been mixed. The unemployment rate had remained at5.2 per cent for the third consecutive month, which was higher than had been expected in May.However, growth in employment had continued to exceed growth in the working-age population in the Junequarter and had been stronger than forecast in May. As a result, the employment-to-population ratio andthe participation rate had remained around record highs. Over the previous year, there had been aparticularly notable increase in the participation rates of women aged between 25 and 54 yearsand workers aged 65 years and over. Members noted that the increase in participation by olderworkers had more than offset any tendency for the ageing of the population to reduce aggregateparticipation in the labour force. Members discussed some of the factors that could be contributing tothese trends, including slow income growth, improvements in health and greater flexibility in the labourmarket.", "Leading indicators implied a moderation in employment growth over the following six months: jobvacancies had declined slightly over the three months to May (but remained high as a share of the labourforce) and firms' near-term hiring intentions had moderated, to be just above their long-runaverage. The unemployment rate forecast had been revised higher, with the unemployment rate expected toremain around 5¼ per cent for some time before declining to about 5 per cent asgrowth in output picked up.", "Members noted that the outlook for the labour market was one of the key uncertainties for theforecasts, with implications for growth in wages, household income and consumption. The outlook forwages growth had been revised a little lower because the outlook for the labour market suggested thatthere would be more spare capacity than previously thought. Private sector wages growth was expected topick up only modestly, while public sector wages growth would be contained by government caps on wageincreases. Members observed that the outlook for household consumption spending could be weaker ifhouseholds expected low income growth to persist for longer.", "Members noted that the June quarter CPI had been largely as expected. Trimmed mean inflation hadincreased a little to 0.4 per cent in the June quarter, but had remained at1.6 per cent over the preceding year, consistent with the forecast in May. Headline inflationhad been 0.7 per cent (seasonally adjusted), partly because fuel prices had increased byaround 10 per cent in the June quarter; over the year, headline inflation had also been1.6 per cent. Overall, members noted that there had been few signs in the June quarter CPInumbers of inflationary pressures emerging.", "Inflation in market-based services had remained steady, which was consistent with a lack of wagepressures in the economy. Inflation in the housing-related components of the CPI had been aroundhistorical lows. New dwelling prices had declined again in the June quarter, reflecting the use of bonusoffers and purchase incentives by developers to counter the weak housing conditions. Rent inflation hadbeen flat in the quarter in aggregate, but had fallen noticeably in Sydney, consistent with the risingvacancy rate; rent deflation had eased in Perth and had been steady in most other cities. Members notedthat low inflation in new dwelling costs and rents, which represent around one-sixth of the CPI basket,was likely to persist in the near term.", "There had been an increase in inflation for retail items because there had been some pass-through ofthe exchange rate depreciation and the drought had boosted certain food prices. These effects wereexpected to dissipate if there was no further exchange rate depreciation, as is usually assumed in theforecasts, and once normal seasonal conditions returned. Inflation in the prices of administered itemsand utilities had remained well below typical increases recorded a few years earlier.", "Inflation was expected to pick up more gradually than previously forecast because of subdued wageoutcomes and the evidence of spare capacity in the economy. The experience of other economies suggestedthat any pick-up in wages growth might take longer to translate into inflation than in the past.Underlying inflation and headline inflation were both expected to pick up to be a little above2 per cent over 2021, as spare capacity in the labour market declined and as growth increasedto run above potential. Members noted that there were downside risks to some individual CPI components.In the near term, electricity prices could grow at a below-average pace or even fall, and governmentcost-of-living initiatives could weigh on other items in the CPI basket. Inflation rates for both newdwelling prices and rents were also expected to remain low in the near term, but were more uncertaintowards the end of the forecast period."], "Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that central banks in the majoreconomies had eased, or were expected to ease, policy settings in response to downside risks to growthand subdued inflation outcomes. Financial market volatility had increased recently from low levels, inresponse to the escalation of the trade and technology disputes between the United States andChina.", "The US Federal Reserve lowered its policy rate target by 25 basis points in July. Market pricingsuggested that the federal funds rate was expected to decline by a further 100 basis points or soover the following year. The Federal Reserve noted that the US labour market had remained strong.However, it was perceived by members of the Federal Open Market Committee that there was room for someeasing of monetary policy given the implications of global developments for the US economic outlook andsubdued inflation pressures. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank (ECB) had foreshadowed additionalmonetary stimulus unless the outlook for inflation in the euro area improved. The ECB indicated that itcould expand its bond-buying program, among other measures, and market pricing suggested that the ECBwas likely to reduce its policy rate over the following months. Market participants were also expectingthe Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further in the period ahead.", "In response to the shift in the outlook for monetary policy, long-term interest rates had declined tohistorical lows in several markets, including in Australia. Yields on government bonds were negativefor a number of European sovereigns and Japan. In addition, corporate bond spreads were low globally,with a growing portion of corporate debt in the euro area trading at yields below zero. Membersdiscussed the implications of the low level of bond yields for corporate balance sheets andinvestment.", "Global equity markets had declined sharply prior to the meeting, in response to the recent escalationof the trade and technology disputes. Nevertheless, equity market indices were still well above theirlevels earlier in the year, supported by lower bond yields and expectations that earnings growth wouldbe reasonable. During July, equity market indices in the United States and Australia had reached recordhigh levels.", "In foreign exchange markets, prior to the meeting there had been an increase in volatility, from verylow levels, in response to the escalation of the trade and technology disputes. In particular, the yenhad appreciated against the US dollar while the Chinese yuan had depreciated. Members took note ofthe market commentary that the US and Japanese authorities could intervene in an effort to lower thevalue of their currencies. The Australian dollar had depreciated in recent times to be at its lowestlevel in many years.", "In Australia, the reduction in variable mortgage rates had been broadly consistent with the reductionin the cash rate in June and July. The degree of pass-through of the cash rate reductions was alsocomparable to that observed over the preceding decade. Housing credit growth had declined in June, forboth owner-occupiers and investors. At the same time, however, loan approvals had picked up in June,which for investors was the first sizeable increase for some time. This was consistent with otherindicators suggesting that the housing market had stabilised over recent months. However, loanapprovals to property developers had remained subdued. Members also noted that access to finance forsmall businesses continued to be tight.", "Banks' debt funding costs and borrowing rates for households and businesses were athistorically low levels. Rates in short-term money markets, bank bond yields and deposit rates had alldeclined to historically low levels. The proportion of bank deposits that attract no interest hadincreased marginally to be just under 10 per cent. Despite the low level of funding costs,banks' bond issuance remained subdued. This reflected slow credit growth, along with the banksincreasing their issuance of hybrid securities to fulfil new regulatory capital requirements. Membersalso noted that mergers and acquisitions activity had not been especially high, despite fundingconditions being very accommodative for large businesses.", "Market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged in August. A 25 basispoints reduction had been fully priced in by November 2019, with a further 25 basis pointsreduction expected in 2020. The low level of bond yields implied that the cash rate was expected toremain very low for several years.", "Members reviewed the experience of other advanced economies with unconventional monetary policymeasures over the preceding decade. These measures comprised: very low and negative policy interestrates; explicit forward guidance; lowering longer-term risk-free rates by purchasing governmentsecurities; providing longer-term funding to banks to support credit creation; purchasing private sectorassets; and foreign exchange intervention. Members considered the key lessons from the internationalexperience, noting that a full evaluation could not be undertaken as many of these measures were yet tobe unwound. One key lesson was that the effectiveness of these measures depended upon the specificcircumstances facing each economy and the nature of its financial system. Some measures had beensuccessful in reducing government bond yields, which had flowed through to lower interest rates forprivate borrowers. Other measures had been effective in addressing dislocations in credit supply.Members noted that a package of measures tended to be more effective than measures implemented inisolation. Finally, it was important for the central bank to communicate clearly and consistently aboutthese measures."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["Turning to the policy decision, members observed that the escalation of the trade and technologydisputes had increased the downside risks to the global growth outlook, although the central forecastwas still for reasonable growth. Uncertainty around trade policy had already had a negative effect oninvestment in many economies. Members noted that, against this backdrop, the low inflation outcomes inmany economies provided central banks with scope to ease monetary policy further if required. Indeed, anumber of central banks had reduced interest rates this year and further monetary easing was widelyexpected. In China, the authorities had taken steps to support economic growth, while continuing toaddress risks in the financial system.", "Overall, global financial conditions remained accommodative. Long-term government bond yields haddeclined further and were at record lows in many economies, including Australia. Borrowing rates forboth households and businesses were also at historically low levels and there was strong competition forborrowers of high credit quality. Despite this, demand for housing credit, particularly from investors,remained subdued, while access to credit for some types of borrowers, especially small businesses,remained tight. The Australian dollar had depreciated to its lowest level in recent times.", "Domestically, growth had been lower than expected in the first half of 2019. Looking forward, growthwas expected to strengthen gradually, to 2¾ per cent over 2020 and to around3 per cent over 2021. This outlook was supported by a number of developments, including lowerinterest rates, higher growth in household income (including from the recent tax cuts), the depreciationof the Australian dollar, a positive outlook for investment in the resources sector, some stabilisationof the housing market and ongoing high levels of investment in infrastructure. Overall, the domesticrisks to the forecast for output growth appeared to be tilted to the downside in the near term, but weremore balanced later in the forecast period.", "Employment growth had been stronger than expected and labour force participation had increased to arecord high. However, the unemployment rate had increased and there appeared to have been more sparecapacity in the labour market than previously appreciated, although there was uncertainty around theextent of this. The unemployment rate was expected to decline to around 5 per cent over thefollowing couple of years, consistent with the gradual pick-up in GDP growth. Wages growth had beensubdued and there were few signs of wage pressures building in the economy. Combined with thereassessment of spare capacity in the labour market, this had led to a more subdued outlook for wagesgrowth than three months earlier.", "In the June quarter, inflation had been broadly as expected at 1.6 per cent. Members notedthat inflation had averaged a little below 2 per cent for a number of years. In the near term,there were few signs of inflationary pressures building, but, over time, inflation was expected toincrease gradually to be a little under 2 per cent over 2020 and a little above2 per cent over 2021.", "Based on the information available and the central scenario that was presented, members judged itreasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates would be required in Australia tomake sustained progress towards full employment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflationtarget. Having eased monetary policy at the previous two meetings, the Board judged it appropriate toassess developments in the global and domestic economies before considering further change to thesetting of monetary policy. Members would consider a further easing of monetary policy if theaccumulation of additional evidence suggested this was needed to support sustainable growth in theeconomy and the achievement of the inflation target over time."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.00 per cent."]}},

Overall, labour market conditions remainedtight but inflation remained below central banks' targets.", "Growth in Australia's major trading partners was forecast to be around 3½ per centin 2019 and 2020. These forecasts had been revised down a little since the August meeting, partlybecause the US–China trade and technology disputes had escalated over the previous three months.Members noted that the implications of slower global growth for the Australian economy would depend onits composition; over the previous year or so, strength in steel-intensive activity in China hadsupported demand for Australian exports despite Chinese growth slowing overall.", "The risks to the global growth forecasts were still tilted to the downside.

The outlook for global growth wasbeing supported by accommodative financial conditions.", "In the advanced economies, GDP growth had slowed over the preceding year or so and was forecast to slowa little further to be around, or somewhat below, trend in 2020. In the United States, GDP growth was ator above trend; consumption growth had been resilient and residential construction activity had pickedup, although business investment had declined. In the euro area, subdued growth had reflected weakexternal demand and weak production in the automotive industry. Members noted that the introduction ofnew emissions testing and weak global demand for passenger vehicles had contributed to the decline inexports and car production in the euro area since mid 2018. In Japan, growth was expected to slowfrom an above-trend pace following an increase in the consumption tax in October. The Japanese economywas also facing slowing external demand, particularly from other parts of Asia.", "In east Asia, GDP growth had been subdued in the September quarter, most notably in the moreexport-oriented economies, given their close integration into global supply chains. Members noted thatweak global demand for memory circuits had dampened growth in South Korea and Singapore, while politicalunrest had contributed to a fall in output in Hong Kong. Growth in output had been relatively resilientin the less export-oriented economies. Some governments in the region had offered incentives forproduction to relocate from China in response to the trade disputes. There had been further signs ofweakness in the Indian economy, mostly unrelated to the slowing in global trade, which authorities hadtried to offset through both monetary and fiscal stimulus.", "In China, GDP had increased at an annual rate of 6 per cent in the September quarter, largelyas expected, with slower growth in domestic demand. Members noted that growth in nominal GDP had alsoslowed and that this had implications for debt-servicing capacity. Bilateral trade with the UnitedStates had contracted further, but, overall, external demand had been steadier and net exports had beenpositive for Chinese growth more recently. Policy measures had continued to support growth and had beentilted towards steel-intensive activities. This had supported Chinese steel production and, in turn,demand for Australian bulk commodities. There remained ongoing uncertainty about how these policymeasures and trade tensions with the United States would affect growth in China. As had been the casefor some time, the mix of policy measures was also an important consideration for how Australia'sexports and terms of trade might be affected.", "Movements in commodity prices had been mixed since the previous meeting. Iron ore prices had declinedin response to expectations of lower near-term demand. Oil, coal and base metals prices had increased alittle in October. Overall, the terms of trade for the September quarter had been revised a littlehigher.

Consumer sentiment had fallen to below-average levelsover recent months.", "Growth in consumption was expected to increase over the forecast period, supported by some recovery ingrowth in household income and the turnaround in prices in the established housing market. Growth inhousehold disposable income was forecast to increase, because labour market conditions were expected tocontinue to support labour income and the recent monetary policy easing and tax offsets would lowerhousehold interest and tax payments. In the near term, however, forecast growth in household income hadbeen revised slightly lower, partly to reflect the effects of the drought on farm incomes and thedownturn in housing construction on related businesses, as well as continuing evidence of strong taxcollections.

Liaison with industryparticipants suggested that the recent improvement in housing market conditions had not yet translatedinto stronger sales for new housing. A larger-than-expected contraction in dwelling investment coulddelay the gradual improvement in GDP growth. Members noted that the recent strengthening in housingmarket conditions would support building activity in time. The lagged response to higher housing pricesand a period of low building activity had raised the likelihood that dwelling investment would bestronger in the medium term than currently expected.", "Recent indicators pointed to ongoing support for non-residential construction activity over thefollowing year or so. Non-residential building approvals had increased in recent months and the pipelineof work for both non-residential building and private infrastructure had remained at a high level.Business conditions had been around average since the beginning of the year. Mining-related activity wasexpected to increase over the forecast period and it was possible that mining investment could bestronger than expected towards the end of the forecast period.

New dwellingprices had declined for the third consecutive quarter. Rent inflation had remained low because of thestrong supply of rental housing, particularly in Sydney. Electricity prices had fallen as a result ofregulatory changes in the quarter. Overall, inflation in non-tradable items had been steady. Incontrast, tradable inflation (excluding volatile items) had picked up in the quarter, reflectingcontinued pass-through of the earlier exchange rate depreciation to retail prices; the prices ofconsumer durables had risen over the previous four quarters, following a decade of declining prices.Grocery price inflation had also picked up, driven by the ongoing effect of the drought on food prices.Members noted that meat prices had also been supported by strong demand from China to replace lostdomestic pork production as a result of African swine flu and were likely to remain high for some timeafter the drought breaks, given that it would take time to rebuild herds.", "Underlying and headline inflation were expected to increase to around 2 per cent by the endof 2021.

Utilities price inflation was expected to be belowaverage over the following few years and could be lower than forecast as more renewable energy capacitycomes on line. New dwelling inflation was expected to remain subdued until construction activityrecovers later in the forecast period. Rent inflation was expected to increase from its recent low rategiven that ongoing population growth was expected to be higher than growth in the housing stock.", "Members noted that the risks to the wage and price inflation forecasts were balanced. Wages couldincrease more quickly than forecast if the pick-up in output growth erodes spare capacity more quicklythan anticipated. However, an extended period of low wages growth and inflation could mean thatwage-setting norms would be slow to move higher. Members observed that a further gradual lift in wagesgrowth would be needed for inflation to be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent targetrange.", "Members considered a detailed review of how the economy had evolved over the preceding year relative tothe Bank's forecasts for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation. Over the year since the November2018 forecasts, GDP growth had been much weaker than expected. Inflation had also been lower thanforecast. The extent and breadth of the spillovers from the housing downturn – particularly forconsumption, household income, dwelling investment and inflation – had been an important driverof these outcomes. These spillovers had mostly been identified at the time as downside risks to theforecasts, but their extent had been considerably larger than expected. Despite the slower-than-expectedgrowth in output, there had been sustained strength in employment growth, which had been met withgreater labour force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate had been only marginally higherthan forecast and there had been little upward pressure on wages."], "Financial Markets": ["Members noted that global financial conditions remained accommodative.

However, it also noted that the US economycontinued to perform solidly and that it would take a material change in the outlook for the FederalReserve to adjust policy settings further. After announcing a broad-based stimulus package inSeptember, the European Central Bank left policy settings unchanged at its October meeting, but statedthat it was prepared to ease policy further if necessary. The People's Bank of China continued toemploy a range of targeted measures to maintain accommodative financing conditions in support ofeconomic activity, including further cuts to banks' required reserve ratios.", "During October, government bond yields had increased modestly in a wide range of economies, includingAustralia. The increase followed positive developments in the US–China disputes and Brexitnegotiations, and was associated with the scaling back of expectations for further monetary policystimulus. Nevertheless, government bond yields remained close to the very low levels reached in themiddle of the year.", "Financing conditions for corporations remained accommodative. Globally, equity prices had increased,and the US market was at a record high. Spreads on corporate bonds were low. In Australia, growth inbusiness debt had slowed, reflecting softer demand for funding from large businesses, while creditconditions for small and medium-sized businesses remained tight.", "The US dollar and Japanese yen had depreciated a little over October (after having appreciatedover the previous few years) in response to the easing in concerns about global downside risks. Afterdepreciating over much of 2019, the Chinese renminbi had appreciated somewhat in recent times. TheAustralian dollar had appreciated slightly in October, but remained at the lower end of its range overrecent times.", "In Australia, banks' funding costs had declined following the reductions in the cash rate, whichhad been reflected in short-term money market rates and deposit rates over recent months. Membersdiscussed the range of pricing on deposits. While close to a quarter of deposits were estimated to beearning interest at rates between 0 and 50 basis points, most deposits earned interest atrates over 1 per cent. Following the cumulative 75 basis point reduction in the cashrate this year, banks were estimated to have lowered the interest rates on at-call retail deposits byan average of 60 to 70 basis points.", "Borrowing rates for households and businesses were at historic lows. A large share of the recentmonetary policy easing had been passed through to mortgage rates paid by households. After passingthrough most of the June and July cash rate cuts to standard variable mortgage rates (SVRs), financialinstitutions had passed through less of the October rate cut, bringing the total reduction in SVRssince June to around 60 basis points. Strong competition for high-quality borrowers had led torates for new and refinanced loans being lower than for existing loans. In addition, borrowers werecontinuing to switch from interest-only loans to lower-rate principal-and-interest loans. This meantthat average outstanding mortgage rates had declined by around 65 basis points since the middle ofthe year. This process was expected to continue.", "Consistent with the improvements in some housing markets, housing loan approvals had risen stronglysince May, driven largely by approvals to owner-occupiers. Members noted that there was strongcompetition for borrowers of high credit quality. Despite this, the pace of growth in housing creditfor owner-occupiers had picked up only slightly, while the stock of housing credit for investors hadcontinued to decline a little. This implied that the increase in new loans over recent months had beenaccompanied by faster repayment of existing loans, as usually occurs in the months immediatelyfollowing an interest rate reduction.", "Financial market pricing implied that expectations for a further reduction in the cash rate had beenscaled back since the previous meeting, with some chance of a 25 basis point reduction around themiddle of 2020."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["Turning to the policy decision, members observed that while the outlook for the global economy remainedreasonable, the risks continued to be tilted to the downside.

The Australian dollar was at the lower end of its range overrecent times.", "The outlook for the Australian economy was little changed since August. After a soft period in thesecond half of 2018, GDP growth had picked up a little in the first half of 2019 and it appeared that agentle turning point had been reached. Looking forward, growth was expected to strengthen gradually to2¾ per cent over 2020 and around 3 per cent over 2021. This outlook wasexpected to be supported by accommodative monetary policy, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending oninfrastructure, the upswing in housing prices in some markets and a pick-up in mining investment. Animportant domestic uncertainty continued to be the outlook for consumption, with the sustained period ofonly modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending.", "Employment had continued to grow strongly and had been matched by strong growth in labour supply. Theunemployment rate had remained steady at around 5¼ per cent and was expected to declineonly gradually. Spare capacity was likely to remain in the labour market for some years. Wages growthhad remained subdued and was expected to remain at around its current rate for some time yet. Membersagreed that a further gradual lift in wages growth would be a welcome development and was needed forinflation to be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target range.", "In the September quarter, inflation had been broadly as expected at 1.7 per cent over theyear. Inflationary pressures had remained subdued, held down by very low housing-related prices and slowgrowth in labour costs and administered prices. Over time, inflation was expected to increase graduallyin response to some tightening in labour market conditions, to be close to 2 per cent in 2020and 2021.", "Given this outlook, members considered how best to respond.", "The Board agreed that a case could be made to ease monetary policy at this meeting, but that the mostappropriate approach would be to maintain the current stance of monetary policy and to make another fullassessment once more evidence of the effects of the earlier monetary easing had become available. Globalfinancial markets were signalling a decline in pessimism, which, if sustained, could lead to better thanexpected outcomes for the global economy. The significant easing of monetary policy in Australia sincethe middle of the year was supporting employment and income growth and a gradual return of inflation tothe medium-term target range. The established housing market was picking up, which would have positivespillovers for the broader economy, although the size of these spillovers was uncertain. Furtherevidence on spending by households was required before drawing a conclusion on the effects of the taxcuts and low interest rates. Having already delivered a substantial monetary stimulus in recent months,there was a case to wait and assess the effects of this stimulus, especially given the long and variablelags.", "In reaching this conclusion, members reviewed the case for a further reduction at the present meeting.This case largely rested on only gradual progress having been made towards the Bank's goals. Whilemembers judged that lower interest rates were supporting the economy through the usual transmissionchannels (including a lower exchange rate, higher asset prices and higher cash flows for borrowers),they recognised the negative effects of lower interest rates on savers and confidence. They alsodiscussed the possibility that a further reduction in interest rates could have a different effect onconfidence than in the past, when interest rates were at higher levels.", "The Board concluded that the cash rate should be held steady at this meeting. As part of theirdeliberations, members also agreed that it was reasonable to expect that an extended period of lowinterest rates would be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target.The Board would continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and was prepared toease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment andthe achievement of the inflation target over time."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 0.75 per cent."]}},

Business conditions in China in February haddeteriorated by much more than expected and supplier delivery times had increased sharply, indicatingthat there had also been disruptions to supply chains. Retail activity and residential property saleshad been subdued.", "Chinese GDP was expected to rebound later in 2020 as businesses seek to make up lost production and arange of stimulus and tax relief measures from the Chinese Government take effect. Some governmentmeasures, including direct support for manufacturers of medical equipment, were intended to supportcontainment efforts, while others, such as assistance to affected small businesses, were designed toreduce the adverse economic spillovers from COVID-19.", "Given the disruptions to logistics and other transportation in China, forecasts for global oil demandhad been scaled back considerably and oil prices had fallen. This would lead to a decline in headlineinflation globally. The prices of other commodities that tend to be responsive to changes in the outlookfor global demand, including base metals, had also fallen since the start of 2020. Prices for liquefiednatural gas had also declined. Prices of other bulk commodities had been little changed in net terms;iron ore prices had reversed an earlier fall, even as Chinese steel inventories had increased, possiblyin anticipation of a pick-up in demand as economic activity rebounded.", "Growth in other Asian economies was also expected to be lower in the March quarter than previouslythought, reflecting a combination of lower Chinese domestic demand, less Chinese outbound travel andsupply chain disruptions. Early indicators of trade activity in the Asian region in February haddeclined, following a period where trade, industrial production and manufacturing indicators in the moreexport-oriented economies had stabilised, amid signs of stabilisation in the global electronics cycle.Overall, growth in Australia's major trading partners was expected to be around½ percentage point lower in 2020 as a result of COVID-19.", "In the major advanced economies, GDP data for the December quarter had been weaker than expected forJapan and the euro area, while GDP growth in the United States had been relatively resilient. Eventhough employment growth had eased over 2019 in the major advanced economies, unemployment rates hadcontinued to edge lower. Prior to any supply disruptions related to COVID-19, industrial production inthe euro area had continued to decline, particularly in the auto sector. Members noted that, to date,there had been no reports that supply disruptions were contributing to these declines. Some surveymeasures of business conditions in the United States and Japan had deteriorated sharply in February, butinvestment intentions and business sentiment in the United States had been more positive."], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members noted that the December quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting.Quarterly GDP growth was expected to have remained moderate, reflecting ongoing weak growth in householdconsumption and a further decline in dwelling investment. The bushfires over the summer months wereexpected to have affected growth in both the December quarter 2019 and the March quarter 2020, afterwhich recovery efforts were expected to boost growth.", "Members noted that economic activity in the first half of 2020 would be significantly affected by theglobal response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Services exports (which comprise around5 per cent of GDP) were expected to decline by around 10 per cent in the Marchquarter, mainly because of a steep decline in inbound arrivals, including students, particularly fromChina. This effect alone was expected to lower Australian GDP growth by around ½ percentagepoint in the March quarter. Tourism and education exports were expected to remain low in the Junequarter, before returning to their previous levels over the second half of the year as the Chineseeconomy recovers and travel resumes. Members observed that this estimate did not include possibleeffects on domestic activity of supply chain disruptions and public health safety interventions toreduce the likelihood of transmitting COVID-19.", "Information from the capital expenditure (capex) survey and preliminary data on non-residentialconstruction work done suggested that both non-mining and mining investment had decreased in theDecember quarter, led by weakness in building and engineering investment. However, mining firms hadcontinued to expect solid growth in investment over the rest of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span>.The capex survey had also reported firms' investment intentions for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> for the first time. The responses suggested that mining investmentwould increase strongly, consistent with the most recent set of forecasts and the messages from liaisonwith businesses, while non-mining investment was expected to remain subdued.", "National housing price growth had remained robust in February and most capital cities had experiencedat least moderate price increases. The strong growth in housing prices had also encouraged more newresidential listings, albeit from very low levels. Turnover had increased, which, by itself, wasexpected to help support other types of spending. Indicators of activity at the earlier stages ofresidential building had remained consistent with a turnaround in activity in the second half of 2020,especially for detached dwellings. However, data on residential building work done indicated dwellinginvestment had decreased again in the December quarter, driven by a further decline in the constructionof new dwellings.", "Growth in household consumption was expected to have been subdued in the December quarter; retail salesvolumes had increased modestly and there had been further declines in motor vehicle sales in thequarter. A few categories of spending that are most correlated with housing activity had picked up inthe quarter. The drought had continued to affect food prices and the volume of food sales had declinedin the quarter. Members noted that growth in consumption in the first quarter of 2020 could be weakerthan expected if the COVID-19 outbreak induced some households to cancel or defer internationaltravel or disrupted supply chains for imported consumer durables. Although there was considerableuncertainty about the size of the net effect on GDP, it was expected to be small based on the availableevidence.", "Employment had grown by 1.9 per cent over the year to January, which was stronger than growthin the working-age population. However, the unemployment rate had increased to 5.3 per cent,reversing the small decline in the previous month, and the underemployment rate had increased to8.6 per cent. The unemployment rate had been around 5¼ per cent for most of thepreceding year. Members noted that the labour force data could be volatile from month to month and thatit was too soon to know if the modest rise in these measures of spare capacity signalled a change intrend. The wage price index confirmed that growth in wages had remained steady at low rates in theDecember quarter, consistent with information from liaison with businesses, which suggested that wageoutcomes had become increasingly concentrated in the 2–3 per cent range. Wages growthhad slowed a little in some industries. These data and reports from liaison with businesses suggestedthat wages growth was unlikely to pick up in the near future."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that it was becoming increasingly clear thatCOVID-19 would cause major disruption to economic activity around the world. The outbreak hadoccurred in the context of a global economy that was gradually emerging from a soft patch in trade andmanufacturing activity. However, following the outbreak, growth in output in China and other economieswas expected to be significantly lower in the first half of the year, reflecting a combination of lowerdomestic demand, less travel and supply chain disruptions. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 outsideof China, and intensified efforts to contain its further spread, raised the prospect of a broader andmore extended disruption to the global economy. It was too early to tell how persistent these effectswould be and at what point economic activity would rebound. In response to the outbreak, policy measuresto support growth had been announced in several countries, including China. Inflation remained subduedin most advanced economies, despite low unemployment rates.", "Financial markets had been more volatile as market participants assessed the implications of COVID-19,with the prices of many risky assets falling sharply. The uncertainty generated by the outbreak, and anexpectation that central banks would respond with easier policy, had resulted in long-term governmentbond yields falling to historic lows in many countries, including Australia. The Australian dollar haddepreciated to be at its lowest level in more than a decade. Australia's financial markets wereoperating effectively, and the Bank would continue to ensure that the Australian financial system hadsufficient liquidity.", "The advent of COVID-19 around the world was having a significant effect on the Australian economy,particularly in the education, transport and tourism sectors. The uncertainty associated with theoutbreak was also likely to affect household spending and business investment in coming months. As aresult, GDP growth in the March quarter was likely to be noticeably weaker than previously expected, andit was difficult to predict how long it would take for the economy to return to more usual levels ofactivity. Once the disruptions passed, GDP growth was expected to pick up, supported by the low level ofinterest rates, high levels of spending on infrastructure, the lower exchange rate, stronger investmentin the resources sector and recoveries in residential construction and household consumption. TheAustralian Government had also indicated that it would assist areas of the economy most affected by theCOVID-19 outbreak.", "Given these developments, members considered how best to respond, noting that even prior to theCOVID-19 outbreak, progress towards full employment and the inflation target had been expected tobe only gradual. The COVID-19 outbreak was expected to delay that progress further.", "In discussing a possible monetary policy response, members welcomed indications from the AustralianGovernment that fiscal measures would be taken to support investment, the cash flow of affectedbusinesses and jobs. They also discussed the support that lower interest rates would provide to jobs andeconomic activity through a lower exchange rate and a boost to aggregate cash flows for households andbusinesses. Members recognised that the combined monetary and fiscal responses would help the economydeal with the challenges posed by COVID-19.", "As part of their deliberations, members considered a number of scenarios, including one where theCOVID-19 outbreak would be contained in the very near future and where there would be a rapidrecovery in economic activity. In that scenario, the maximum effect of any additional monetary policystimulus would be felt in the recovery phase, rather than in the short term, when policy support wouldmost be needed. However, this scenario was considered very unlikely, with the more realistic scenariobeing that the outbreak would have a significant effect on the Australian economy.", "Members also discussed the risk that a further reduction in interest rates could encourage additionalborrowing at a time when there was already a strong upswing in the housing market. In the currentcontext of heightened uncertainty, that risk was not viewed as particularly high relative to thebenefits from lower interest rates.", "The Board concluded that it was appropriate to ease monetary policy further in response to the globalCOVID-19 outbreak to provide additional support to employment and economic activity. Members agreedthat it was reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates would be required inAustralia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. Members also agreed on theimportance of monitoring the rapidly changing developments closely in subsequent weeks and maintainingcontact to assess the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak for the economy. The Board was preparedto ease monetary policy further to support the Australian economy."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.5 per cent."]}},

Equityprices inthe advanced economies, including in Australia, had fallen by around 30 per cent. Thefallshad been broadly based across sectors, although equity prices in the energy and tourism sectorshadfallen particularly sharply. The equity prices of banks had also fallen significantly, althoughit wasrecognised that the capital and liquidity positions of banks had been strengthened over thepriordecade.", "Liquidity in credit and money markets was very poor and the market for corporate bond issuancewasessentially closed to all but the very highest quality borrowers. Credit spreads in corporatebondmarkets had widened substantially, particularly for high-yield bonds, increasing funding costsforcorporations. Members noted that any further widening in spreads would translate directly intohigherborrowing costs, since government bond yields had very little further room to fall. Yields inmoneymarkets had also risen, although banks and highly rated non-financial corporations were stillable toaccess these markets. The Australian banks had strong funding positions and did not need tosourceadditional funding from bond markets in the near term.", "Government bond markets had displayed signs of dysfunction, with many participants seeking toliquidatetheir portfolios. This had also affected traditionally safe and liquid markets, such as the USTreasurymarket. The increase in yields and volatility partly reflected the unwinding of highly leveragedpositions, and the constrained ability of dealers to absorb additional bonds after havingreachedleverage and capital constraints. The dysfunction in the US Treasury market had spread widely,given itsimportant role as a pricing benchmark for the global financial system.", "In foreign exchange markets, large repatriation flows had supported the yen, and the US dollarhadappreciated against most other currencies. Members observed that the Australian dollar haddepreciatedagainst the US dollar by around 10 per cent over the preceding month, to be atits lowestlevel since 2002. Among other advanced economies, the exchange rates of commodity exporters suchasNorway, Canada and New Zealand had also depreciated notably. Capital flight had been evidentacrossemerging markets, with exchange rates depreciating against the US dollar and sovereign bondyieldsmoving sharply higher.", "In response to these developments, a number of major central banks had made sizable interest ratereductions at unscheduled meetings. The Federal Reserve had cut its policy rate by 100 basispointsafter an earlier cut of 50 basis points. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and theReserveBank of New Zealand had each lowered policy rates to ¼ per cent, and interestrates werelower than this in Japan and Europe.", "Central banks had expanded their standard open market operations to provide short-term liquiditytofinancial institutions, including by lengthening the terms on which liquidity is extended. TosupportAustralian financial markets, the Bank had injected liquidity through its open marketoperations,increasing Exchange Settlement (ES) balances from around $2.5 billion to $14 billion.The Bankhad also announced that it would be conducting daily operations at one- and three-month termsandregular repurchase operations on terms of six months or longer. In a number of jurisdictions,includingin Australia, central banks had stated that they would purchase government bonds in secondarymarkets tosupport their smooth functioning.", "Members noted that many central banks were introducing additional measures to support marketfunctioning and promote the resumption of activity in corporate credit markets. The FederalReserve hadintroduced a commercial paper funding facility to provide a backstop for the market. The Bank ofEngland, acting as agent for the UK Treasury, had announced that it would purchase unlimitedamounts ofcommercial paper issued by non-financial firms with an investment grade credit rating. The BankofEngland and the European Central Bank had expanded funding schemes to encourage banks to lend tobusinesses. There had also been an easing of bank regulatory requirements in many countries.", "The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with a number of other central banks, had also lowered thecost andextended the terms of foreign currency borrowing through foreign exchange swap lines. This wasdesignedto alleviate the very high demand for US dollars from non-US entities that had issued debtinUS dollars that needed to be refinanced.", "Members discussed how these developments and the rapidly changing situation were affecting theoutlookfor economic activity. The immediate outlook for the Australian and global economies was highlyuncertain, but members viewed it as very likely that most countries would experience a verysharpcontraction in economic activity. Members considered the information available for the Chineseeconomy,which indicated that there had been a large contraction in economic activity in the Marchquarter. Someindicators, such as coal usage, suggested that economic activity in China was beginning to pickup,although it was too early to assess the extent to which activity would recover in the Junequarter.", "While it was not possible to provide an updated set of forecasts for the economy given thefluidity ofthe situation, it was likely that Australia would experience a very material contraction ineconomicactivity, which would spread across the March and June quarters and potentially longer. The sizeof thefall in economic activity would depend on the extent of the social distancing requirements, andpotential lockdowns, put in place to contain the virus. The composition of consumption waschangingconsiderably, with spending at supermarkets and pharmacies increasing substantially, whilespending onhospitality and other services was falling sharply. Many service industries were being severelydisrupted, with significant spillovers across the economy. There were likely to be significantjoblosses over the months ahead, although the extent of this would depend on the capacity ofbusinesses toretain employees during this period. At the same time, some industries were employing moreworkers,particularly those involved in the retail supply chain and delivering goods. In time, followingcontainment of COVID-19, the economy is expected to recover, but the timing of this wasuncertain."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["Following their review of recent developments in financial markets and the implications foreconomicactivity, members turned to how monetary policy could most effectively support the Australianeconomythrough the challenging period that lay ahead.", "Members acknowledged that the primary response to the COVID-19 outbreak was to managepeople's health, but that other arms of policy, including monetary and fiscal policy, wouldplay animportant role in reducing the economic and financial disruption. Members noted the measuresthat theBank had taken to support the Australian economy and operation of financial markets over thedayspreceding the meeting.", "The Governor proposed a package of policy measures, which together would assist in supporting theAustralian economy through the period ahead. The focus of the package was on ensuring thatfunding costswere low across the entire economy and that credit remained available to businesses andhouseholds. Thiswould help build the necessary bridge to the economic recovery and support that recovery oncetheCOVID-19 outbreak is contained.", "The elements of the package were discussed in turn.", "1. A further reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent.", "The proposed cut in the cash rate to 0.25 per cent would bring the cumulative declineoverthe preceding year to 1¼ percentage points. Members noted that this would be asubstantialeasing of monetary policy, which, to date, had been boosting the cash flow of businesses and thehousehold sector as a whole and also helping trade-exposed industries through the exchange ratechannel.Members acknowledged that very low interest rates have uneven effects and negative consequencesfor somepeople – especially those relying on interest income – but the evidence was thatlowerinterest rates were benefiting the community as a whole.", "Members supported the proposal and agreed that the cash rate would not be increased from itslowerlevel until progress is made towards full employment and there is confidence that inflation willbesustainably within the 2–3 per target cent range. Given this, it was consideredlikely thatthe cash rate would remain at a very low level for an extended period. Members also agreed thatthe cashrate was now at its effective lower bound. Members had no appetite for negative interest ratesinAustralia.", "2. A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.", "Members considered a proposal to extend and complement the longstanding approach to target thecashrate, which forms the anchor point for the risk-free term structure, by also targeting arisk-freeinterest rate further out along the yield curve. The specific proposal was to target the rate atthethree-year mark, given its importance as a benchmark rate in financial markets and its role infundingacross much of the Australian economy. Such a target would also be consistent with theexpectation thatthe cash rate would remain at a very low level for several years.", "Members supported the intent of the proposal and agreed that it would make most sense, includingfrom acommunication perspective, to set the target at the same rate as the target for the cash rate,namely25 basis points. They acknowledged that the target did not need to be achieved preciselyevery day.Members noted that some time might be needed before yields would fall to the target from theirlevelover the weeks preceding the meeting – of around 45 basis points. Members discussedtheimportance of the Bank's communication focusing on how this target would both support theeconomyin the immediate period and assist with a strong recovery once the COVID-19 outbreak hasbeencontained.", "Members noted that the yield target would be achieved by regular auctions in the secondary bondmarket,whereby the Bank would implement a program to purchase bonds of different maturities, given thehighlevel of substitutability between bonds. The Bank would also be prepared to buy semi-governmentsecurities to achieve the target and help facilitate the smooth functioning of the bond market,andwould work closely with the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) and stategovernmentborrowing authorities. Members noted that, although the program of bond purchases would entailanincrease in the size of the Bank's balance sheet, the focus of the program would be on bondyieldsrather than the quantity and timing of bond purchases. The objective of this component of theproposedpolicy measures would be to add to the downward pressure on funding costs for financialinstitutions,households and businesses.", "Members thought it likely that the target for three-year yields would be maintained untilprogress wasmade towards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target. Furthermore,theyexpressed the view that it would be appropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rateitselfwas raised.", "3. A term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to smallandmedium-sized businesses.", "The proposed scheme had two broad objectives. The first was to lower funding costs for the entirebanking system to ensure a low cost of credit to households and businesses. This objective wouldcomplement the target for the three-year bond yield. The second objective was to provide anincentivefor lenders to support credit to businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses.Membersagreed that this aspect would be vital as many small businesses would be likely to findretaining staffin the period ahead extremely challenging.", "Under the proposed facility, the Bank would provide a three-year funding facility to authoriseddeposit-taking institutions (ADIs) at a fixed rate of 0.25 per cent, which wassubstantiallybelow lenders' current funding costs. ADIs would be able to obtain initial funding of up to3 per cent of their existing outstanding credit until the end of September 2020, andwouldhave access to additional funding if they increased lending to businesses, especially to smallandmedium-sized businesses, with these funds able to be drawn upon until the end of March 2021.This sizeof the proposed facility was at least $90 billion. Members endorsed the proposal that noadditionalallowance be available to finance growth in lending for housing.", "Members expressed support for the proposed scheme and discussed some technical aspects. Theynoted thatinstitutions accessing the scheme would need to provide eligible collateral to the Bank, withhaircutsapplying to provide appropriate risk mitigation. The interest rate that would apply would befixed forthe term of the funding, which was consistent with the Bank's expectation that the cashrate waslikely to stay at a very low level for some time. Members also agreed that including a penaltyrate tocounteract the risk of a reduction in lending could act as a disincentive for institutions toparticipate in the scheme. The Governor indicated that the first drawings under the facilitywould bepossible no later than four weeks from the date of the meeting.", "The Governor informed members that he understood that the Australian Prudential RegulationAuthority(APRA) would support ADIs using the scheme. In addition, the Australian Government was in theprocess ofdeveloping a complementary program of support for the non-bank financial sector, small lendersand thesecuritisation market, which would be implemented by the AOFM. Members observed that suchsupport wouldbe important to assist non-bank financial institutions and small lenders to continue to providecreditto households and businesses.", "4. Exchange settlement (ES) balances at the Reserve Bank to be remunerated at 10 basispoints,rather than zero as would have been the case under the previous arrangements.", "The Governor outlined the implications of the proposed policy measures for the cash market. Theexisting ‘corridor system’ means that the balances financial institutions hold withtheReserve Bank overnight earn an interest rate 25 basis points below the cash rate, and inthe eventthat a financial institution needed to borrow from the Reserve Bank overnight, it would becharged25 basis points above the cash rate. Should the cash rate be reduced to 25 basispoints, theinterest rate on ES balances would be zero. In view of the significant increase in the balancesheld inES accounts resulting from the combined effect of the Bank's enhanced liquidity operations,bondpurchases and the term funding program, maintaining a zero interest rate on these balances wouldincrease the costs to the banking system.", "Members agreed that such an outcome would be undesirable in the current environment. Theyendorsed theproposal to alleviate this cost by increasing the rate of interest on settlement balances to10 basis points. No change to the arrangements for the top of the corridor were proposed.Membersnoted that the increase in ES balances would be likely to change the way that the cash marketoperates.In particular, large increases in ES balances could result in the cash rate drifting below thetarget astransaction volumes in the cash market decline, as had occurred in other countries in similarcircumstances.", "In considering the overall package of measures that had been discussed, members acknowledged thattheterm funding scheme and the three-year bond yield target were both significant policydevelopments thatwould not have been under consideration in normal times. Nonetheless, members strongly supportedtheproposed policy response as a comprehensive package to complement the fiscal response announcedbygovernments in Australia in the preceding week or so.", "Members endorsed the continuation of close policy coordination that had been taking place amongtheBank, the federal and state governments and government agencies. They expressed the view that,in theBank's communication, it would be important to emphasise that the Bank expected a recoveryonce theCOVID-19 outbreak has been contained, and that the recovery would be supported by the lowcost offunding across the economy."], "The Decision": ["The Board agreed on a package of measures, comprising four elements, namely:", "The measures would be announced in a media release at 2.30 pm AEDT the following afternoon,19 March, following processes to ensure coordination of related policy announcements byAPRA andthe AOFM.

The outbreak was first and foremost a public health issue, but wasalso having very large adverse effects on economies and financial systems around the world. Financialconditions had been highly volatile in March, reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook,increased uncertainty and a substantial increase in demand for cash over other assets. Central banks hadresponded forcefully with a wide range of policy measures. In response to these measures and sizeableresponses from fiscal authorities, financial conditions had stabilised but remained fragile.", "Central banks had taken actions to lower risk-free rates across the yield curve. Policy rates hadbeen reduced where there was scope to do so, and were at ¼ per cent or lower in all ofthe major advanced economies. Purchases of government bonds had been scaled up significantly. As aresult of these purchases, central bank balance sheets had expanded rapidly in March.", "Central banks had also sought to accommodate increased demand for cash and support marketfunctioning. They had increased the provision of liquidity to the financial system by increasing thesize and extending the maturity of their regular open market operations. Many central banks had alsosought to improve market functioning – particularly of key bond markets that provide importantpricing benchmarks – by directly purchasing securities in secondary markets. The US FederalReserve had acted to help meet demand for US dollars from non-US entities, most notably byactivating and extending its network of bilateral swap lines with other central banks, including theReserve Bank of Australia.", "There had been a range of actions to support the supply of credit, particularly to businesses.Central banks were introducing or expanding term funding schemes to provide low-cost funds to banks andencourage them to continue supplying credit to businesses and households. Prudential measures had madeit easier for banks to expand their balance sheets. These measures had complemented actions bygovernments to assist business borrowers directly.", "Members noted that the actions taken by central banks in sovereign bond markets had helped to supportmarket liquidity and put downward pressure on yields. Liquidity conditions in the market for USTreasuries (as reflected in bid-ask spreads) had improved since mid March, but had not yet fullynormalised. Declines in longer-term yields had been limited as market participants were factoring inthe prospect of significantly higher volumes of bond issuance to fund large fiscal deficits over theperiod ahead. Nevertheless, sovereign bond yields across the advanced economies remained at low levels.Spreads between Italian and Spanish yields and those of German Bunds had widened in early March as theCOVID-19 outbreaks in those countries had intensified, and amid concerns about conditions in thebanking systems and the sustainability of their public finances. However, the new asset purchaseprogram established by the European Central Bank had helped to contain the widening of thesespreads.", "Conditions in US dollar funding markets had tightened significantly, although stresses in thesemarkets had eased since mid March. Spreads in short-term unsecured US dollar funding markets hadrisen, reflecting increased demand for liquidity and limitations on the capacity of financialinstitutions to intermediate these markets. In response, the Federal Reserve had implemented severalpolicy measures to increase the supply of US dollars, which had helped to stabilise or narrowspreads in some markets. The bilateral swap lines between the Federal Reserve and other major centralbanks had been utilised extensively to provide US dollar liquidity to financial institutions,particularly in Europe and Japan. In contrast, there had not been much demand for US dollarfunding from Australian financial institutions.", "Members noted that funding markets remained strained for corporations, particularly those whoserevenues were most exposed to the economic impact of the measures to contain COVID-19 or werehighly leveraged. Corporate bond spreads had risen, but overall borrowing costs were still modest byhistorical standards, reflecting the historically low levels of government bond yields. Marketconditions in primary corporate bond markets had been mixed. Corporations with high credit quality hadissued record volumes of debt in March to build cash reserves. In contrast, issuance of high-yield debthad largely ceased. Other risky asset classes, such as equities, remained volatile.", "In emerging market economies, government bond yields had risen sharply, equity prices had fallen andexchange rates had depreciated. There had also been substantial capital outflows. The tightening infinancial conditions partly reflected concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on output growth inthese economies, particularly for commodity exporters and countries that had recently received financein large part via foreign capital and/or in foreign currency. A number of emerging market andlow-income economies had engaged in discussions with international organisations about accessingemergency financing facilities. In contrast, financial conditions in China had been stable in recentweeks, and Chinese equity prices had been relatively resilient.", "Movements in currencies had reflected strong demand for US dollars in the middle of March, withthe US dollar appreciating against currencies of both advanced and emerging economies. Particularlylarge moves had been observed in the exchange rates of commodity exporters. Since the start of the year,the Australian dollar had depreciated against the US dollar through to mid March to its lowestlevel since the early 2000s before partly retracing, to be around 15 per cent lower in netterms."], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["Members reviewed the implementation of the package of policy measures announced by the Bank on19 March and its initial effects on domestic financial conditions. The package included a reductionin the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent and introduction of a target for the yield on 3-yearAustralian government bonds of around 0.25 per cent. The Bank had also announced that it wouldbe prepared to purchase government bonds across the yield curve to ensure the smooth functioning ofgovernment bond markets. In addition, the package included a term funding facility (TFF) for authoriseddeposit-taking institutions (ADIs), offering collateralised funding of at least $90 billion forthree years at an interest rate of 25 basis points, with additional amounts available toinstitutions that increase their lending to businesses, especially to small and medium-sized businesses.Finally, Exchange Settlement balances at the Bank would be remunerated at 10 basis points, ratherthan zero as would have been the case under the previous corridor arrangements.", "The three-year government bond yield fell noticeably on the announcement of the policy package, fromaround 60 basis points to around 30 basis points, and declined a little further in response tobond purchases by the Bank, to be at the target of around 25 basis points. In addition to purchasesof Australian government bonds at around three years, the Bank had also purchased government bondsacross the yield curve, including state and territory government bonds. The Bank had purchased inaggregate around $36 billion of government bonds in secondary markets. This had contributed togenerally improved functioning of these markets, including a reduction in bid-ask spreads andachievement of the three-year yield target. Furthermore, the Australian Office of Financial Management(AOFM) and state and territory government borrowing authorities had issued securities, consistent withmarket conditions having improved.", "Alongside these purchases, the Bank had injected around $50 billion of liquidity into thefinancial system through its daily open market operations to support credit and maintain low fundingcosts in the economy. The Bank had provided this liquidity at longer terms than usual, with the averagematurity of the Bank's repurchase agreements increasing from around 30 days to 70 days.As expected, the high level of Exchange Settlement balances had seen the cash rate decline below25 basis points, to be around 20 basis points at the time of the meeting. Market participantsexpected the cash rate to be around 15 basis points for an extended period, a little above the10 basis point deposit rate on Exchange Settlement balances.", "The package of policy measures was putting downward pressure on bank funding costs, offsetting theeffects of higher spreads in some wholesale funding markets. The reduction in the cash rate and theincrease in Exchange Settlement balances had helped to lower short-term benchmark rates for bankfunding. In addition, funding was available through the TFF at substantially lower than market rates.ADIs had started to draw down their allocations under the TFF on 6 April. The TFF was beingcomplemented by other policy measures to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses, includingthe government's guarantee of 50 per cent on new loans for working capital. In addition,the AOFM had begun purchasing asset-backed securities as part of its program to support lending bynon-ADIs and small ADIs.", "The Bank's package of policy measures, along with other announced initiatives by the federal andstate governments and the Australian banks, was allowing households and businesses to access credit onconsiderably more favourable terms than otherwise. Banks had reduced interest rates for small businessborrowers markedly, and small business customers affected by the COVID-19 outbreak would be able todefer interest and loan payments for six months. For households, a large proportion of the monetarypolicy easing since May 2019 had flowed through to mortgage rates paid. Lenders had reduced theirinterest rates on variable rate housing loans by 25 basis points following the reduction in thecash rate on 3 March. While most lenders did not reduce their standard variable rates following thefurther cut in the cash rate on 19 March, they had announced a reduction for interest rates onfixed rate loans and measures to defer interest and loan payments for distressed households."], "Financial Stability": ["Members were briefed on the Bank's regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system.", "The COVID-19 outbreak had ended an extended period of low financial market volatility and lowrisk premiums, which had been underpinned by investors' expectations of continued benign economicand financial market conditions. Members noted that the current situation was very different from theglobal financial crisis, as the shock had not emanated from the financial system. As a result ofregulatory reforms following the global financial crisis, banks were in a much stronger position thanprior to the global financial crisis. Members noted that, rather than being a source of the shock, thefinancial system was well placed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.", "Existing risks to financial stability were being amplified by the pandemic: debt had increased tohigh levels in corporate and household sectors in some countries; some non-bank financial institutionshad high leverage; and some European countries had weak banking systems and high sovereign debt. Bankswere also facing increased operational risks given the need to operate from split sites and with moststaff working remotely.", "Members noted that the Australian banks were in a strong position to withstand the large economicshock from the COVID-19 outbreak and financial market volatility. The capital and liquiditypositions of the banks had increased substantially since the global financial crisis. Banks'leverage ratios (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to non-risk-weighted assets) had also increased. Theliquidity coverage ratios of banks were well above their regulatory minimums and had recently increasedfurther as a result of the TFF. Banks had high profits, their return on equity prior to theCOVID-19 outbreak was well above their cost of equity, and they had low rates of bad and doubtfuldebts. The expected contraction in economic activity would, however, result in a rising proportion ofnon-performing loans. But banks were well placed to absorb these, given their strong capital buffers.The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority had noted that the banks were able to access thesebuffers to sustain credit growth in the economy.", "The decline in asset prices had had a significant effect on superannuation fund returns and somefunds would face additional withdrawals in the period ahead.", "Following the COVID-19 outbreak, banks and other financial institutions in Australia hadimplemented their business continuity plans. This involved large numbers of staff working from home andsplit sites to ensure there was redundancy in critical operations. This had required significantadaption of their continuity plans to the specific nature of the pandemic, but to date this hadproceeded without major incident. Banks' changed operating environments and their resultingreduced capacity to take on risk had affected the functioning of some markets. There were alsoincreased risks from failures of legacy IT systems and cyber attacks.", "Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, business balance sheets in Australia were generally in a healthystate, as most companies had relatively low levels of gearing and sufficient liquid assets to weather amoderate shock to their income. Australian companies had generally deleveraged since the globalfinancial crisis. However, the contraction resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak would be a verylarge shock to many businesses, particularly in industries most exposed to the fall in economicactivity. The potential to reduce outlays through measures such as wage subsidies and rentre-negotiations, along with access to credit, were important measures to ensure the viability of asmany businesses as possible through the current crisis.", "Most households with mortgages had significant buffers of accumulated prepayments, with around half ofthese loans having prepayments that exceeded six months of payments; the share of mortgages that may nothave a buffer of liquid assets was around 15 per cent. Measures of household financial stresshad been at relatively low levels prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Members were informed that, atthe time of the meeting, banks had reported that around 5 per cent of households had enquiredabout deferring mortgage repayments.", "Risks from residential property markets had diminished over the course of the preceding year asincreases in housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne had led to a reduction in the share of households atrisk of having negative equity on their housing assets. Nationally, around 3 per cent ofmortgages had negative equity positions, with most of these in Western Australia. The more recenteconomic contraction, uncertainty and social distancing measures were likely to result in very littleturnover in the housing market. It remained unclear how this would affect residential propertyprices.", "Members noted that conditions in commercial property markets were deteriorating. This followed severalyears of commercial property price growth in excess of growth in rents. Prior to theCOVID-19 outbreak, parts of the retail property market were facing challenging conditions owing toweak consumer spending and heightened competition. Following the outbreak, some retail tenants had beenseeking suspensions in rent payments or large rent reductions. Members noted that the risks incommercial property markets warranted close monitoring."], "International Economic Developments": ["Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that the measures needed to containthe COVID-19 outbreak would result in an economic contraction that would have been unimaginable afew months earlier. The exact size of the contraction would depend on each economy's industrystructure and the public's responses. The lockdown and other containment measures were expected toremain in place for at least a couple of months in most countries, although there was considerableuncertainty about the extent of this, as well as the variability of the measures across countries.", "Most official data for advanced economies had not yet captured the full effects of domestic containmentmeasures. Nonetheless, business surveys of conditions in the services sector had fallen considerablyacross most advanced economies in March and labour market indicators had also deteriorated. In theUnited States, employment had fallen sharply and new claims on unemployment insurance had increasedrapidly; the unemployment rate had increased around 1 percentage point by the time of the survey inmid March, but this was likely to have escalated significantly by the end of March.", "Monthly indicators of industrial production in China had fallen sharply in January and February,consistent with more timely indicators, such as coal consumption by power plants, which had remained lowfollowing the Lunar New Year holiday. Retail sales had also fallen sharply and property markets hadeffectively shut. Through March, there had been signs of a recovery in a range of timely indicators,consistent with some easing in containment measures, although members noted that the return to morenormal conditions had been more gradual than previously expected.", "The decline in economic activity following the containment measures in many economies had beenexacerbated by declines in trade and second-round income and demand effects. Accordingly, GDP wasprojected to contract by at least 10 per cent in the United States, the euro area and Chinaover a couple of quarters. The contractions in some of Australia's other trading partners,particularly in Asia, were likely to be smaller, but still significant. These estimates were in linewith those of international agencies. A number of emerging and low-income economies were in particularlyvulnerable situations because they had less capacity in their health systems and they had beenexperiencing capital outflows; there had been growing concerns that a flight of capital could trigger adeeper economic contraction in those countries.", "A recovery was expected once the COVID-19 outbreak was contained, but members noted that thetiming and speed of that recovery was highly uncertain and the possibility of renewed outbreakspresented an additional downside risk. The recovery would be assisted by the very large responses ofboth monetary and fiscal policy. The fiscal responses had been designed to sustain the productivecapacity of economies during the containment measures by reducing business failures, preservingemployment and providing a level of replacement income for people who become unemployed or have theirwork hours reduced. The fiscal policy measures included: expanded unemployment benefits; direct paymentsto individuals; funding for small businesses; incentives to maintain employment; and deferments of taxpayments and other payment obligations. The fiscal response in many countries had been much larger thanduring the global financial crisis.", "Most commodity prices had fallen noticeably in anticipation of weaker global demand, although prices ofthe bulk commodities most significant for Australia's export revenues had been relativelyresilient. The sharp decline in oil prices in preceding weeks had been partly a response to the declinein demand associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. But it had also partly been an independent shock,because some major producers had boosted supply for strategic reasons. For most economies, includingAustralia, lower oil prices were expected to be disinflationary in the short run and would flow throughto the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports over the course of the following few quarters. Thelower oil prices had also meant that some LNG projects were now unlikely to go ahead within previouslyexpected timeframes."], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["Members observed that most of the available domestic economic data pre-dated the COVID-19 outbreakand had been consistent with a gradual improvement in the Australian economy over 2020. In February, theunemployment rate had declined to 5.1 per cent and there had been a jump in private sectorbuilding approvals. Housing prices had also risen strongly over February and had increased over March,although market conditions deteriorated over the second half of the month.", "In March, the Australian Government had announced three packages of policies focused on providingassistance to households and business. The largest package had been the JobKeeper payment announced on30 March, which would provide a wage subsidy for businesses that had experienced a significant fallin turnover. The government had also announced that it would provide cash-flow support to small andmedium-sized businesses, and investment incentives to businesses with turnover of up to$500 million. By supporting employment, these policies were expected to provide a safety net forhouseholds, helping them maintain their spending on necessities and other obligations. The governmenthad also announced that it would provide some direct transfers to households, including a temporaryincrease in the JobSeeker payment.", "Members noted that the policies should cushion the labour market adjustment and reduce the financialstress of households and businesses. However, they observed that it was unlikely that these policieswould provide a strong boost to spending in the near term given the broadening shutdown of non-essentialactivities and the restrictions placed on household activities. The states and territories had alsocommitted to a number of spending packages, predominantly targeted at small and medium-sized businesses,along with providing support to households.", "Retail sales had increased in February, as strength in grocery sales had offset weakness in sales ofclothing and some services. Members noted that liaison with retailers had highlighted a much largershift in household spending patterns through March as social distancing measures were put in place.Household consumption spending was expected to be much lower than usual in the June quarter becausespecific types of spending, including on travel, dining out and certain recreational services, were notpossible under the current restrictions. These estimates were in line with those for other advancedcountries subject to similar restrictions, as well as with indications of spending patterns frombusiness liaison and other private sector sources. Travel and other service exports, particularlyeducation, were also expected to remain very low for some time, on the assumption that current bordercontrols would be in place for a number of months.", "Deferrals and cancellations of business investment plans had been a theme in discussions with liaisoncontacts, and recent survey indicators of business conditions had fallen sharply. These discussions hadalso highlighted that weaker demand conditions, including for short-term rental accommodation, wereexpected to extend the weakness in residential construction. These effects on GDP were expected to bepartially offset by stronger public demand and the introduction of income support measures. Incombination, these considerations suggested that GDP could fall significantly in the June quarter andremain subdued in the September quarter. Real estate, hospitality and tourism, along with many parts ofretail, essentially would not operate while the current restrictions remain in place, while someindustries, including health care, utilities and mining, would be less affected.", "Members noted that there would be a very sharp decline in hours worked, which was expected to beassociated with significant increases in both the unemployment rate and the number of people workingreduced hours. Although the JobKeeper subsidy was expected to increase the number of people remainingemployed, household incomes were expected to be much lower."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members noted that the coordinated monetary and fiscal response,together with complementary measures taken by ADIs and other businesses, would soften the expectedeconomic contraction and help support the economy's recovery once the health crisis has passed andrestrictions have been removed. These various responses were providing considerable support toAustralian households and businesses through this very difficult period. Members noted that theAustralian financial system remained resilient. It was well capitalised and in a strong liquidityposition, with these financial buffers available to be drawn upon if required to support theeconomy.", "The policy package announced by the Bank on 19 March had helped to lower funding costs andstabilise financial conditions, and would support the expected recovery. The package had contributed toan easing of strains in government bond markets and the three-year Australian government bond yield haddeclined to be at the target of around 25 basis points. The Bank would continue to do what wasnecessary to achieve the three-year yield target, with the target expected to remain in place untilprogress was being made towards its goals for full employment and inflation. The Bank would alsocontinue to promote the smooth functioning of these important markets. Members noted that, if conditionscontinued to improve, it was likely that smaller and less frequent purchases of government bonds wouldbe required.", "The Bank had injected substantial liquidity into the financial system through its daily open marketoperations to support credit and maintain low funding costs in the economy. Given the substantialliquidity that was already in the system and the commencement of the TFF, daily open market operationswere likely to be on a smaller scale in the near term. Members noted that operations at longer termswould continue, but the frequency of these operations would be adjusted as necessary according to marketconditions.", "The Board remained committed to supporting jobs, incomes and businesses as Australia responds to theCOVID-19 outbreak."], "The Decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the elements of the policy package announced on 19 March 2020, namely:", "The Board confirmed that the target for three-year yields would be maintained until progress was madetowards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would beappropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself was raised. The Board would notincrease the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment and it is confident thatinflation will be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target band."]}},

GDP in Australia's major tradingpartners was expected to decline significantly over the first half of 2020. The timing and size of thecontraction in activity was likely to vary across countries, depending on the strictness and durationof the lockdowns, and on the industrial structure of their economies. When the restrictions are eased,economies could be expected to begin to recover, supported by stimulus from both fiscal and monetarypolicy. Members noted that lingering concerns about the virus, including over possible renewedoutbreaks, could nonetheless continue to weigh on the spending decisions of households and businesses.Although the global economy was expected to begin to recover in the second half of 2020, theInternational Monetary Fund was forecasting a large contraction for 2020 as a whole.", "The Chinese economy had contracted by almost 10 per cent in the March quarter. While someparts of the economy had already begun to recover in the month of March as restrictions were eased,members noted that the improvement had been uneven. Industrial production had recovered strongly in themonth and other timely indicators suggested that activity more broadly was approaching pre-outbreaklevels. Exports had also recovered to a large extent, and members noted that concerns aboutChina-related disruptions to global supply chains had receded. In contrast, fixed asset investment hadpicked up only modestly and retail spending had remained subdued.", "In the major advanced economies, GDP was expected to contract from peak to trough by between10 and 15 per cent because of lockdowns and other restrictions on activity. Most of thiscontraction was expected to occur in the June quarter, although some of the effect had been apparent infigures for the March quarter; in that period, GDP had contracted by 1.2 per cent in theUnited States and by 3.8 per cent in the euro area. Survey data had recorded sharp declinesin business conditions in April, particularly in the services sector, which had been most affected bycontainment measures.", "Some economies in Asia, including South Korea, were expected to have smaller contractions in thefirst half of 2020 because their restrictions had been more targeted. However, economies across theregion had faced weak external demand, initially from China and more recently from other tradingpartners. Service exports had been particularly affected given that inbound tourism had essentiallyceased as a result of travel restrictions. India's economy had been under a relatively stringentnationwide lockdown since late March, although there had been some easing in early May.", "The labour market implications of the lockdowns and social distancing measures had been severe. Forexample, claims for unemployment benefits had reached unprecedented levels in the United States andCanada, and unemployment rates were expected to have risen to double digits in many advanced economiesin April. Wage subsidy schemes were expected to have tempered the increase in unemployment in someeconomies, including Germany. These schemes were also expected to support the subsequent recovery byavoiding a wide-scale severing of employment relationships.", "The decline in global demand had affected the prices of many commodities, especially oil. Productioncuts agreed by major oil producers had not been enough to offset this. The fall in oil prices wouldflow through to contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) with a lag; in response, some large LNGinvestment projects in Australia had been deferred. In contrast, iron ore prices had been supportedbecause Chinese demand had held up and supply from Brazil had remained constrained. More generally,global inflation was expected to decline and remain low for some time given the weakness in aggregatedemand."], "Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook": ["The Australian economy had been severely affected by the imposition of measures to contain theoutbreak of COVID-19. Australian GDP was expected to contract by around 10 per cent over thefirst half of 2020. Most of the contraction was expected to occur in the June quarter, although adecline in travel service exports and some domestic spending had weighed on activity in the Marchquarter. An economic contraction of such speed and magnitude would be unprecedented in the 60-yearhistory of Australia's quarterly national accounts. Members noted that the nature of thecontraction and the expected recovery was also unprecedented because they were driven by public healthmeasures, rather than induced by economic or financial factors.", "Retail spending had increased strongly in March because households had prepared for the period ofsocial distancing and potential supply chain disruptions by stocking up on some grocery andpharmaceutical items and purchasing household goods such as home office and exercise equipment; incontrast, spending in cafes and restaurants had fallen very significantly. Overall, preliminary datafor March indicated that retail sales had experienced one of the largest monthly increases in thehistory of the series, similar in size to the increase in retail sales in the lead-up to theintroduction of the goods and services tax in 2000. However, estimates from retailers in theBank's business liaison program suggested that retail sales had fallen in April. Spending onservices and other categories of consumption was also expected to have fallen, consistent with thesocial distancing and travel restrictions that had been put in place.", "Household consumption was expected to contract by around 15 per cent over the first half of2020. Members observed that, as restrictions were lifted, the effects of lower employment, incomes andwealth would become relatively more important for the consumption outlook.", "Social distancing restrictions on home inspections and in-person auctions, as well as heighteneduncertainty about the future, had significantly reduced turnover in the established housing market.Members noted that some of the concerns that construction activity could be severely affected in thenear term by supply chain disruptions and health-related site closures had not been realised. However,contacts in the liaison program had reported that demand for both new and established housing hadfallen. Lower incomes and confidence, as well as lower expected population growth, were expected toaffect demand for new housing for an extended period. Members also discussed the effect of a possibleincrease in the number of people moving back home or living in larger households for financial reasons.At the same time, the supply of rental housing had been boosted as properties that had previously beenoffered as short-term accommodation were shifted to the long-term rental market.", "Businesses had been grappling with deteriorating economic conditions and low confidence about futuredemand. Many liaison contacts had reported that they were taking steps to preserve cash flow, includingdeferring non-essential investment. Non-mining business investment was therefore expected to declinesignificantly. Mining investment was likely to be relatively more resilient, although weaker thanpreviously expected largely because of deferred LNG projects.", "Members also discussed the impact on investment of possible changes in the pattern of activity afterthe recovery. Examples included the potential for significant changes in demand for office space ifmore people worked from home on a regular basis, and a continuing shift of retail activity away frombricks-and-mortar stores if retailers expand their online operations.", "The March labour force survey had referenced the first half of the month and therefore had not shownsigns of contraction; employment had increased modestly and the unemployment rate had been5.2 per cent. However, payroll data published by the ABS indicated that over the five weeksto mid April there had been a significant decline in the number of paid jobs across many industries,especially those related to tourism, entertainment and dining out. As well as being the activities mostaffected by social distancing requirements and movement restrictions, these industries employ a highshare of workers on casual arrangements. Job advertisements had declined noticeably in March and April.Members noted that, at the same time, firms in some industries, including agriculture, were looking toemploy more workers.", "Overall, the peak-to-trough decline in total hours worked was expected to be around20 per cent; this was expected to be larger than the decline in output, partly because manyof the most-affected activities were highly labour-intensive. ABS surveys of households and businessessuggested that some of the labour market adjustment had occurred through lower average hours worked bythose remaining in employment rather than through job losses. Information from the business liaisonprogram suggested that many firms had asked staff to take paid leave or work shorter hours. These weaklabour market conditions were in turn expected to result in slower wages growth; wage freezes werelikely to become more common, and there had already been isolated reports in liaison of wagecuts.", "The unemployment rate was expected to peak at around 10 per cent in the June quarter.Members noted that this figure would have been much higher were it not for the JobKeeper wage subsidyscheme. The temporary suspension of job search requirements for eligibility for the JobSeekerunemployment benefit was also expected to lower measured unemployment rates, as some recipients wouldnot actively search for work, in part because public health measures had made doing so more difficult.Members observed that, despite the size and breadth of these programs, some people who had lost workwould not be eligible for either payment.", "The outlook for the labour market suggested that growth in labour income would fall in the near term,although the increase in social assistance payments would provide some support to household incomesover this period. Lower interest payments had already provided a small boost to the disposable incomesof households with mortgages and other debt. In terms of government finances, members noted that lowerhousehold income growth would result in lower tax receipts at the same time as there was an increase insocial assistance payments and other fiscal stimulus measures.", "Inflation pressures had increased a little up to the March quarter. Year-ended CPI inflation had been2.2 per cent and trimmed mean inflation had been 1.8 per cent. The effect of theCOVID-19 outbreak on prices had been limited in the quarter, although it had been evident in theprices of items where retail demand was strongest in March, in particular rice, pasta and non-durablehousehold products such as toilet paper, soap and hand sanitiser. Grocery prices had continued to beboosted by the effects of drought in the March quarter.", "The COVID-19 restrictions were expected to have a very large effect on prices in the Junequarter. Headline CPI was expected to fall by around 2¼ per cent in the June quarter,driven by the decline in petrol prices and the removal of childcare fees. More generally, governmentactions to reduce some administered prices in the current environment, while assisting households, werealso expected to contribute to lower inflation in the near term. The anticipated slowing in growth inlabour costs and decline in rent inflation were expected to put downward pressure on inflation over theforecast period. These factors were expected to more than offset any price rises stemming from supplydisruptions or the depreciation of the exchange rate.", "Members noted that beyond the first half of 2020, the outlook for the domestic economy would dependon how long restrictions on economic activity were in place and how long uncertainty and diminishedconfidence weighed on the spending, hiring and investment plans of households and businesses. Given theuncertainties, members considered three plausible scenarios for the outlook.", "The baseline scenario assumed that the process of relaxing social distancing measures would continueover coming months, but that restrictions on large gatherings and national border controls would remainin place until towards the end of the year. Under the baseline scenario, the economy was expected tobegin recovering gradually over the second half of 2020. However, the level of output was expected toremain lower – and the unemployment rate higher – at the end of the forecast period thanhad been projected in February.", "Australia had achieved a relatively rapid decline in new cases of COVID-19 and some states hadalready relaxed some restrictions. Members therefore also contemplated an upside scenario that assumedmost domestic activity restrictions would be relaxed sooner and that the economy would recover somewhatfaster than in the baseline scenario. In this scenario, it was likely that employment growth andspending would recover more rapidly, while the unemployment rate would decline more quickly; betterhealth outcomes elsewhere in the world would reinforce this positive dynamic. The level of GDP at theend of the forecast period in this scenario would still be lower than had been expected in February, inpart because of the lags involved in non-residential construction projects and the deferral of largeLNG projects.", "Members also considered a more negative scenario, which could occur if the lifting of restrictions wereto be delayed or the restrictions needed to be reimposed. In this scenario, there could be ongoingconcerns about the virus, and a slower pick-up in spending even after the restrictions were liftedbecause household and business confidence would remain low for longer. GDP would be expected to remainaround its trough for several quarters and unemployment near its peak into the following year. Thesubsequent recovery would also be slower than in the other scenarios, even if the virus were eventuallycontained, because the longer downturn would involve more job losses and business failures, andtherefore do more lasting damage to employer–employee connections and supplier networks.", "Inflation was expected to remain below the trajectory anticipated in February in all three scenarios.The main differences in the expected paths for inflation related to different degrees of spare capacityin the labour market, resulting in growth in labour costs slowing to varying degrees."], "International Financial Markets": ["Following the sharp tightening in March, financial conditions in many economies eased in April, aidedby extensive policy measures by central banks and governments and reflecting less pessimism amid aslowing in the spread of COVID-19 in most advanced economies.", "Members noted that market functioning in sovereign bond markets had improved significantly, as hadconditions in key money markets. As a result, a number of central banks had scaled back bond purchasesaimed at supporting market functioning, as well as the extent of their market operations to provideliquidity. This was also the case in Australia. Sovereign bond yields had stabilised or declinedslightly in April in a number of advanced economies, including in Australia, to be at or near historiclows. This was despite the issuance of public debt having picked up noticeably and it being likely toremain at historically high levels in the period ahead.", "Since early April, a number of central banks in advanced economies had also expanded existing programsor introduced new programs to support the provision of credit to specific sectors or markets thatremained under strain. Members noted that this had helped to lower borrowing costs for somecorporations, and state and local governments in some economies. Central banks had made clear that theystood ready to provide further stimulus if required.", "The easing in financial conditions through April was evident in a range of other indicators, but hadnot been uniform. Corporate credit spreads had tightened and bond issuance in the United States andEurope had rebounded strongly, with a resumption of investment flows into credit-focused money marketand corporate bond funds. At the same time, many corporations had drawn on pre-existing credit lines asa source of funding. Nevertheless, for lower-rated corporate and sovereign borrowers, funding costsremained higher than before the onset of the pandemic and market conditions remained fragile. Thisincluded parts of Europe, where there was a risk of sovereign credit rating downgrades and borrowingcosts remained volatile.", "Members also noted that equity prices in many advanced economies, including Australia, had recoveredaround half the losses since their trough in late March, reflecting a slowdown in the spread ofCOVID-19 and the strong policy responses. Nevertheless, valuations for certain sectors, includingbanks and energy companies, had fallen materially over the preceding quarter or so. This reflectedexpectations of a particularly challenging period for earnings growth and capital raising for thoseindustries in the months ahead. Volatility of equity prices overall remained higher than longer-termaverages. These developments in global equities had also been observed in Australia.", "In China, conditions in financial markets had remained relatively stable throughout theCOVID-19 pandemic and credit growth had continued at a steady pace. As in the financial crises of2008 and 1998, the renminbi had remained stable, with foreign exchange reserves having declined a littlefrom high levels. Financial conditions in other emerging market economies had recently stabilised aftera sharp tightening in March. The return of capital flows and policy easing domestically and in advancedeconomies had supported asset prices, and exchange rates had appreciated somewhat. However, membersnoted that substantial risks in emerging markets remained, particularly for those economies that arevulnerable to a sustained period of low commodity prices and/or have sizeable foreign debt, particularlywhere denominated in foreign currencies and unhedged.", "Like many other financial markets, the functioning of global foreign exchange markets had improved,helped in part by the supply of US dollars made available through foreign exchange swap lines. Butconditions had yet to return fully to those prevailing prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Over thepreceding few weeks, the US dollar had recorded a small but broad-based depreciation afterappreciating strongly during the first quarter of the year. Members also noted the appreciation of theAustralian dollar from its low point in mid March. This had followed an earlier period where theAustralian dollar had depreciated even more sharply, such that the exchange rate remained around5 per cent lower over the year to date."], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["The package of monetary policy measures implemented by the Bank in mid March was working broadly asexpected.", "Since mid March, the Bank had purchased a total of about $50 billion of Australian GovernmentSecurities (AGS) and semi-government securities (semis). The yield on 3-year AGS had remained at thetarget of around 25 basis points and market functioning had significantly improved for governmentbonds. Daily volatility in AGS bond yields and bid-offer spreads had declined since their peaks in midMarch, while measures of market depth had increased. Consequently, the Bank had gradually reduced thesize, and more recently the frequency, of its bond auctions, which initially had been conducted daily.This had occurred at the same time as there had been a large increase in the issuance of both AGS andsemis, which had been achieved at low yields. The various tenders for AGS had been met by consistentlystrong demand, and the yield curve had shifted down significantly since early March. The amount andmaturity of the Bank's daily open market operations had also been scaled back over the prior monthin response to improving market conditions and reduced demand for liquidity from the Bank'scounterparties. This reflected the ample liquidity already in the banking system, including as a resultof other elements of the Bank's policy package.", "Members noted that, in response to the large amount of liquidity in the banking system, ExchangeSettlement balances held by banks were high, reducing banks' need to borrow from each other in theovernight market. Consequently, the cash rate had drifted a little lower, to be around 14 basispoints, where market participants expected it to remain for some time.", "The package of monetary policy measures had also contributed to a further decline in bank fundingcosts. Members noted that deposit rates, and short- and long-term domestic wholesale borrowing rates,were as low as they had ever been in Australia. There had been some issuance by Australian banks inwholesale markets, and a number of foreign banks had raised bonds in the Australian market in April.Overall, Australian banks' needs for additional funding were currently low, since they had strongliquidity and funding positions. Reflecting this, members noted that, to date, there had been modesttake-up of funding from the Bank's Term Funding Facility, which provides low-cost funding at0.25 per cent for a term of three years. However, banks were expected to draw on thisfacility to replace more expensive term funding as it matures, which would help to keep funding costslow.", "Banks had lowered interest rates for business borrowers substantially since mid March, in light ofthe Bank's policy package as well as government initiatives to support lending to small andmedium-sized businesses. Interest rates for small businesses had declined most and many of thesebusinesses had been offered loan payment deferrals for up to six months. Liaison with banks suggestedthat around 20 per cent of eligible businesses had taken up this option.", "Members noted that business credit growth had picked up strongly in March. Most of this risereflected larger businesses drawing on existing credit lines, as had been seen in a range of othercountries. It was too early to assess how much of this funding was urgently required or moreprecautionary in nature. Several large non-financial corporations had also issued bonds offshore in therecent period. In contrast to larger firms, bank lending to small and medium-sized businesses waslittle changed. Members noted that loan applications were often taking longer to process, partlyreflecting administrative delays as financial institutions responded to a high volume ofenquiries.", "Banks had also reduced housing interest rates to record lows. Members observed that a large share ofthe monetary policy easing since May 2019 had been passed through to variable mortgage rates, andadvertised fixed mortgage rates had declined even further over recent months. Banks had also offeredhousing borrowers loan payment deferrals for up to six months, with a reported take-up rate of around10 per cent for the largest lenders and somewhat less for smaller lenders. Meanwhile, manyother borrowers were maintaining mortgage payments in excess of their required minimum payments.", "The sharp decline in economic activity was expected to dampen the demand for borrowing frombusinesses and households for some time."], "Financial Stability": ["Members continued their discussion of financial stability issues from the previous meeting, focusingon some particular risks to financial stability that were being monitored closely.", "Internationally, banks were generally in a stronger position than they had been entering the globalfinancial crisis, since they now had substantially more capital and liquidity. However, in somejurisdictions, banks had low profits and their large holdings of sovereign debt in their home countryexposed some of them to concerns about high government debt.", "The preceding seven years had seen a very large increase in the stock of BBB-rated non-financialcorporate debt, which was on the ratings threshold for being considered investment grade. For bothUS dollar and euro-denominated debt, BBB-rated debt was around three times the stock of BB andlower-rated debt. Members noted that this debt would fall outside the investment mandates for someasset managers if it were downgraded to sub-investment grade; as a result, downgraded firms could facegreater difficulty rolling over their borrowings. There had also been a very large increase in thevalue of leveraged loans made to less creditworthy corporate borrowers, and a higher share of theseloans were ‘covenant-lite’. There had been a sharp decline in the price of these loans asa result of increased risk associated with the global economic contraction.", "Members were briefed on the resilience of Australian households in the current downturn. Aroundone-third of households with mortgages had prepayment buffers of three years or more. But a smallershare had no mortgage prepayment buffer and were more susceptible to financial stress. Housing loanarrears were likely to increase, but the extent would depend on the severity of the economiccontraction and the associated increase in unemployment. Loan payment deferrals would reduce theincrease in arrears rates for at least the following six months.", "Members discussed vulnerabilities associated with commercial property, particularly for office andretail property. A large amount of new office space was expected to be completed in Sydney andMelbourne in 2020. Members noted that demand was not expected to keep pace with stronger supply in thenear term and therefore it was likely that vacancy rates would rise and office rents would fall. Risingvacancies and reduced rent would be likely to lead to lower valuations, which would pose challenges forleveraged property investors and developers. Retail property was already experiencing rising vacanciesand falling capital values prior to the current downturn. The effect on retail businesses of the socialdistancing measures was likely to exacerbate these problems."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members recognised that the global economy was experiencing avery severe downturn as countries sought to contain the COVID-19 outbreak through restrictions onactivity. Many countries were likely to experience their biggest peace-time economic contractions sincethe 1930s and labour markets were very weak. The outlook remained uncertain, although if infectionrates continued to decline and restrictions were eased, a recovery could be expected to start later in2020, supported by both the large fiscal packages and the monetary policy response.", "The functioning of financial markets had improved over the prior month, although conditions had notcompletely normalised. Credit markets had progressively opened to more firms and long-term bond yieldsremained at historically low levels.", "Members discussed the very significant economic contraction that was taking place in Australia and thesubstantial, coordinated and unprecedented fiscal and monetary response. This response was softening thecontraction and would help support the economic recovery once the health crisis had passed andrestrictions had been removed. It was supporting incomes, maintaining employment relationships,underpinning the supply of credit to businesses and households, and keeping borrowing costs low. Membersnoted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, remainedresilient and was helping the economy traverse this difficult period.", "Members agreed that the Bank's policy package was working broadly as expected. The package hadhelped to lower funding costs and stabilise financial conditions, and was supporting the economy. Thepackage had also contributed to a significant improvement in the functioning of government bondmarkets, and the 3-year Australian Government bond yield was at the target of around 25 basispoints. Given these developments, the Bank had scaled back the size and frequency of bond purchases.The Bank was prepared to scale up these purchases again, if necessary, to achieve the yield target andensure bond markets remain functional. The yield target was expected to remain in place until progresswas made towards the goals for full employment and inflation.", "The Bank's daily open market operations were continuing to support credit and maintain lowfunding costs in the economy. To assist with the smooth functioning of Australia's capitalmarkets, the Board endorsed a proposal to broaden the range of eligible collateral for the Bank'sdomestic market operations to include Australian dollar securities issued by non-bank corporations withan investment grade credit rating. This change would bring the treatment of corporate bonds in theBank's collateral framework into close alignment with that of bank debt. It would improve theliquidity characteristics of some corporate bonds, helping to facilitate the smooth functioning of themarket. The proposed approach was consistent with the collateral frameworks of the major central banks,which accept corporate paper under repurchase agreements (repos), and it would not have a materialimpact on the Bank's risk profile. Members noted that the Bank would not be purchasing corporatepaper on an outright basis, but only under repos.", "In the various scenarios for the Australian economy considered by the Board, the labour market wasexpected to have ongoing spare capacity, and inflation was expected to be below 2 per centover the following few years. Given this outlook, the Board would maintain its efforts to support theeconomy by keeping funding costs low and credit available to households and businesses. As theBank's policy package had been introduced only recently, members assessed that the best course ofaction was to maintain the current policy settings and monitor economic and financial outcomes closely.The Board remained committed to supporting jobs, incomes and businesses during this difficult period andto assisting Australia to be well placed for the expected recovery."], "The Decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the elements of the policy package announced on 19 March 2020, namely:", "The Board confirmed that the target for three-year yields would be maintained until progress was madetowards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would beappropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself was raised. The Board determined thatit would not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment and it isconfident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target band.", "To assist with the smooth functioning of Australia's capital markets, the Board endorsedbroadening the collateral eligible for the Bank's domestic market operations to include debt issuedby non-bank corporations with an investment grade credit rating.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 1\">[1]</a></sup>"]}},

In contrast, a number of emerging market and low-income economies had yet to seea peak in the flow of new cases. Members observed that there continued to be material downside risks tothe global outlook, especially if infection rates were to rise in countries where the epidemic hadseemed to be under control, or if concerns about the virus or insufficient policy support were toconstrain spending.", "Measures of core inflation had eased in most advanced economies in April, and lower oil prices hadalso reduced headline inflation significantly. The effects on prices of the shortfall in global demandand the increase in spare capacity in labour markets had outweighed any boost to prices fromdisruptions to supply chains.", "China had been affected by the virus and responded with restrictions earlier than other countries, andwas therefore further into the recovery phase. Industrial production had recovered to be abovepre-outbreak levels and measures of traffic congestion had reached previous levels. In contrast,consumer spending and indicators of public transport usage had remained weak, even though mostrestrictions on movement had been lifted. Members noted that it was unclear whether this weaknessreflected ongoing concerns about the virus, a loss of income during the lockdown or more enduringbehavioural changes. The Chinese authorities had announced further stimulus measures at the NationalPeople's Congress in May, but the scale of the overall stimulus was still expected to be smallerthan during the global financial crisis.", "Exports from China had also returned to more typical levels by April, but at least some of thisrecovery appeared to have reflected exporters catching up with their backlog of orders. External demandwas expected to be weaker in coming months because the pandemic had continued to constrain demandelsewhere in the world. Consistent with weak global demand, business conditions were reported to be weakin a number of other economies in east Asia, despite the flow of new COVID-19 cases declining tovery low levels and restrictions in those economies having been eased substantially.", "The major advanced economies had recorded significant contractions in output in the March quarter, eventhough restrictions on activity had been imposed only late in the quarter. More timely data on businessconditions and the movement of people suggested that these economies had been weakest in April and hadstarted to recover in May. Members noted that measures of the movement of people had tended to declineahead of, or in some cases even without, explicit restrictions being imposed. This suggested thatvoluntary decisions by households and businesses had been an important factor. Exceptional fiscal andmonetary policy support had been deployed throughout this period and further support was beingconsidered in some of the major advanced economies.", "The contraction in activity in the major advanced economies had been accompanied by a very severedeterioration in the labour market. The exact effect on reported unemployment rates had varied widelyacross countries, depending on the severity of restrictions as well as the scope of policies, such aswage and employment subsidy schemes, designed to preserve employment and prevent layoffs; definitionaldifferences regarding whether employees who had been stood down without pay were classified asunemployed had also had a bearing.", "The number of COVID-19 cases had continued to increase in a number of emerging market economies,including India and Brazil. At the beginning of June, Brazil had the second-highest number of confirmedCOVID-19 cases after the United States. In India, the growth momentum had not been strong when theglobal pandemic was declared, although output had increased in the March quarter. The severerestrictions put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 had led to sharp declines in activityin the June quarter and a significant increase in unemployment to 20–25 per cent. Giventhe limited social infrastructure available to support unemployed workers in India, authorities hadbegun to ease restrictions in May, even as the number of new cases continued to increase.", "Consistent with the decline in global demand, prices for energy-related commodities, including oil,liquefied natural gas and thermal coal, had remained low. In contrast, prices for iron ore had increasedover the prior month, reflecting expectations of increased infrastructure spending in China andelsewhere. Members noted that the increase in iron ore prices had also been driven by supply constraintsin Brazil. Demand for coking coal – another input into steel-making – had not been asstrong, partly because India's lockdown had reduced an important source of demand forAustralia's coking coal exports."], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["Economic activity in Australia had contracted very significantly in late March and April, but morerecent data had suggested that it had begun to recover over the course of May. The March quarternational accounts, which would be released the day after the meeting, were expected to report thatgrowth in output had been slightly negative, which would be a stronger result than in most otheradvanced economies.", "While some categories of discretionary household spending had contracted in March, members noted thatthe large increase in retail spending was expected to have partly offset this, in contrast to theexperience of many other countries. Preliminary data indicated that retail sales had since fallensharply in April. This was consistent with a range of data sources, including liaison reports, whichsuggested that household spending had declined sharply in April but had recovered somewhat in May.", "The contraction in spending in late March and April had been accompanied by significant job losses,with total hours worked falling by 9 per cent in April. Timelier payroll data suggested thatthe pace of job losses had slowed towards the end of April. In some of the industries that had been mostaffected by the restrictions on activity, the number of jobs had stabilised or increased a little,suggesting that the total decline in hours worked may be less than had previously been feared.Nevertheless, members noted that, while this was a welcome development, it still constituted a verysignificant deterioration. Job losses had continued in other industries, which pointed to thepossibility of a more persistent reduction in overall demand than had previously been expected.Information from liaison with firms had highlighted that the pipeline of work was diminishing as firmsdeferred or cancelled investment and new projects, including in construction and business services.Business conditions in April had remained well below average.", "In April, an unusually high proportion of people who had lost their jobs did not actively search foranother job, so they had been recorded as having left the labour force and, as a result, theunemployment rate had increased by less than expected to 6.2 per cent. The share of workersrecorded as being employed but working zero hours had also increased sharply in April; while some ofthese workers were likely to have been supported through the JobKeeper program, others would have beenstood down without pay and may have become unemployed since then.", "While job losses and reduced hours for those still in work had reduced labour income, governmentsupport had provided a considerable offset. Households that were already receiving welfare payments hadreceived additional payments, and the JobKeeper program and increased JobSeeker payments had supportedincomes for others. In some instances, households had received more income than usual. Lower fuelprices, free childcare and other initiatives, as well as more limited consumption opportunities duringthe period of restrictions, had also reduced living expenses for many households. The implied increasein household savings had been consistent with the recent large reductions in personal credit andincreases in mortgage payments.", "Preliminary indicators suggested that business investment was likely to have been flat in the Marchquarter. Data on capital expenditure intentions had pointed to a substantial and broad-based decline innon-mining investment over the following year or so. Members noted that uncertainty about how theeconomy would evolve over the remainder of the year had contributed to decisions by businesses to deferinvestment and was consistent with information from the Bank's liaison program. Members also notedthat some state governments had been seeking ways to ease planning restrictions to boost investment.Mining firms' investment intentions had been revised down for both <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span>, but the data stillsuggested that mining investment was past its trough.", "Some indicators suggested conditions in established housing markets had stabilised in recent weeks,although turnover remained low and housing prices had fallen in some parts of the country. Informationfrom contacts in the Bank's business liaison program had reported that buyer interest in newdwellings had declined significantly over recent months as uncertainty about incomes and theavailability of finance had escalated. An increase in the supply of rental properties and the decline inpopulation growth associated with the closure of borders had contributed to a decline in advertisedrents. Some existing renters had also received rent reductions. Members noted that these conditions haddampened the outlook for dwelling investment once the current pipeline of work had been completed.", "Public demand had grown strongly in the March quarter. Members noted that the Australian Government andstate governments had committed to higher spending across a range of programs, including the JobKeeperprogram; these measures were expected to deliver significant support to the economy."], "International Financial Markets": ["Members noted that financial conditions globally had been broadly stable or eased a little further overthe preceding month. The improvement in market functioning had allowed a number of central banks toscale back their purchases of government bonds. The improvement in financial conditions since the acutemarket strains in March had been consistent with central bank and fiscal policy measures, a decline inCOVID-19 infections and the associated easing of restrictions on economic activity. Central bankshad announced a few new measures to ease financial conditions in recent weeks, but had generally shiftedtheir focus to refining existing programs or putting already announced programs into operation. Marketparticipants had not ruled out the prospect of additional monetary policy support in the period ahead,including the possibility of negative policy rates in a number of jurisdictions. However, seniorofficials from the Federal Reserve indicated that they were not considering negative policy rates in theUnited States, where such policies were likely to be counterproductive. In China, financial conditionsremained supportive, as reflected in the recent pick-up in bank credit growth, assisted by the targetedpolicies of the People's Bank of China.", "Members discussed the sharp recovery in the prices of risky assets since their lows earlier in the yearand whether this was warranted given the large decline in global economic activity and the highlyuncertain outlook. After falling by over 30 per cent in late February and mid March, majormarket equity indexes had recovered to be about 10–20 per cent below their recentpeaks. The ASX 200 had recovered about half of its earlier fall. Market analysts had projected amore favourable outlook for earnings than for overall economic activity, and equity prices had beensupported by lower interest rates. Members noted that various asset purchase programs and backstopfacilities put in place by central banks, including those of the Federal Reserve, had supported investordemand for corporate securities, with investment grade corporate bond yields declining to aroundpre-pandemic levels despite record bond issuance. For lower-quality borrowers, corporate fundingconditions remained more challenging.", "In sovereign bond markets, yields had been little changed around historical lows in most majoreconomies despite rising issuance as governments borrowed to meet spending commitments. Members notedthat yield curves in Australia and the United States had broadly similar shapes, being relatively flatout to three years and upward sloping at longer maturities, although US yields had been lower than thosein Australia. In emerging markets, members noted that conditions in sovereign borrowing markets hadimproved a little further, with policy easing by some central banks supporting bond prices in secondaryor primary markets. However, financial conditions remained tighter than prior to theCOVID-19 outbreak and concerns remained over a number of countries that had external financingvulnerabilities and/or had struggled to manage the spread of the virus.", "In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had depreciated against most currencies in the recentperiod. This included most emerging market currencies, although increasing tensions between the UnitedStates and China had contributed to a depreciation of both the renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar in theforward market. Members noted that the Australian dollar had appreciated further relative to theUS dollar and on a trade-weighted basis, to be around levels previously recorded in January. Thishad followed the earlier depreciation up to the middle of March, which had been larger than that of mostother advanced economy exchange rates. Movements in the Australian dollar over the course of this yearhad been closely correlated with global equity prices. While commodity prices and interest ratedifferentials between Australia and other advanced economies had increased in the recent period, theyhad generally been little changed since earlier in the year."], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["The package of monetary policy measures implemented by the Bank in mid March had contributed toaccommodative financing conditions in Australia.", "The overnight cash rate had settled over recent weeks at around 13–15 basis points, whichwas below the target rate but above the deposit rate of 10 basis points for Exchange Settlementbalances held at the Bank. This was consistent with large Exchange Settlement balances, which had alsoreduced activity in the overnight cash market, in line with experience in other countries followingsubstantial increases in central bank balances held by the banking system. On a few days in May,activity had been too low to support the publication of a transaction-based cash rate, and the cash ratehad therefore been determined by the Bank using the previously published rate, in line with thefall-back procedures. Market pricing suggested that market participants were expecting the cash rate toremain around current levels for some time. Other domestic money market rates were also at low levels.The amounts of the Bank's daily repurchase operations had remained well below their heightenedlevels in March, reflecting reduced demand and the high levels of liquidity already in the system.", "The functioning of government bond markets had improved, with bid-offer spreads returning to moretypical levels. Also, the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds had remained at the target ofaround 25 basis points. Accordingly, the Bank had conducted only one auction to purchase bondssince the previous meeting, with total purchases to date of around $50 billion. Members noted,however, that the yields on bonds with one to two years to maturity had risen to be a few basis pointshigher than the yields on three-year bonds. This reflected the lower level of liquidity in theseshort-term bonds and the tendency for demand to taper off when bonds are no longer in the basket for thethree-year bond futures and as they approach maturity. Should these developments continue, the Bankwould consider purchasing bonds in the secondary market to ensure that these short-term yields areconsistent with the target for three-year yields. 10-year bond yields had been stable around very lowlevels. These low yields had prevailed despite record issuance volumes, including the syndication by theAustralian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) of $19 billion of a new 10-year bond, which hadbeen met by very strong demand.", "Members noted that take-up of the Term Funding Facility (TFF) had been increasing gradually, with totaldrawdowns to date of around $6 billion out of a total funding allowance of $135 billion.Strong growth in deposits had contributed to this gradual take-up. Nevertheless, in liaison, banks hadindicated that they planned to draw upon the TFF in greater volumes over coming months to replaceexisting debt as it matures. Bank bond issuance had remained subdued in light of the strong growth inbank deposits and the option to use the TFF. Bank funding costs were benefiting from record low interestrates on deposits and wholesale funding sources. Issuance of asset-backed securities had resumed in May,supported by purchases from the AOFM.", "Activity in business funding markets had increased. Members noted that bond issuance by non-financialcorporations had picked up, with the Board's decision at the previous meeting to broaden theBank's collateral arrangements for corporate debt viewed as supportive of the market. The volume ofequity raised had been high as listed companies bolstered the capital position of their balance sheets.Business credit had been little changed in April. This followed the sharp increase in lending to largebusinesses in March, which to a large extent had reflected precautionary demand by businesses that haddrawn down their existing lines of credit in the face of economic uncertainty. In a number of cases,businesses had left the funds on deposit at their bank. Members noted that bank lending to small andmedium-sized businesses had been little changed, reflecting weak demand for credit and a cautiousapproach to lending by some banks. Interest rates on outstanding business loans had declined further inApril.", "Housing loan payments (which include payments into offset accounts) had increased sharply in April,consistent with many borrowers saving for precautionary reasons and the curtailment of opportunities forspending. These effects appeared to be larger than the effects of deferred loan payments and reductionsin housing loan interest flowing through to borrowers.", "Housing loan commitments (excluding refinancing) had been little changed in recent months, despitethe slowdown in housing market activity. Members discussed that this may reflect the effect of lags inprocessing applications lodged before the adverse effect of the pandemic on housing market activity.The refinancing of loans remained high as borrowers sought to take advantage of competition amonglenders for borrowers with low credit risk. Housing credit extended to owner-occupiers had slowed onlya little and growth in credit to owner-occupiers had remained stable over the six months to April. Incontrast, housing credit to investors had declined in April."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members recognised that the global economy was experiencing asevere downturn as countries sought to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Labour markets haddeteriorated significantly and there had been a sharp rise in unemployment in some economies. Over thepreceding month, infection rates had declined in many countries and there had been some easing ofrestrictions on activity. If this were to continue, a recovery in the global economy could be expectedto continue, supported by both the large fiscal packages and the significant easing in monetarypolicies.", "Members recognised that the Australian economy was experiencing the biggest economic contractionsince the 1930s. A very large number of people had lost their jobs or were working zero hours,household spending had weakened considerably and some investment was being deferred or had beencancelled. Notwithstanding these developments, it was possible that the downturn would be shallowerthan earlier expected. The rate of new infections had declined significantly and some restrictions hadbeen eased earlier than had previously been thought likely. However, the outlook remained highlyuncertain and the pandemic was likely to have long-lasting effects on the economy.", "Members agreed that the Bank's policy package was working broadly as expected. The package hadhelped to lower funding costs and stabilise financial conditions, and was supporting the economy. Thepackage had also contributed to a significant improvement in the functioning of government bondmarkets, and the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds was at the target of around 25 basispoints. Given these developments, the Bank had purchased government bonds on only one occasion sincethe previous meeting, although it was prepared to scale up these purchases again, if necessary, toachieve the yield target and ensure bond markets remain functional. The yield target was expected toremain in place until progress was made towards the goals for full employment and inflation.", "The Board recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal andmonetary policy in Australia was helping the economy through this difficult period. It was likely thatthis fiscal and monetary support would be required for some time. The Board remained committed tosupporting jobs, incomes and businesses and to making sure that Australia is well placed for recovery.Its actions were keeping funding costs low and supporting the supply of credit to households andbusinesses. This accommodative approach would be maintained as long as required."], "The Decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the elements of the policy package announced on 19 March 2020, namely:", "The Board affirmed that the target for three-year yields would be maintained until progress is madetowards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would beappropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself is raised. The Board determined thatit would not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment and it isconfident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target band."]}},

However, the number of new COVID-19 cases was rising rapidly insome countries, notably the United States and some emerging market economies. Restrictions had beeneased in some countries despite new COVID-19 cases increasing or remaining at high levels. Giventhese developments, risks to the outlook for the world economy had increased recently despite theeconomic data having been on an improving path over the preceding couple of months as restrictions hadbeen eased. Members noted that the sustainability of the economic recovery would depend in large parton health outcomes and ongoing policy support.", "GDP for the March quarter had contracted sharply in a number of countries. The severity of thecontraction reflected the timing of the lockdown in each country, its intensity and the types ofindustries and activities that had been locked down. The decline in activity in the services sector hadbeen particularly pronounced across countries.", "Members noted that survey measures of business conditions had improved in June across severaleconomies. Activity in the services sector had recovered more than manufacturing in June, but generallyremained weak. The recovery in business conditions appeared to have been strongest in the United Statesand China.", "A range of indicators pointed to economic conditions continuing to normalise in China. Industrialactivity and most property-related activity had returned to levels prevailing prior to theCOVID-19 outbreak. However, consumer spending and travel-related activity remained well belowtypical levels. In India, employment had recovered strongly, alongside an increase in newCOVID-19 cases. In general, high-frequency indicators in India suggested that people wererestricting all but essential travel.", "Members observed that household consumption in the June quarter was likely to have been very weakglobally. Consumers had been substituting away from services in favour of goods, and from internationalservices to domestic retail goods, in particular. In advanced economies, retail sales values in May hadrecovered most or all of the decline in April; in China, retail sales had been recovering sincenationwide restrictions were lifted in February.", "The contraction in activity in the global economy had been accompanied by a very severe deteriorationin labour market conditions. Members noted that government policies were offering substantial supportto labour markets around the world. A large share of the labour force in advanced economies wassupported by wage subsidy programs. Maintaining workers' attachment to their employers waspreventing a large increase in measured unemployment. Government support measures were also helping tosustain household incomes. In the United States, aggregate household income had increased in recentmonths, in part owing to increases in unemployment insurance, which had raised the incomes of manyunemployed people. Definitional differences had contributed to wide cross-country variation in recordedunemployment rates. For instance, in the United States the unemployment rate had risen most and thendeclined fastest because people who were temporarily stood down (and immediately classified asunemployed) had more recently returned to work."], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that economic conditions in Australia had weakenedsignificantly since the start of the year, but the downturn had been less severe than feared a fewmonths earlier. Consumer spending in May and June had been stronger than expected, and had also held upbetter than in most other countries. Manufacturing and construction activity had also been less affectedin Australia than elsewhere. Similarly, the contraction in the labour market had been less severe thanexpected in May. Nevertheless, the shock to the Australian economy would be the most severe since the1930s, and the outlook remained highly uncertain as it depended in large part upon containment of thepandemic.", "Household consumption had declined by around 1 per cent in the March quarter, and wasexpected to have contracted considerably more sharply in the June quarter. Reduced spending oninternational travel was likely to account for a material share of the fall in household consumption.Members noted that the restrictions imposed had also significantly dampened non-retail consumption,including of personal services, in the June quarter. While consumption of services, especiallydiscretionary services, had been weak since March, the value of retail sales, which accounts forone-third of consumption, was higher in May than levels before the COVID-19 outbreak. This partlyreflected substitution away from services where restrictions were applied in favour of goods such asfood, household items and recreational items. Vehicle sales had also picked up markedly in June, afterhaving fallen considerably in April. Across the states, growth in retail spending had been most subduedin Victoria; states where numbers of active COVID-19 cases were very low had seen larger increasesin retail sales.", "Imports and exports had both been lower in May, leaving the trade surplus broadly unchanged at ahistorically high level. The decline in imports had been broadly based and consistent with weakness inoverall consumption. While exports of resources had declined only marginally, members observed that thevalue of services exports had contracted sharply in recent months, with travel exports nearly halving invalue and transport service exports also declining. Around two-thirds of travel service exports areeducation-related, including the tuition and living expenses of international students, with tourismaccounting for the remaining third. It was noted that the full effect of the closure of Australia'sinternational borders would be evident in the June quarter rather than the March quarter. Meanwhile,consumer and business confidence, and surveys of business conditions, had picked up as restrictions onactivity were eased.", "Members noted that fiscal policy was playing a key role in supporting economic activity and the labourmarket in Australia and elsewhere. Domestically and abroad, this policy support had included directpayments to households and businesses, increased spending on health services, wage subsidies and loanguarantees. In Australia, government assistance – particularly the JobKeeper and JobSeekerprograms – was playing an important role in supporting household incomes and consumption.Mortgage payment forbearance, rental reductions and withdrawals from superannuation balances had alsosupported household cash flows in the June quarter and into the September quarter. Superannuationwithdrawals had been significant, equivalent to around 6 per cent of quarterly householdincome, with more than 3 million requests filed to date.", "Conditions in the labour market had been very weak, but not as severe as expected a few months earlier.Another large decline in employment in May had brought the number of people who had lost their job overtwo months to 835,000. The unemployment rate had risen by 0.7 percentage points to7.1 per cent in May. As had been the case in April, an unusually large share of people wholeft employment in May did not actively search for work and were therefore recorded as having exited thelabour force. Members noted that the employment-to-population ratio and the participation rate had bothfallen significantly and were at their lowest levels in many years. Underemployment had eased in May,albeit from a very high level, as more people resumed working longer hours. As with employment, totalhours worked declined again in May but by less than in April. The peak-to-trough decline in total hoursworked was now expected to be closer to 10 per cent than the 20 per cent declineexpected earlier. Payroll data indicated that job losses were reversing gradually in those industriesmost directly affected by the restrictions on activity, such as accommodation, cafes and restaurants.Jobs in other industries that had also been affected, such as business services, had yet to recovermaterially. Payroll data also suggested that the worst of the job losses was likely to have passed.", "Members noted that conditions in the established housing market remained mixed. Housing prices in somelarger cities had declined in June, though were only a little below recent peaks in the case of Sydneyand Melbourne. Housing prices in a number of smaller cities were broadly unchanged. Housing turnoverdeclined significantly when in-person auctions and open homes were banned owing to physical distancingrestrictions, but as these were lifted turnover had recovered somewhat. Conditions in the rental marketremained weak, partly reflecting an increase in the supply of rental housing in some areas. The reducedflow of new arrivals to Australia was also affecting some markets. Rental vacancy rates had increasedsharply in Melbourne and Sydney to just above 4 per cent. Soft conditions in the rental marketwere expected to weigh on rent inflation for some time.", "Investment activity in the residential and non-mining business sectors had been subdued and wasexpected to remain so for some time. Members noted that uncertainty about job losses had affected thedemand for new housing, and building approvals had declined, particularly for apartments. Liaisoncontacts had indicated that the recently announced HomeBuilder package had provided a boost to buyerinterest in the detached housing market, but less so for apartments. Non-mining business investment hadbeen weak prior to the onset of the pandemic, and indications from liaison contacts suggested it wouldweaken further in the period ahead. Uncertainty about the future path of the pandemic, associatedcontainment measures and the strength of the economy was significantly affecting investment plans.Non-essential investment spending was most at risk of a sharp pullback. While the turning point inmining investment was now evident, overall business investment was expected to remain weak in the periodahead."], "International Financial Markets": ["Members noted that global financial conditions had remained accommodative amid substantial policystimulus. Government bond yields had remained around historic lows in many economies, includingAustralia. This was partly because monetary policies were expected to remain stimulatory for someyears, and occurred notwithstanding a sharp rise in sovereign debt issuance. Sovereign bond spreads inthe euro area remained low.", "Members of the Federal Open Market Committee had signalled that they expected the policy interest ratewould remain very low until at least 2022 and that they would consider new easing measures, if required.Senior Federal Reserve officials had stated that negative interest rates were unlikely to be anappropriate policy tool in the United States. The European Central Bank, Bank of England and SwedishRiksbank had all extended their programs to purchase sovereign and/or private sector assets in June.Many central banks had also refined the various measures they had introduced to provide support forcredit, particularly for the business sector. Members observed that, at the same time, central banks hadcontinued to scale back their operations to support the functioning of financial markets because tradingconditions had largely normalised.", "Funding conditions for corporations had remained favourable for most borrowers, particularly those thatwere highly rated. Corporate bond spreads had narrowed a little further, notwithstanding record issuancein the United States and the euro area in the June quarter. Members noted that equity prices in majormarkets had recovered much of their decline earlier in the year, suggesting that market participantswere generally expecting a short-lived decline in earnings. However, volatility in equity markets hadpicked up more recently, partly reflecting uncertainty associated with the increasing spread of thevirus in much of the United States and a number of large emerging market economies. In Australia, equityprices had retraced around half of their earlier decline.", "Improved risk sentiment and the extent of policy easing by the Federal Reserve had seen theUS dollar depreciate against the currencies of most economies over recent months. Members observedthat a wide range of advanced economy currencies had returned to levels previously seen prior to theonset of the pandemic. This was also the case for the Australian dollar, consistent with commodityprices and interest differentials having been little changed over that period.", "In China, authorities had remained cautious about injecting further monetary stimulus amid concernsabout risk-taking in some parts of the financial system. Nonetheless, the authorities had continued toencourage banks to lend to businesses, particularly small enterprises, and the growth rate of overallfinancing had risen over recent months."], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["Funding costs for Australian banks had been at historic lows and the banks had ample access tofunding. The larger banks had continued to indicate that they would draw on the TFF in time as otherfunding matured. Given ample funding from other sources, these banks had not needed to issue seniorunsecured bonds this year. These bonds were also more expensive than the option of obtaining fundingthrough the TFF. Money market rates and rates on deposits had declined to low levels.", "Members noted that interest rates on business loans had declined to historically low levels. Largebusinesses had drawn on revolving credit facilities earlier in the year to bolster their liquiditypositions, but had since repaid some of those funds. Lending to small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) had remained little changed over the preceding year or more. While the supply of business creditappeared to have tightened, demand for new loans from SMEs had been low given the uncertain outlook andthat other policy initiatives had provided businesses with a source of funds.", "Large businesses had continued to tap capital markets, particularly by raising new equity. Membersobserved that listed companies in Australia had raised more equity as a proportion of the overall sizeof the market than had been seen in markets such as the United Kingdom and United States. Equityraisings in Australia had been more common than debt raisings, while the opposite had been trueelsewhere, in particular the United States and the euro area. An important factor explaining thisdifference was that the market for Australian corporate debt is smaller and less liquid than forcompanies in other jurisdictions.", "Interest rates on Australian housing loans had declined to historically low levels. Around half of thedecline in the cash rate since February had been passed through to variable mortgage rates. Membersnoted that refinancing activity had risen sharply as borrowers had taken advantage of lower rates andthe strong competition for lower-risk borrowers. Interest rates on new fixed-rate mortgages werenoticeably lower than on new variable rate mortgages, which had led to an increasing share of new orrefinanced loans on fixed rates. While some existing borrowers had deferred their loan payments,payments into offset accounts had remained high. This was consistent with many home loan borrowerssaving for precautionary reasons and having reduced opportunities for spending.", "Housing credit extended to owner-occupiers had continued to grow steadily at around the pace ofpreceding months, while housing credit to investors had continued to contract. Housing credit growthoverall was likely to slow in the months ahead, with commitments for new housing loans having fallensharply in May. Members noted that this was consistent with weak economic conditions and the softoutlook for the housing market."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["Members began their discussion by reviewing the monetary policy measures that have been used in otheradvanced economies and their applicability to Australia.", "Members discussed how the elements of the Bank's March policy package could have been configureddifferently, noting that there has been variation across countries in the design of these measures. Itwould have been possible, for example, to set lower, but still positive, interest rate targets and tohave purchased a quantity of government bonds above that necessary to achieve the bond yield target.Members also recognised that there was variation across countries in the design of term fundingfacilities and the range of collateral accepted in open market operations.", "After reviewing experience both overseas and in Australia, members agreed that there was no need toadjust the package of measures in Australia in the current environment. Members agreed, however, tocontinue to assess the evolving situation in Australia and did not rule out adjusting the currentpackage if circumstances warranted.", "Members also reviewed the international experience with other monetary policies and their relevance inthe Australian context, as they had done the previous year. These policies included negative interestrates, foreign exchange intervention, the purchase of private sector assets and also direct governmentfinancing.", "Members agreed that the considerations around these options, which had been covered in a <a href=\"/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-11-26.html\">speech</a> by the Governor in November 2019, remainedrelevant in current circumstances. All such options entail significant costs and involve very difficulttrade-offs and, for some policies, there are legitimate questions about their effectiveness. Membersagreed that negative interest rates in Australia remain extraordinarily unlikely. They also agreed thereis no case for intervention in the foreign exchange market, given its limited effectiveness when theexchange rate is broadly aligned with its fundamental determinants, as at present. Members reaffirmedthe importance of the longstanding principle of separating monetary policy from the financing ofgovernment, a principle that has served Australia well in practice. Members saw merit in these policymatters being addressed in an upcoming speech by the Governor on 21 July.", "In considering this month's decision, members recognised that the global economy wasexperiencing a severe downturn as countries sought to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Labourmarkets had deteriorated and there had been a sharp rise in unemployment in many economies.Nevertheless, timely indicators of economic activity had generally picked up, suggesting that the worstof the global economic contraction had passed. However, the outlook remained uncertain and would dependupon containment of the virus. Over the preceding month, infection rates had declined in somecountries, but they were still very high and rising in other countries.", "Members recognised that the Australian economy was experiencing the biggest economic contraction sincethe 1930s. A very large number of people had lost their jobs, with many others retaining their jobs overthis period only because of government support programs. Nevertheless, economic conditions hadstabilised and the downturn had been less severe than earlier expected. There had been a pick-up inconsumer spending in response to the decline in infections and the easing of restrictions across most ofthe country. However, the nature and speed of the economic recovery remained highly uncertain and, as inother countries, would depend in large part upon the containment of the virus. Uncertainty about thefuture path of the economy as well as the health situation was continuing to affect the consumption andinvestment plans of many households and businesses.", "Members agreed that the Bank's policy package was continuing to work broadly as expected. Thepackage had helped to lower funding costs and stabilise financial conditions, and was supporting theeconomy. Government bond markets were operating effectively and the yield on 3-year AustralianGovernment bonds remained at the target of around 25 basis points. Given these developments, theBank had not purchased government bonds for some time, although it was prepared to scale up thesepurchases again, if necessary, to achieve the yield target and ensure bond markets remainfunctional.", "The Board recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal andmonetary policy in Australia was helping the economy through this difficult period. It was likely thatfiscal and monetary support would be required for some time. The Board remained committed to supportingjobs, incomes and businesses and to making sure that Australia is well placed for recovery. Its actionswere keeping funding costs low and supporting the supply of credit to households and businesses. Thisaccommodative approach would be maintained for as long as necessary."], "The Decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the elements of the policy package announced on 19 March 2020, namely:", "The Board affirmed that the target for three-year yields would be maintained until progress is madetowards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would beappropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself is raised.

Case numbers were high in the United States and inseveral large emerging market economies. Some countries that had brought case numbers down to lowlevels, such as Japan and Australia, had experienced fresh outbreaks in July. In South Korea and much ofEurope there had been more success in suppressing the virus after restrictions on activity had beenlifted. Activity had picked up over the preceding few months, but signs of a reversal in mobilityindicators were emerging in some countries, particularly those with rising infection rates. Membersnoted that the global economy was likely to take longer to recover than initially thought and that thedamage to labour markets could linger.", "The global downturn in the first half of 2020 was more severe and widespread than had been seen formany decades. The extent of the contraction in each economy depended largely on the timing and scale oflockdowns and other health-related restrictions on activity. The contraction in activity in the Marchquarter in advanced economies was not quite as large as had been feared, other than for some euro areaeconomies. In the United States and Germany, GDP growth had contracted by around 10 per centin the June quarter, while countries that had successfully implemented targeted measures, such as SouthKorea, had experienced smaller contractions in activity over the same period.", "Members observed that business conditions in several large economies had improved in June and that thisseemed to have extended into July. Surveyed conditions in the services sector, which had been very badlyaffected during the lockdowns, had rebounded particularly strongly. Another feature of the recovery inadvanced economies had been the sharp increases in retail sales. Households had resumed spending, insome cases quite rapidly, after the end of restrictions. Household income support had contributed tothis. By contrast, industrial production had been much slower to recover. The more subdued recovery inindustrial production may have reflected a combination of lower expectations about future demand as wellas supply chain disruptions.", "Labour markets everywhere had been severely affected by the pandemic. Unemployment had risen and hoursworked had declined. Some countries, such as the United States and Canada, had initially seen very largedeclines in the employment-to-population ratio, which partly reflected workers who had been temporarilystood down being counted as unemployed.", "Members noted that the Chinese economy had recovered strongly, and by more than generally expected, inthe June quarter. Steel-intensive sectors were generating levels of output around or above pre-outbreaklevels, which was supporting Australia's exports of bulk commodities. Fiscal and monetary policyeasing in China had also been supporting the recovery. In contrast with advanced economies, consumerspending in China had been slower to recover than industrial production. This may have partly reflectedthe different emphasis of fiscal policy support measures in China, which had been aimed more directly atbusinesses and less at households compared with advanced economies. However, it was noted that weakglobal demand could hamper the recovery in export-oriented manufacturing, both in China and elsewhere ineast Asia.", "In India, a partial recovery in employment had been evident in migrant workers returning to their homevillages and obtaining work in the government's rural work guarantee programs. However, therecovery in mobility indicators had slowed recently.", "More generally, members noted that a key lesson from the recent international experience is that manypeople voluntarily restrict their movement if they are concerned about the coronavirus, even in theabsence of physical distancing restrictions.", "In summarising the international outlook, members noted that the GDP of Australia's major tradingpartners was expected to contract by around 3 per cent in 2020, before rising by around6 per cent in 2021, leaving GDP below where it would have been had the outbreak not occurred.Nevertheless, members agreed that the outlook was highly uncertain, and that the shape of the recoverydepended on containment of the virus."], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["Members commenced their discussion by noting that the economic downturn in Australia over the firsthalf of 2020 was the most severe in many decades: staff estimates suggested a decline in GDP of around7 per cent and a contraction in hours worked of around 10 per cent. Though verylarge, the downturn in the first half of the year had been smaller than predicted a few months earlierbecause restrictions had been less onerous and had been lifted earlier than expected. This had allowedan economic recovery to commence in May. Unprecedented fiscal and monetary support had also played a keyrole.", "Members agreed that the lengthening and tightening of restrictions in Melbourne, and the extension ofrestrictions to regional Victoria, was a setback to the recovery and would weigh on overall domesticactivity in the September quarter. In addition to the direct effects of the lockdown, there were likelyto be negative effects on the confidence of households and businesses. General uncertainty was noted asaffecting demand more broadly, beyond the industries or states most affected by the earlier restrictionson activity. Mobility indicators suggested that the previous recovery in activity had slowed across thecountry, including beyond Melbourne.", "Members considered three scenarios for the economic outlook, given the high degree of uncertainty. Thebaseline scenario assumed that the Stage 4 restrictions in Victoria were not materially extendedand that Australia's international borders remained closed until mid 2021. In this scenario,the recovery over the second half of 2020 was forecast to be more gradual than envisaged three monthsearlier. This was partly because of the reinstated lockdown in Melbourne, and partly because uncertaintyhad been affecting demand beyond the industries most affected by the Stage 3 restrictions onactivity. In this scenario, output was expected to recover somewhat over the second half of the year,bringing the contraction over 2020 to 6 per cent. Output was then expected to expand by5 per cent over 2021 and 4 per cent over 2022. These projections indicated that, bythe end of the forecast period, GDP was expected to remain short of the level forecast before thepandemic.", "The two other scenarios – an upside and a downside scenario – differed primarily in termsof assumptions over the evolution of the coronavirus. The upside scenario embodied a stronger and fasterrecovery on the basis of rapid progress in containing the virus in Australia, with no further extensionto the Melbourne lockdown and progressive easing of restrictions nationwide after that. In thisscenario, the faster pace of recovery was driven by restored confidence, which would encourage strongerconsumption and the recent run-up in savings being unwound at a faster pace than assumed in the baselinescenario. Much of the near-term decline in GDP would reverse over 2020-21 as consumption growthrebounded strongly in this scenario.", "The downside scenario assumed a globally widespread resurgence in infections in the near term and thatAustralia was faced with periodic outbreaks and ‘rolling’ lockdowns. In this scenario,consumption would fall further over the second half of 2020, despite ongoing policy support. With borderrestrictions remaining in place until the end of 2021, the recovery in services exports would bedelayed. As a result, GDP would not recover over the second half of 2020 and the subsequent recoverywould be slower, partly because of the damage to confidence (in addition to the direct effects of morelockdowns). This would affect consumption and investment even after restrictions were lifted. Membersnoted that the downside scenario entailed a much larger deviation in output from the baseline comparedwith the upside scenario, reflecting that the risks around the outlook were to the downside.", "In their discussion of the forecasts, members noted that in previous downturns it had been quiteunusual for consumption to decline significantly, as had been the case in this episode. Despite that, inthe present episode consumption by households was likely to have rebounded sooner and by more thanexpected a few months earlier. This was partly because restrictions on activity had been lifted fasterthan previously anticipated, which translated into a decline in hours worked that was less severe thanexpected. But it also reflected the substantial policy support for household income, which, unusuallyfor a downturn, had seen incomes for some households rise noticeably. Household cash flow had also beenbolstered by the significant volume of superannuation withdrawals. As a result, with income holding upand consumption having declined sharply early in the June quarter, the household saving ratio wasestimated to have increased substantially.", "The extension of government policy support would continue to support household incomes and assist therecovery over the following few quarters. While household income was expected to decline for a periodwhen this support was tapered, consumption would continue to be supported by higher savings, which wouldassist in smoothing consumption through temporary dips in income in the period ahead.", "In considering the substantial amount of fiscal policy support, members noted that around30 per cent of Australia's working-age population was receiving JobKeeper, JobSeeker oran equivalent payment. The JobKeeper program had been extended to March 2021, with tighter eligibilityrequirements and lower, tiered payments for full-time and part-time workers. The Coronavirus Supplement,paid to JobSeeker recipients, had also been extended at a lower rate from September. Combined with othermeasures and the usual automatic stabilisers, the net positive fiscal impact from the expected change inAustralian Government finances was equivalent to around 4 per cent of GDP in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span> and a further 5 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span>. State governments had also provided some support, mostly in the form ofincreased funding for public services and relief from taxes and fees.", "In turning to housing activity, members noted that prices in the established housing market haddeclined moderately in Sydney, Perth and Brisbane, and a little more in Melbourne. New property listingshad recovered to around similar levels in the previous year; however, the reimposition of restrictionsin Melbourne was limiting sales there and would continue to do so. New housing sales were more buoyant,supported in part by the national HomeBuilder program and, in the case of Western Australia, substantialstate grants for new dwelling construction. By contrast, rental markets remained particularly weakacross the country. This was partly a result of lower demand and the boost to supply from propertiesthat were previously rented to international visitors.", "Information from liaison with businesses and recent surveys indicated that the weakness in non-miningbusiness investment over recent quarters would become more pronounced in the period ahead. Investment inmachinery and equipment was expected to have been particularly weak in recent months given itsdiscretionary nature. Business liaison had reported that firms were prioritising their liquiditypositions in response to uncertainty about future demand. Many non-residential building projects thathad not yet commenced were on hold in part because of the uncertainty about future demand for suchspace. Work on projects that had already commenced was also expected to fall in the near term because oflimits on worker numbers at construction sites in Melbourne. Mining investment was expected to increasein the near term, but then ease as some projects were deferred.", "With international borders expected to remain closed for six months longer than assumed in May, theoutlook for services exports had been revised down. The profile for education exports was relativelyflat, and other travel-related services exports were not expected to recover until later in 2021; eventhen, they would do so only gradually. The outlook for other exports had been revised a little lowercompared with the forecast in May, reflecting weak global demand, heightened restrictions in Melbourneand the recent exchange rate appreciation. The main exception was rural exports, which had been reviseda little higher because of favourable weather. Imports had also been revised lower, reflecting in partthe effect on outbound tourism of longer border closures.", "Turning to the labour market, employment had been recovering since May, but weekly payroll data showedthat there was a loss of momentum in late June and the first half of July. This was most evident inVictoria, but could also be seen across the other states. Members noted that female workers had beenaffected disproportionately in the early phase of the contraction. This pattern reflected industryemployment trends, where female workers were disproportionately represented in industries most affectedin the early phase of the restrictions. However, male workers had been more heavily represented inindustries that had shed jobs in the recent period.", "Members noted that the contraction in hours worked had been less severe than initially thought.However, relative to earlier expectations, more of the fall in hours worked had reflected job lossesrather than people working reduced hours. This was despite one in ten workers continuing to be employedon reduced hours and a large number of full-time workers continuing to be stood down on zero hours. Thissuggested that the contraction in activity and employment was the result of expected weakness in demandand general uncertainty, in addition to restrictions on activity. It also indicated the recovery inemployment would be slower than earlier assumed.", "More broadly, significant spare capacity in the labour market was constraining wages growth; ahead ofthe pandemic, wages growth had been around 2 per cent. Information from the Bank'sliaison program indicated that the share of contacts expecting to freeze wages or to implement temporarywage cuts was higher than in the past.", "In the baseline scenario, the unemployment rate, which had risen from just over 5 per centbefore the pandemic to 7.4 per cent in June, was expected to rise to around10 per cent in late 2020 before declining gradually to around 7 per cent in 2022.The upward trajectory for the unemployment rate reflected moderate employment losses in the second halfof 2020 and an increase in the number of people re-joining the labour force. This followed a periodearlier in the year when an unusually large number of people who lost employment had left the labourforce altogether. An increase in labour force participation, which would translate into a higherunemployment rate, was expected to result partly from JobSeeker recipients again having to undertake jobsearch activities to qualify for the payment and partly from the progressive lifting of restrictionsenabling more people to search for work. In considering other possible paths for the unemployment rate,members noted that the upside scenario could result in a slightly lower peak in the unemployment rate,and a faster subsequent decline, falling to around 6 per cent by the end of 2022.Alternatively, in the downside scenario, the unemployment rate would be expected to peak at around10½ per cent, and decline very gradually to around 9 per cent by the end of theforecast period.", "In turning to the discussion on recent inflation developments, members noted that the2 per cent decline in headline CPI in the June quarter reflected unusually large declines in anumber of components, including child care and pre-school fees, petrol prices and rents, and the effectof rebates on some administered items. In underlying terms, the severe contraction in economic activityin the June quarter had resulted in disinflationary pressures, although prices of certain grocery andhousehold items had risen because of strong demand and constraints on supply. Around9 per cent of the CPI basket was not available to have prices measured for at least some ofthe quarter, necessitating the use of imputed prices. Members noted that the June quarter outcomes forchild care and pre-school fees, and fuel prices, would be largely reversed in the September quarter.However, the weakness observed in rents in the June quarter was expected to persist over the forecastperiod, given the slowdown in population growth because of lower migration.", "In discussing the outlook for inflation, members noted that significant spare capacity, highunemployment and slow wages growth would contribute to a prolonged period of low inflation. Thepossibility that supply disruptions could lessen disinflationary pressures was considered, but weaknessin demand was expected to be the dominant factor affecting inflation outcomes in the period ahead.Underlying inflation was forecast to remain below 2 per cent over the forecast period in eachof the scenarios considered. In the baseline scenario, underlying inflation was expected to reach atrough of around 1 per cent late in 2021 and to be around 1½ per cent by end2022. In the upside scenario, a more rapid tightening in the labour market was expected to contribute toinflation reaching around 1¾ per cent by the end of 2022. In the downside scenario, wherethe unemployment rate remained at elevated levels over the forecast period, inflation was expected totrough at around ½ per cent and increase only a little by the end of 2022. But theoverall message from the scenario analysis was that underlying inflationary pressures would remainsubdued for a considerable period."], "International Financial Markets": ["Members noted that global financial conditions had remained accommodative. Central banks in theadvanced economies had mostly left their policy settings unchanged and had continued to signal that theywould maintain highly accommodative monetary policies for some time. Central banks' asset purchaseprograms had contributed to the accommodative financial conditions, with market functioning having beenlargely restored. These purchases had assisted bond markets to absorb the significant increase insovereign debt issuance associated with the expansion in fiscal policy, thereby helping to keepgovernment bond yields around historic lows. Spreads between the yields of euro area periphery bonds andGerman Bunds had declined following the announcement of a €750 billion package of loans andgrants designed to support the recovery in Europe.", "Over the preceding month, the Bank of Canada had committed to maintaining its policy rate at theeffective lower bound until spare capacity had been absorbed and the inflation target had beensustainably achieved. The US Federal Reserve had extended the duration of various lendingfacilities.", "The costs of raising corporate debt had remained low. Corporate debt issuance had eased in July, fromthe record high levels in preceding months. Equity market prices had risen further and had recoveredmuch of their sharp falls from earlier in the year, supported by optimism around the development of aCOVID-19 vaccine and a general expectation that the decline in earnings recorded in the first halfof the year would be relatively short-lived. Members noted that the relative strength of US equityprices could be explained partly by the large weight in market indexes of tech-related stocks, which hadbenefited from an increase in demand for digital services and online shopping. By contrast, low oilprices had contributed to the underperformance of energy stocks. In Australia, equity prices hadrecovered around half of their decline earlier in the year.", "Financial conditions in emerging markets had improved a little over the prior month. Low and stableinflation had allowed for a further easing in monetary policies. Also, capital flows had mostlystabilised, following significant portfolio outflows earlier in the year. Indeed, currency interventionoperations had been scaled back and exchange rates had generally stabilised, although at lower levelsthan before the outbreak of the pandemic. Members noted that many emerging market economies in Asia hadperformed well compared with other emerging market economies because they had faced the onset of thepandemic with stronger economic fundamentals.", "In China, better-than-expected domestic economic data had contributed to a strong increase in equityprices early in July, while money market conditions had tightened, consistent with the improved economicsituation and the authorities' desire to limit the build-up of risks in parts of the financialsystem. While this had led to a broader increase in borrowing rates, financial conditions had generallyremained accommodative and broad measures of financing were growing at a slightly faster rate than in2019, as intended.", "Members noted that there had been a broad-based depreciation of the US dollar, and that thecurrencies of other advanced economies had returned to levels seen earlier in the year. The euro hadappreciated to its highest level in several years, supported by the recent agreement on a European Unionrecovery fund. The Australian dollar had also appreciated against the US dollar to be a littleabove where it had started the year. The Australian dollar had been broadly in line with its fundamentaldeterminants, such as commodity prices and interest rate differentials, which had returned to theirlevels at the start of the year. Despite further tensions between China and the United States, theChinese renminbi had remained stable."], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of domestic financial markets by noting that government bond marketshad continued to function normally alongside a significant increase in issuance. The yield on 10-yearAustralian Government Securities (AGS) had remained low. While the yield on 3-year AGS had remainedconsistent with the target, it had been a little higher than 25 basis points over the precedingweeks. Members supported the Bank purchasing AGS in the secondary market to ensure that the yield on the3-year bond remained consistent with the target. Conditions in markets for bonds issued by the state andterritory borrowing authorities (semis) had normalised in recent months.", "Activity in the cash market had remained low, reflecting sizeable Exchange Settlement balances, and thecash rate had remained around 13 basis points. Other money market rates had also remained low.", "Funding costs for banks had eased a little further to historic lows. Take-up of the Term FundingFacility (TFF) had increased as the end-September deadline for accessing initial allowances had drawncloser. Many banks had indicated that they would have taken up their initial allowance in full by thattime. Members noted that funding through the TFF was a less expensive option than issuing bonds. Thestock of bonds on issue by the major banks had declined, but remained substantial.", "Interest rates for business loans had also fallen to historically low levels because banks had passedthrough the cash rate reductions and the effects of other policy measures to business borrowers.Nevertheless, business lending had contracted, following strong growth earlier in the year, as largebusinesses repaid credit they had earlier drawn down for precautionary reasons in response to thepandemic. Meanwhile, lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many of which were operatingin the most affected sectors of the economy, had been little changed. Demand for new loans –especially from SMEs – had been low, reflecting the weak economic conditions and the unusuallyuncertain outlook, although the supply of credit also appeared to have tightened a little. Members notedthe importance of the JobKeeper program and other policy interventions for supporting SMEs through thecurrent difficult period.", "Interest rates on housing loans had also declined to historic lows; over half of the decline in thecash rate in 2020 had flowed through to variable mortgage rates. Competition for high-quality borrowershad remained strong and rates on fixed-rate loans had declined to be noticeably lower than variablerates; a larger-than-usual share of borrowers had applied for fixed-rate loans. External refinancing hadrisen sharply, consistent with the very low level of interest rates and offers of cash back to borrowersfor refinancing an existing loan previously held with another lender. Commitments for refinancing hadrecently been almost as high as those for new loans. Banks had announced extensions to their loanpayment deferral schemes, but were encouraging borrowers to make repayments if they could afford to doso. The balance in offset and redraw accounts had risen noticeably in April and May, but borrowers hadwithdrawn some of these funds in June; even so, balances held in these accounts remained large and abovelevels in March.", "Owner-occupier housing credit growth had slowed and investor housing credit had continued to decline,consistent with the earlier slowdown in housing market activity and the decline in loan commitmentssince March. While activity in the housing market and loan commitments had picked up in recent months,the flow of new commitments had remained well below its peak and was likely to remain subdued in theface of recent developments in Victoria and uncertainty about the economic recovery."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global economy was experiencing a severedownturn as countries sought to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Even though the worst of the globaleconomic contraction had passed, the outlook remained highly uncertain and would depend upon containmentof the coronavirus. Infection rates had declined in some countries, but were still very high and risingin other countries.", "The Australian economy was going through a very difficult period and was experiencing the biggest shockto economic activity since the 1930s. A very large number of people had lost their jobs, with manyothers retaining their jobs over this period only because of government support programs. Nevertheless,members noted that the downturn had not been as severe as earlier expected and a recovery was under wayin most of Australia. The recovery was, however, likely to be slower than earlier expected, with theCOVID-19 outbreak in Victoria having a major impact on the economy. Uncertainty about the healthsituation and the future path of the economy was continuing to affect the spending plans of manyhouseholds and businesses.", "Members agreed that the Bank's policy package was continuing to work broadly as expected. Thepackage had helped to lower funding costs and stabilise financial conditions, and was supporting theeconomy. There was a very high level of liquidity in the Australian financial system and authoriseddeposit-taking institutions were continuing to draw on the TFF, with further use expected oversubsequent months. Members noted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital andliquidity buffers, remained resilient and was helping the economy traverse this difficult period.Government bond markets were operating effectively and the yield on 3-year Australian Government bondshad been consistent with the target of around 25 basis points. The yield had, however, been alittle higher than 25 basis points over the weeks preceding the meeting. Given this, the Bank wouldpurchase Australian Government bonds in the secondary market from 5 August 2020 as necessary toensure that the yield on 3-year bonds remains consistent with the target. It would also stand ready topurchase Australian Government bonds and semis in the event of a recurrence of market dysfunction.", "Members reaffirmed that there was no need to adjust the package of measures in Australia in the currentenvironment. Members agreed, however, to continue to assess the evolving situation in Australia and didnot rule out adjusting the current package if circumstances warranted.", "Board members recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal andmonetary policy in Australia was helping to sustain the economy through this difficult period.

However, more recently the global recovery had slowed and become moreuneven, with infection rates rising again in some countries; further fresh outbreaks of the virus hadbeen seen in Japan, South Korea, some countries in Western Europe and New Zealand. This had led to atargeted tightening in restrictions, and some renewed signs of precautionary behaviour. Consistent withthis, mobility indicators had flattened out. Members noted that the future path of the global recoverywould remain highly dependent on containment of the virus.", "The first half of 2020 had seen the largest contraction in global economic activity in many decades.The extent of the declines in GDP varied significantly across economies, depending on the severity ofthe pandemic and the intensity of the containment measures. Some countries had experienced contractionsof around 20 per cent in the first half of the year, although the decline in output inAustralia was expected to have been less severe.", "In turning to labour market outcomes in advanced economies, members noted that total hours workedremained 5–10 per cent below pre-pandemic levels, despite having increased recently.The extent to which lower total hours worked had been accounted for by reductions in average hoursand/or employment depended in large part on the scope of wage subsidies and other fiscal supportschemes. It was noted that in the United States most of the decline had been in the form of feweremployees rather than lower average hours worked. This was because, unlike in most other advancedeconomies, income support in the United States had mostly comprised increased unemployment benefitsrather than wage subsidies.", "Members discussed the severe disruptions to global trade flows that had been experienced since theoutbreak of the pandemic, as seen in the sharp contraction in exports and imports in many economies.This had also been evident in Australian trade volumes. While the shock to aggregate demand had beencentral to the decline in global trade flows, disruptions to supply stemming from health measures hadalso affected the ability of some economies to produce exports. China had been less affected than mosteconomies in this regard, with production and exports both having rebounded strongly.", "Members noted that in China production had rebounded much more strongly than consumption, which had notbeen the typical pattern of recovery observed in other economies. Differences in the emphasis of fiscalpolicy support had largely accounted for this. In China, policy support had been aimed mainly atsupporting businesses and stimulating investment; income transfers to households had been modest. As aresult, fixed asset investment and industrial production had returned to pre-pandemic levels, whileconsumption had recovered at a slower pace. In advanced economies, household income transfers hadfeatured much more prominently in fiscal support packages, which had supported household disposableincome and consumption to a greater extent than production.", "Recent inflation outcomes around the world had reflected a combination of factors. In addition to theeffects of a large negative aggregate demand shock, these outcomes reflected a significant shift indemand towards goods, lower demand for services and disruptions to supply. The net of these factors hadbeen subdued overall inflationary pressure. However, prices for some goods, such as food, motor vehicles&amp; parts and household furnishings, had risen at a solid pace in some countries.", "Members also noted that large shifts in the demand for and supply of commodities had been occurring. Ofmost relevance to Australia, iron ore prices had been around multi-year highs. Demand for iron ore fromChina had been strong given that steel-intensive activity such as construction had bounced back quickly.Ongoing supply issues in Brazil had also supported iron ore prices. Gold prices had recently traded atall-time highs, partly reflecting increased investment demand in an environment of low global interestrates. By contrast, coal prices had been around multi-year lows, reflecting lower demand in India andelsewhere, and abundant global supply. In terms of key resource export volumes, members noted thatAustralian exports of iron ore to China had remained resilient in recent months."], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic conditions by noting that the contraction inJune quarter GDP in Australia was expected to be less severe than in many other countries and broadly inline with projections in the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. However, it was expectedthat the national accounts (scheduled for release the day after the meeting) would confirm the economyhad experienced its largest single-quarter contraction in the history of the quarterly nationalaccounts.", "Recent data indicated that non-mining business investment in the June quarter had not been as weak asearlier feared, particularly spending on machinery &amp; equipment. However, non-mining and mininginvestment intentions for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> had been little changed from threemonths prior, and had continued to indicate a very weak outlook for capital expenditure overall.", "Members noted that household consumption had contracted significantly in the June quarter, with thedecline in April having been particularly steep. Since then, consumption had started to recover, but wasstill well below pre-pandemic levels. Restrictions on activity had constrained spending in Victoria,with retail spending there much weaker than in the rest of the country. Business liaison and otherhigher frequency indicators suggested retail sales had declined significantly in Victoria in August.Members noted that spending on other services in Victoria would also be severely affected during thelockdowns. Overall, household consumption in Australia was still expected to increase in the Septemberquarter, but this would only partly reverse the contraction that had been experienced earlier in theyear.", "In their discussion of the housing market, members noted that prices for established dwellings inMelbourne and, to a lesser extent, Sydney had declined in recent months, but price movements had beenmixed elsewhere. The cumulative decline in established national housing prices in 2020 had been lessthan experienced two years earlier. Meanwhile, rental markets had remained weak. Rental supply had beenboosted by short-term and holiday rentals being brought onto the long-term rental market, while demandhad been depressed by the reduced flow of new migrants and a decline in the rate of household formation.Rental vacancy rates had risen recently, and members noted that downward pressure on rents was unlikelyto dissipate in the near term in either Sydney or Melbourne.", "Turning to the labour market, members observed that the increase in employment in July had beenstronger than generally expected, but not enough to prevent a rise in the unemployment rate. The numberof people who had left the labour force during the June quarter but were now actively searching for workhad increased. This was expected to continue through the remainder of 2020 as restrictions on activityand health concerns eased and mutual obligations under the JobSeeker program were reinstated. Measuresof labour underutilisation had eased, but remained very high. It was noted that around half of thecontraction in total hours worked had been reversed in preceding months, with average hours picking upmore quickly than employment. Many part-time workers had reverted to working their usual hours afterhaving been on low or zero hours earlier in the year.", "More timely payroll data suggested the number of jobs in the weeks up to early August had declined alittle, with a notable drop in jobs in Victoria. The recent decline in Victoria had erased much of therecovery in jobs between April and June. Outside of Victoria, the recovery in jobs appeared to haveslowed.", "Members observed that the 1.8 per cent increase in the wage price index over the year to Junewas the lowest rate of growth in the history of the series. In discussing the subdued private wagesgrowth outcomes in the June quarter, members noted that firms had responded more swiftly than inprevious downturns to the weakening in demand by slowing the pace of wage increases. In some industries,such as construction, professional services and some other service industries, a small number of largewage reductions had contributed to a decline for the industry in aggregate. Business liaison contactshad also suggested that firms were more likely to have instituted wage freezes than in the past, andthat it was not uncommon for senior managers and executives in some industries to have experiencedtemporary wage cuts. Wage and price pressures more generally were expected to remain subdued for sometime.", "Members noted the important role that fiscal policy had played in supporting the economy since theoutbreak of the pandemic. Income transfers to households from the Australian Government had provided asubstantial boost to household income and consumption, as well as to business cash flows. Members alsonoted that state and territory governments had played important roles in complementing these incometransfers in the period ahead, mainly by increasing direct spending on goods and services and jobcreation. Governments at this level had considerable experience to draw on in service delivery,employment and implementing direct purchases of goods and services. They also accounted for a largershare of public demand than the Australian Government. Members noted that debt levels relative to thesize of the economy were low for the Australian and state governments. Overall, public sector balancesheets in Australia were assessed as being strong. In an environment of record low borrowing rates andsignificant spare capacity in the economy, this meant fiscal policy was well placed to continue tosupport the recovery."], "International Financial Markets": ["Members noted that global financial conditions had remained accommodative, supported by substantialpolicy stimulus. Central banks had continued to emphasise that they would maintain the current easystance of monetary policies for some time and provide further stimulus if required. In August, theReserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) had increased the total size and extended the duration of itsgovernment bond purchase program. At the same time, the RBNZ had been considering a negative policy rateand an expanded term funding scheme.", "The US Federal Reserve had announced that, following a comprehensive review of its monetary policyframework, it would now pursue a flexible average inflation target and increase the emphasis placed onachieving maximum employment. Most commentators had concluded that this implied the Federal Reservewould maintain a stimulatory monetary policy stance for longer than initially thought and untilinflation was moderately above 2 per cent for a time.", "Government bond yields had remained historically low across advanced economies, although yields hadincreased a little over the preceding month. Market-implied inflation expectations had increasedsteadily to be around the levels last seen at the beginning of 2020. Accordingly, yields had declined inreal terms over prior months and were at very low levels, consistent with very stimulatory policysettings.", "Equity prices in major markets had increased further over August. This partly reflected the fact thatthe fall in corporate earnings in the first half of 2020 had been smaller than initially feared.Investors had also appeared to expect the declines in corporate earnings to be short-lived. The highlevel of equity prices had also reflected low discount rates, consistent with the low level of bondyields. Members noted that when total returns – which include dividend payments – weretaken into account, Australian equities had performed similarly to equity markets in most other advancedeconomies, apart from the United States, where equity markets had outperformed.", "Corporations across the major economies had continued to benefit from accommodative funding conditionsin debt markets. Spreads on corporate bonds had remained low and bond issuance had been relativelystrong in the United States. Business credit growth had been strong following the onset of the pandemic,but had eased over recent months. Members noted that there had been some tightening in banks'lending standards for business borrowers, and discussed the relative importance of demand and supplyfactors for business credit in the current environment.", "In China, the authorities had indicated their comfort with the current stance of monetary policy andhad re-emphasised their focus on managing medium-term financial stability risks, such as high leverage.The authorities had also signalled their concern about non-performing loans in the period ahead. TheChinese renminbi had been relatively stable, despite ongoing tensions between the United States andChina.", "Financial conditions in emerging markets had been relatively stable, particularly in Asia. Membersnoted, however, that some emerging economies, including Brazil, Russia, South Africa and Turkey, hadexperienced volatility in their financial markets and exchange rates in recent months; these economieshad existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities before the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span>pandemic.", "The US dollar had depreciated significantly against the currencies of other advanced economiesover recent months, including the Australian dollar. In part, this reflected an unwinding of the earlierappreciation of the US dollar related to an episode of financial market volatility in March andApril during which investors had sought less risky investments. The appreciation of the Australiandollar had been consistent with the increase in commodity prices, particularly iron ore prices, overrecent months. While members noted that the Australian dollar was broadly aligned with its fundamentaldeterminants, a lower exchange rate would provide more assistance to the Australian economy in itsrecovery."], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["In Australia, the Board's policy measures continued to underpin accommodative financialconditions. Reflecting the large amount of liquidity in the system, the cash rate had remained verylow, at around 13 basis points, and investors expected it to remain at that level for some time.Similarly, money market rates had remained very low.", "The Bank had purchased about $10 billion of Australian Government Securities (AGS) in August insupport of the 3-year yield target for AGS of around 25 basis points. Following the Bank'spurchases, the yield on the AGS bond maturing in April 2023, which is currently the bond with amaturity closest to three years, had declined to be closer to 25 basis points. Members noted thatthe focus of the yield target will increasingly shift to the April 2024 bond, which will become thebond with a maturity closest to three years in the second half of October 2020. Government bond marketshad continued to function smoothly, with large issuance by the Australian Government and states met byconsistently strong demand.", "Banks' funding costs were at historic lows and banks had good access to funding. Take-up of theReserve Bank's Term Funding Facility (TFF) had continued to pick up as the end-September deadlinefor drawing initial allocations approached. Banks had also continued to receive large inflows ofdeposits, another relatively low-cost source of funding. The increase in funding from the TFF andlow-cost deposits had been partly offset by banks not replacing wholesale bond funding as it matured;much of the decline in bank bonds on issue this year had been concentrated in bonds issuedoffshore.", "The cash rate reductions and other policy measures had flowed through to interest rates on businessloans, which were historically low. Members observed that, nevertheless, demand for business loans hadremained subdued, reflecting the weakness in economic conditions and the high level of uncertainty.Large businesses had repaid the bulk of the funds obtained from existing credit lines in March andApril, while lending to small and medium-sized enterprises had been little changed for some time.Interest rates on housing loans had also been at historic lows. Over half of the decline in the cashrate since February had flowed through to variable rates, and fixed housing loan rates had declined byeven more. There had been a large amount of refinancing activity, with a greater-than-usual share ofborrowers moving to fixed-rate home loans.", "Growth in housing credit to owner-occupiers had eased in recent months to around 5 per centon an annualised basis, while housing credit to investors had continued to decline. This largelyreflected reduced demand from borrowers, given the weak and uncertain economic environment and itseffect on the housing market. Housing loan commitments had increased over June and July, but hadremained below their recent peak. Payments into offset and redraw accounts had increased substantiallyin July. This partly reflected the early release of superannuation funds to some households at thebeginning of the new financial year, along with government payments and tax refunds. In locations wheremovement had been restricted, this had also reflected fewer opportunities for spending.", "Members noted that, in addition to weak demand for household and business borrowing, the supply ofcredit had also tightened somewhat since earlier in the year, reflecting the uncertain economicoutlook. Banks had been offering extensions of loan deferral periods where appropriate and generallyhad been encouraging borrowers to make repayments if they could afford to do so."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global economy had been experiencing anuneven recovery after a very severe contraction in the first half of 2020. Some economies with high orrising <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> infection rates had recently lost momentum. In contrast,economic growth had been relatively strong in China. The future path of the recovery was highlydependent on containment of the virus.", "The Australian economy had been going through a very difficult period and was experiencing the biggestshock to economic activity since the 1930s. Nevertheless, members noted that the downturn had not beenas severe as earlier expected and a recovery was under way in most of Australia. However, the recoverywas likely to be uneven, with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> outbreak in Victoria having amajor effect on the economy. Uncertainty about the health situation and the future path of the economywas continuing to affect the spending plans of many households and businesses. Wage and price pressuresremained subdued and this was likely to continue for some time.", "Members agreed that the Board's policy package implemented in mid March was continuing to supportthe Australian economy. There was a very high level of liquidity in the Australian financial system andthe policy package had helped to lower funding costs. Members noted that the Australian banking system,with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping the economytraverse this difficult period.", "Over the prior month, the Bank had purchased AGS in support of the Board's 3-year yield target ofaround 25 basis points, and members agreed that further purchases should be undertaken as necessaryto maintain the target. Government bond markets had been operating effectively, alongside a significantincrease in issuance. The Bank stood ready to purchase AGS and semi-government securities in the eventof a recurrence of market dysfunction.", "Members reviewed the operation of the TFF, given the uncertain economic outlook and that the initialallowance of 3 per cent of credit had to be drawn down by the end of September 2020. Theyagreed that the TFF had worked as intended and that, given the economic outlook, an expansion of the TFFwas appropriate. In particular, the Board agreed to increase the size of the TFF and allow drawing offunds up until June 2021. Under an expanded TFF, authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) wouldhave access to additional funding, equivalent to 2 per cent of their outstanding credit, at afixed rate of 25 basis points for three years. ADIs would be able to draw on this extra fundinguntil the end of June 2021. This extension would ensure that all ADIs continued to have access to theTFF after the end of September 2020. The availability of additional allowances associated with anADI's growth of business credit would also be extended beyond the end of March 2021 to the end ofJune 2021. This further easing of monetary policy would bring the total amount available under thisfacility to around $200 billion. This would help keep interest rates low for borrowers and supportthe provision of credit by providing ADIs greater confidence about their continued access to low-costfunding.", "Members recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetarypolicy in Australia was helping to sustain the economy through this difficult period. Members noted thatpublic sector balance sheets in Australia were strong, which allowed for the provision of continuedsupport. They considered it likely that fiscal and monetary support would be required for some timegiven the outlook for the economy and the labour market. The Board affirmed its commitment to supportingjobs, incomes and businesses in Australia. It agreed to maintain highly accommodative settings as longas required and to continue to consider how further monetary measures could support the recovery."], "The Decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the elements of the policy package announced on 19 March 2020, namely:", "The Board agreed to increase the size of the Term Funding Facility and make the facility available forlonger.", "The Board reaffirmed that the yield target for 3-year bonds would be maintained until progress is madetowards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would beappropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself is raised. The Board also reaffirmedthat it would not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment and it isconfident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target band."]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 6 March 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Lynne Cockerell (Deputy Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that GDP growth in most of Australia's major trading partners had risen to be above its five-year average over 2017 and that this momentum appeared to have been maintained into 2018. Global GDP growth had picked up to be around 4 per cent over 2017. Globally, consumer price inflation had remained low and stable, although there had been some signs of wages growth and core inflation picking up in several advanced economies that were operating above estimates of full employment. ", " Members noted that growth in industrial production and exports had eased in east Asia (excluding Japan and China) towards the end of 2017. In contrast, robust growth in Chinese industrial production had been maintained during 2017, supported by a relatively strong increase in exports in the latter part of the year. Some indicators suggested that conditions in early 2018 had been more positive in the manufacturing and services sectors of a number of east Asian economies. Members noted, however, that economic data for Asia were often difficult to interpret early in the calendar year, given the effects of the Chinese New Year holidays; the usual range of data on economic activity for China had not been available at the time of the meeting. ", " In China, growth in total social financing had slowed in recent months, with a significant switch from non-credit to bank-based financing early in 2018. This suggested the Chinese Government's policy efforts to contain financial risks were having some effect. Policy efforts to restrain the housing market also appeared to have had an effect, with housing price growth having slowed, especially in the larger cities. The authorities had announced a target for output growth in 2018 of around 6½ per cent, which was lower than the published rate of growth for 2017 of 6.9 per cent. ", " Output in the major advanced economies had grown faster than estimates of potential growth over 2017 and unemployment rates had declined to levels that were below those consistent with estimates of full employment. Other labour market indicators had also improved in a range of countries. In particular, despite ageing populations, participation rates had been stable in the euro area and the United States, and had continued to increase in Japan. While monetary policies had remained expansionary in the major advanced economies, monetary stimulus was expected to be reduced gradually in the United States over 2018. At the same time, fiscal policy was expected to be significantly more expansionary in the United States, given the tax and spending packages that had recently been passed. In contrast, fiscal policy in Japan was projected to be a little more contractionary as a result of the planned increase in the consumption tax in 2019. ", " Turning to commodity prices, members noted that strong demand for high-quality inputs to minimise pollution from steel production, as well as buying ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday, had contributed to increases in iron ore and coking coal prices over the preceding month. However, oil prices had declined modestly and other commodity prices had been little changed over that period. At the time of the meeting, there had been little change in commodity prices in response to the announcement of steel and aluminium tariffs in the United States. Members observed that the risks to the global economy, and therefore the outlook for Australia, would rise if other countries also increased trade protection. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the December quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting, although some partial indicators for the quarter were already available. Net exports were expected to have subtracted from growth in the December quarter owing to temporary factors that would unwind in 2018. In contrast, growth in consumption was expected to have rebounded from its low rate in the September quarter, consistent with the increase in retail sales volumes in the December quarter. The Bank's liaison with retailers and measures of consumer sentiment suggested that moderate consumption growth had continued early in 2018, although the value of retail sales in January had been relatively weak, particularly for smaller retailers and those with physical shopfronts. ", " Dwelling investment was expected to have fallen in the December quarter, driven mostly by lower investment in higher-density dwellings in the eastern states. Members noted that dwelling investment in detached housing and alterations and additions had fallen over 2017, but that investment in higher-density dwellings had been maintained at a high level over the preceding two years or so. Given the step down in building approvals that had occurred at the end of 2016 and the historically high level of residential construction work yet to be completed, dwelling investment was not expected to contribute to GDP growth over 2018 but nonetheless to remain at a high level. ", " Members noted that conditions in the established housing market had continued to ease in recent months. This had been most evident in Sydney, where housing prices had continued to decline across most segments of the market. Housing price growth had clearly slowed in Melbourne, and this had been most apparent in the more expensive parts of the market. Auction clearance rates had declined to around average levels in both cities. ", " Business investment was expected to have been higher than previously forecast in the December quarter, based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' capital expenditure survey and on work done on non-residential construction by the private sector. Although construction work done by the public sector had ticked down in the December quarter, it was still significantly higher as a share of GDP than it had been two years earlier. Early indicators of activity for the March quarter suggested business conditions had remained positive and capacity utilisation had continued to trend higher. ", " The capital expenditure survey had also provided the fifth estimate of investment intentions for 2017/18 and the first estimate for 2018/19. These data suggested that investment in the mining sector would decline in both the current and following financial years. The survey suggested that nominal investment in the non-mining sector would remain around its present level over the following year or so. Members noted that translating the data from the capital expenditure survey into national accounts estimates of business investment was challenging because firms tended to increase their expectations for capital expenditure over time. The degree to which they did this varied through the economic cycle, but members noted that in recent years the upward revisions had tended to be larger than average. In addition, significant sectors of the economy, such as education and health, as well as investment in intellectual property, were not captured by the capital expenditure survey. ", " Members concluded their discussion of trends in investment by considering the drivers of non-mining business investment in more detail. Total investment had been very high over the preceding decade, as a result of the mining investment boom. As this boom had come to an end, real non-mining business investment had trended up, but not as quickly or as soon as had been expected. One factor considered was the trend decline in the nominal non-mining investment-to-GDP ratio, which had been driven by the long-term declines of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, both of which are relatively investment intensive. At the same time, for the manufacturing sector, the share of investment expenditure on machinery and equipment had fallen, while the share of investment expenditure on intangibles, such as software, had increased. On the assumption that these structural changes would persist, but that the investment-to-output ratios for other industries would return to their long-run averages, this suggested there were some upside risks to the Bank's forecasts for growth in non-mining business investment over the medium term. ", " Members noted that a lack of ‘animal spirits’ following the global financial crisis probably helped explain why non-mining business investment had not been as strong as expected over this period. Differences in the paths of non-mining business investment across states suggested that negative spillovers from the decline in mining investment since 2013 were an important part of the explanation. Financing constraints may also have played a role. ", " Turning to the labour market, members noted that the improved conditions over 2017 had been followed by a further rise in employment in January. The unemployment rate was 5.5 per cent, around the level it had been over the preceding five months. Business survey measures of hiring intentions and job advertisements pointed to a continuation of above-average growth in employment over the coming months. The participation rate remained elevated and was significantly higher than a year earlier. The increase in the participation rate over the previous year or so had been strongest for women aged between 25 and 44 years and older men. Members noted that participation rates for these groups tended to increase when labour market conditions were strong and observed that the trend towards less physically demanding work and improvements in health outcomes were also likely to have contributed. ", " Wages growth had remained low. The wage price index had increased by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter and growth over the year had increased slightly to 2.1 per cent. Across the states, wages growth had risen to almost 2½ per cent in Victoria, and in Queensland and Western Australia had increased from the lows recorded during 2016/17. In contrast, wages growth in New South Wales had been steady at around 2 per cent for a couple of years, despite the strong labour market conditions in that state. By sector, wages growth had been rising in an increasing number of industries over the prior year. In particular, some (but not all) of the industries with a relatively high share of employees on individual agreements had seen wages growth pick up. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that equity prices had retraced some of the sharp falls of early February and volatility had declined. Overall, global financial conditions remained accommodative. ", " Long-term government bond yields had risen in most major markets since the beginning of 2018, but still remained low by historical standards. The rise had been most pronounced in the United States, where stronger-than-expected wages data and the announced fiscal stimulus had raised expectations for higher inflation and a faster withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve. Market expectations for inflation had also risen in other major advanced economies, though to a lesser degree and from a lower base. Members noted that yields on 10-year US Treasuries had moved above those on Australian Government Securities for the first time in almost 20 years. Short-term borrowing rates in US money markets had also increased since the start of the year, in part reflecting the significant issuance of Treasury bills by the US Treasury in early 2018. ", " Members noted that market pricing indicated market participants' expectations had risen to be broadly consistent with the median of projections of members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) from the December 2017 meeting, which implied three increases in the federal funds rate in 2018. Members observed that recent statements by FOMC members suggested there was some prospect of their projections being revised upwards again at the March meeting of the FOMC. ", " Following strong increases over 2017, global equity markets had fallen sharply in early February, associated with the reassessment of the outlook for inflation and interest rates in the United States. Equity markets had subsequently retraced part of this fall, although there had been some reversal of this in preceding days following the US President's statements about tariffs on imports to the United States. Australian equity prices had moved in line with developments in global markets over the preceding month. Members noted that, despite strong price gains over recent years, global equity market valuation measures were not significantly above average levels, reflecting higher earnings. They also noted that the sharp increase in equity market volatility early in February had been mostly reversed, and volatility in financial markets generally remained at or a little below longer-run averages. The spread between yields on non-investment grade corporate bonds and government bonds had remained close to the low levels reached before the onset of the financial crisis. ", " Financial conditions remained accommodative in emerging markets despite flows into equity and bond funds having reversed temporarily at the time of the recent period of equity market volatility. ", " Members noted that the US dollar had depreciated noticeably against most currencies since the beginning of 2017, although it had appreciated a little in February alongside the declines in global equity markets. The Japanese yen had also appreciated over the preceding month. After an appreciation since mid 2017, the Chinese renminbi had depreciated a little against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms in February, as the authorities restarted a program that facilitated some outflows of resident funds. In February there had been a slight depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms, although it remained within the relatively narrow range of the preceding two years. ", " In Australia, financial conditions for companies remained accommodative, with corporate bond spreads still low. In February, Australian companies generally announced that earnings in the second half of 2017 had increased, although some results were mixed relative to analysts' expectations. ", " Members noted that growth in housing credit had stabilised in recent months, after having slowed over the course of 2017. The slowing in housing credit growth had been most pronounced for lending to investors, in part reflecting the prudential measures introduced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority relating to interest-only lending, which is more common among investors. Members observed that housing loan approvals data pointed to some further gradual moderation in housing credit growth, although refinancing activity had picked up. ", " In relation to interest-only lending, members noted that most interest-only loans had terms of five years or less, after which borrowers could apply to extend the interest-only period or convert to loans with principal-and-interest repayments. Members noted that the profile and magnitude of scheduled expiries of interest-only loan periods over the coming few years was comparable to that of recent years. Members discussed the effect on disposable income and spending for households converting to principal-and-interest payments, noting that the increase in payments would be significant for some individual households. At the aggregate level, however, the likely increase in loan-related payments would amount to a small proportion of household disposable income and the effect on household consumption growth would be smaller still. ", " Financial market pricing continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged during 2018, with a 25 basis point increase expected in the first half of 2019. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that overall conditions in the global economy had continued to improve. The upswing had been broadly based and global spare capacity had continued to fall. Many advanced economies had been growing at above-trend rates and unemployment rates were below estimates consistent with full employment. In China, the authorities had continued to work on reducing financial stability risks and improving the sustainability of growth in output, and recent announcements suggested the current direction of policy would be maintained in 2018. The pick-up in the global economy had contributed to a rise in oil and other commodity prices over the preceding year. Nonetheless, Australia's terms of trade were expected to decline over the following few years but remain at a relatively high level. ", " Globally, inflation remained low, but there had been some signs of inflationary pressures building. Further inflationary pressures were in prospect in the United States, where fiscal policy was expected to be more expansionary in the context of limited spare capacity. This had led to some adjustments to financial market pricing, most notably an increase in longer-term bond yields in the advanced economies. Despite the increase in market interest rates, credit spreads remained low and global financial conditions continued to be accommodative. ", " Domestically, business conditions had continued to improve and non-mining business investment had continued to increase over the preceding year, while household consumption had increased only moderately. Employment had grown strongly and the unemployment rate had fallen over the preceding year. However, the improvement in overall conditions had not yet translated into a definitive pick-up in wages growth, which remained low. Forward-looking indicators suggested that spare capacity in the labour market would continue to decline gradually over 2018 and, as a consequence, wages growth was expected to rise gradually. ", " The housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had slowed in preceding months and conditions in housing markets elsewhere had been relatively stable. Tighter credit standards had been helpful in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets. Housing credit growth had eased, particularly for investors. However, household debt levels remained high, which contributed to the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for consumption growth. Members agreed that household balance sheets still warranted careful monitoring. ", " The low level of interest rates over 2017 had played a role in reducing the unemployment rate and bringing inflation closer to target. Further progress on these goals was expected over the period ahead, but this process was likely to be gradual. Over 2018, GDP growth was expected to exceed potential growth and CPI inflation was expected to increase gradually to be a little above 2 per cent. Members observed that, on a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar remained within its range of the preceding two years but that an appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than forecast. ", " Taking into account the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 3 April 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Michele Bullock (Assistant Governor, Financial System), Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Jonathan Kearns (Head, Financial Stability Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that domestic demand had grown by around 3 per cent over the year to the December quarter. Consumption and non-mining business investment had made significant contributions to growth. In contrast, there had been declines in mining and dwelling investment. GDP had not grown as solidly as domestic demand over 2017 because net exports had subtracted from growth. However, given the momentum in domestic demand and expectations that the decline in export volumes would be temporary, members noted that the economy appeared likely to record faster growth over 2018 than the previous year. ", " Household consumption had increased strongly in the December quarter and had been revised higher in preceding quarters. Members noted that following these revisions, consumption growth over 2017 had been more consistent with the strength seen in the labour market over that period. More recently, growth in retail sales values had been below average in early 2018. At least some of this was likely to reflect ongoing retail price deflation, owing to strong competition in this sector. Consumer confidence had declined a little over recent months, but remained above average. ", " Growth in household disposable income had picked up over 2017, partly reflecting the strength in employment growth over the course of the year. Income of unincorporated small businesses, which is attributed to the household sector, had increased in the December quarter. The national accounts measure of wages growth had continued to be lower than wages growth recorded in the wage price index. This suggested that compositional changes in the labour force had continued to have a dampening effect on household earnings. By sector, the national accounts measure of wages growth had picked up significantly for business services, but had fallen further for household services. At the same time, there had been strong employment growth in the household services sector, as well as for goods-related industries. ", " Members noted that year-ended growth in employment had remained strong in the first few months of 2018, although the monthly increases in employment had moderated. Nationwide, employment had continued to grow strongly in the household services sector, particularly in the health and social assistance industry. Employment in goods-related industries had picked up sharply over the year to February, mainly reflecting strength in construction employment. Members observed that migration flows from Western Australia had served to mitigate the effect of the end of the mining investment boom on the labour market in that state. The national employment-to-population ratio had remained at a high level, as employment growth had been strong enough to absorb growth in the working-age population, although not high enough to reduce the unemployment rate further. The unemployment rate had been little changed over the preceding six months at around 5½ per cent and measures of underemployment had remained at relatively high levels. Taken together, these indicators suggested that there was still some spare capacity in the labour market. Leading indicators continued to point to above-average growth in employment in the period ahead. ", " In the residential housing market, dwelling investment had declined a little over 2017 but was expected to remain at a high level over the following year or so, supported by the large pipeline of residential construction work yet to be completed associated with the increase in residential building approvals over 2017. Housing prices had declined further in Sydney and Melbourne. Members noted that Sydney housing prices had declined by a little under 5 per cent since their peak in mid 2017. Members also noted that declines in housing prices of around 10 per cent in some cities had occurred several times over the preceding 15 years or so. Over recent months, housing prices had been little changed in Brisbane and Perth. ", " Members noted that most components of business investment had increased over 2017, with the exception of construction activity in the mining sector. Private non-mining business investment had increased by more than 12 per cent. Public spending had supported growth in economic activity over 2017 and this momentum was expected to continue in the period ahead. Data on firms' capital expenditure plans and on the pipeline of non-residential construction work yet to be done also suggested that non-mining business investment was expected to grow solidly over the following few years. Consistent with this, survey measures indicated that business conditions had been around record highs and above average in all industries and states. ", " Export volumes had fallen in the December quarter. The decline in coal exports was expected to reverse gradually over the first half of 2018 as shipments from Queensland recover following a number of temporary disruptions. Rural export volumes had fallen as a result of lower crop production, which was unlikely to be reversed in the near term. Members noted that the spot prices of iron ore and coal had declined significantly since the previous meeting, reflecting concerns about the resilience of Chinese iron ore and coal demand after the Chinese New Year holiday period, although contract prices for coal had increased. Concerns that an escalation in global trade protectionism could damage prospects for global growth had also contributed to lower commodity prices. In contrast, the price of oil had increased in recent weeks. Recent developments in commodity prices suggested that the terms of trade for Australia had been little changed in the March quarter. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" As a backdrop to their discussion on international economic conditions, members noted that global industrial activity and trade had strengthened over the prior couple of years. They observed that although the tariff announcements by the US administration – and by the Chinese authorities in response – were unlikely to have a significant direct effect on global trade, the possibility of an escalation in trade restrictions represented a risk to the global outlook that needed to be monitored closely. ", " Above-trend growth in the major advanced economies had led to a further tightening in labour markets. Business conditions had remained around their highest levels in several years, despite having declined from their peaks in Europe recently. In the United States, fiscal stimulus was expected to support growth in output over the period ahead and was likely to add to inflationary pressures as the US economy encountered capacity constraints. Actual and expected growth in wages in the advanced economies had increased but remained low. Core inflation had also remained low, although it had picked up over recent months in the United States and Japan, and inflationary pressures were expected to build in the major advanced economies in the period ahead. ", " In China, the authorities had recently announced a growth target of around 6.5 per cent for 2018, which was similar to the target for 2017, and a continuation of policies designed to reduce pollution and manage financial stability risks. Members recognised that economic data for China were difficult to interpret early in the calendar year owing to the effect of the Chinese New Year holidays. Nevertheless, the available data suggested that private investment growth had picked up but remained low. Growth in industrial output had also been subdued, partly because of policies designed to reduce excess capacity and pollution. However, indicators of consumer spending suggested that consumption growth would continue to run above GDP growth, even though consumption growth had eased in recent years. Growth in total social financing had eased in prior months and housing prices had fallen in the largest cities where housing market restrictions had been most prominent; growth in dwelling investment in these cities had moderated. Nationwide, conditions in the housing market had been broadly stable. ", " In some parts of east Asia, output growth had been a little slower around the turn of the year, reflecting an easing in export growth in particular. However, more recent data suggested that domestic demand conditions had been somewhat stronger in early 2018 in the high-income economies. In India, growth had increased over 2017, driven by strong growth in investment; growth in exports of business and financial services had also picked up. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that, as expected, the US Federal Reserve had raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at its March meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had published upwardly revised projections for the US economy and a slightly steeper path for expected future policy rates than previously, partly owing to the US fiscal stimulus. The median of the FOMC's revised projections implied that the policy rate will reach a neutral stance in 2019, and move a little above the FOMC's estimate of the neutral rate in 2020. Financial market pricing suggested market participants expected a more modest increase in the policy rate over 2019 and 2020. ", " Members noted that long-term government bond yields in the United States and some other economies had risen over the preceding six months, but had declined a little recently, in part reflecting a slight lowering of inflation expectations. Share prices had fallen over the preceding month, reflecting concerns about international trade policy developments, as well as regulatory and company-specific developments in the technology sector. Australian equity prices had moved broadly in line with global markets, with prices of resources sector stocks having declined in response to lower commodity prices. ", " Members also observed that corporate bond spreads in the United States and euro area had risen a little over March, which was likely to have reflected investor concerns about trade policies and reduced demand for corporate debt relating to US tax changes. ", " Members discussed developments in US dollar money markets, noting the marked increase in the cost of borrowing US dollars at short terms since the beginning of 2018. The increase in US dollar short-term interest rates appeared to have reflected a number of factors, including a sharp increase in US Treasury bill issuance in the early part of the year and changes to US tax arrangements, which had encouraged US subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions to source more of their funding from onshore US money markets. In addition, demand for a range of money market instruments from a number of large US corporations was thought to have declined following changes to US tax arrangements. ", " Members noted that the developments in US money markets had flowed through to higher short-term borrowing costs in financial markets in Australia. In part, this reflected the use by Australian banks of funds raised in US markets to finance their domestic assets, in contrast to banks from other jurisdictions, which funded US dollar assets with the funds raised. There had also been some flow-through to short-term interest rates in a few other markets, though to a lesser extent. Futures pricing suggested that these pressures in US money markets were expected to abate somewhat over the coming months. ", " Members discussed the announced reorganisation of Chinese financial regulatory agencies, which was designed to strengthen oversight and reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage. The changes were consistent with greater policy coordination and a continued focus on reducing risks in the Chinese financial system. ", " There had been fairly modest movements in most major exchange rates over the previous month. The Australian dollar had depreciated a little further against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms, but remained within the relatively narrow range of the preceding two years. The recent depreciation had occurred in the context of lower commodity prices and interest rates in the United States having moved above those in Australia. ", " In Australia, corporate bond spreads had risen slightly over the preceding month, in line with developments in international markets, but remained at relatively low levels. Major banks' net bond issuance had been relatively strong over 2018 to date. Members noted that major banks' marginal cost of debt funding had increased a little over the preceding month, reflecting the higher cost of borrowing in short-term money markets related to the developments in US money markets. At the same time, there had been little change in retail deposit rates, limiting the overall effect on bank funding costs. ", " Growth in housing credit had stabilised in 2018, having slowed over the course of 2017, and the data on loan approvals suggested that banks had comfortably met the requirements of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) in relation to interest-only lending. Members noted that there had been a number of reductions in banks' advertised interest rates on investor and interest-only mortgages over the preceding month. ", " Financial market pricing continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period, with a 25 basis point increase expected in mid 2019. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " At the margin, global financial stability risks had eased. Stronger economic growth had improved banks' loan performance and underlying profitability. For some banks, the increase in profits had also reflected the absence of large asset write-downs, fines and restructuring expenses, which had affected previous outcomes. In China, the authorities had taken measures to contain the risks to the financial system emanating from the high level of debt and some higher-risk forms of credit intermediation, although risks to the stability of the Chinese financial system remained. ", " Low risk-free interest rates continued to underpin the valuations of many assets around the world. Members noted that a sharp increase in interest rates toward historically more normal levels that is not associated with stronger growth could see simultaneous price falls across a range of assets. In addition, investors had been accepting low levels of compensation for bearing risk, so a reassessment of this would accentuate possible price falls for risky assets. Past episodes had shown that such price falls could be large for equities and high-yield corporate bonds. ", " Housing markets had been strong in a number of small open economies that did not experience significant housing market downturns during the financial crisis, including Australia. Low interest rates had contributed to strong growth in household borrowing and housing prices in these countries. National authorities had implemented ‘macroprudential’ measures to curtail the associated build-up in risks. Members discussed these prudential measures more broadly, observing that the frameworks differed across countries and were still evolving. Measuring the effectiveness of these policies was difficult. Internationally they had successfully constrained the type of borrowing targeted, although in some instances there was switching of activity to other forms of finance. While governance arrangements varied across countries, members noted that the strength of the relationships among the different agencies involved was crucial to the smooth operation and effectiveness of these policies. Members noted that an important aspect of the arrangements in Australia was the strong relationships among the regulatory agencies, supported by the Council of Financial Regulators. The Reserve Bank and APRA had worked closely to address risks in the housing market. ", " Domestically, risks remained from the high level of household debt and the growth of riskier lending in earlier years, but regulatory measures had helped to contain the build-up of risks. Members noted that while the growth of household debt had outpaced that of income over recent years, household net wealth had continued to grow and, in aggregate, households' housing and financial assets far exceeded their borrowing. Members noted, however, that this was not reflective of the financial positions of all individual households. Nevertheless, measures of household financial stress did not indicate a high level of financial stress at present. Members also noted that the share of interest-only loans in new lending had fallen sharply and the share of loans with high loan-to-valuation ratios had also declined since the regulatory measures were implemented by APRA, which had further tightened lending standards. Housing prices had declined in Sydney, and to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Price falls had been larger for more expensive properties, suggesting that the regulatory measures, which would have had a greater impact on investors and therefore prices of apartments and cheaper dwellings, had not been the sole drivers of the slowdown. Members noted that a number of structural factors had also been at work. ", " Turning to developments in the commercial property sector, members noted that office property conditions had been strongest in Sydney and Melbourne, where the limited net increase in supply and robust tenant demand had pushed vacancy rates to low levels. Prices had continued to rise faster than rents, with sale prices implying very low rental yields for some properties, although overall the spread of commercial property yields to government bond yields had remained within its historical range. Demand had been strong from both domestic and international buyers. Rents for retail properties had not increased, reflecting the strong competition retailers were facing. In this environment, some retail property was being re-purposed to include a greater mix of entertainment and hospitality services or to incorporate a greater residential component. ", " Members noted that the resilience of the Australian financial system had continued to improve. Australian banks' profits had increased in the latest half-year period. Growth in profits had been driven by a wider net interest margin and a decline in bad and doubtful debt charges. Bank analysts generally expected the contribution of these factors to profit growth to dissipate in the near term. Banks' asset performance remained robust, with non-performing loan ratios falling for business lending and remaining low for housing lending. Members noted that loan performance remained weaker in Western Australia, reflecting the end of the mining investment boom in that state. However, they observed that the deterioration in loan performance had been relatively modest given the significant decline in economic activity and decline in housing prices in the state. ", " The capital ratios of Australian banks had risen further over the preceding half-year and were substantially higher than a decade prior. Further, a greater share of this was high-quality capital. The capital ratios of the four major banks were well above the current regulatory minimum and close to the ‘unquestionably strong’ prudential benchmark to apply from 2020. The increase in banks' capital ratios had reflected retained profits and subdued growth in risk-weighted assets as the large banks had reduced the size of their non-mortgage portfolios, which carry higher risk weights. Banks continued to hold a large stock of liquid assets, well exceeding the requirements under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio. ", " Members were briefed on the proposed revisions to the capital framework outlined in a consultation paper released by APRA in February 2018. The proposal would see changes in the capital required for different loans to make the capital requirement more sensitive to the risk of the loans, but would not raise the aggregate capital requirement for the industry. Members noted that the banking sector was the subject of several inquiries, the outcomes of which could affect how they operate. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that conditions in the global economy had remained positive in the preceding month. Output in the advanced economies was expected to continue to grow at above-trend rates, supported by accommodative monetary policy and, in the case of the United States, more expansionary fiscal policy. Over time, this was expected to lead to even tighter labour market conditions and further upward pressure on labour costs. Globally, inflation remained low, but was expected to increase. A number of central banks had withdrawn some monetary stimulus and further steps in this direction were expected. ", " In China, recent policy announcements were consistent with the trend towards a more sustainable growth path. Of particular note was the ongoing commitment to reducing financial stability risks through changes to policy and the regulatory structure. Members noted that the high level of debt in China and the significant share of financial market activity in unregulated sectors continued to pose important risks to the outlook for the Chinese economy. ", " Long-term bond yields had risen in the United States and some other economies over the preceding six months and credit spreads had widened a little recently, but financial conditions generally remained expansionary. There had been some tightening of conditions in US dollar short-term money markets, which had flowed through to higher short-term interest rates in a few other countries, including Australia. Equity market volatility had increased from very low levels, partly because of concerns about the direction of trade policy internationally. The Australian dollar had declined a little since the previous meeting. ", " Domestically, the recent data had generally been consistent with the forecast for a gradual improvement in growth. The outlook for non-mining business investment growth remained positive, supported by solid domestic demand conditions, the spillover from public infrastructure work and the pipeline of non-residential building work to be completed. Forward-looking indicators suggested that spare capacity in the labour market would continue to decline gradually over 2018. Consequently, wages growth was expected to rise gradually from its current low rate. Low growth in labour costs in combination with strong competition in the retail sector suggested that inflation would remain low for some time before also picking up gradually as the economy and labour market strengthen. ", " Conditions in the housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had eased, while conditions in housing markets elsewhere had been relatively stable. Tighter credit standards and APRA's supervisory measures had been helpful in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets. However, household debt levels remained high, which continued to pose an element of uncertainty for the outlook for consumption growth. ", " The low level of interest rates had supported growth over 2017, which had reduced the unemployment rate and brought inflation closer to the target. Further progress on these goals was expected in the period ahead, but this progress was likely to be gradual. Over 2018, GDP growth was expected to exceed potential growth and CPI inflation was expected to increase gradually to be a little above 2 per cent. Members noted that an appreciation of the Australian dollar would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than forecast. ", " In current circumstances, members agreed that it was more likely that the next move in the cash rate would be up, rather than down. As progress in lowering unemployment and having inflation return to the midpoint of the target was expected to be only gradual, members also agreed that there was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Taking into account the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},

Countries that had struggled to contain the coronavirus, and/orhad imposed severe nationwide lockdowns, had experienced larger contractions in output in the first halfof the year. Members noted that Australia's economic and health outcomes this year had comparedfavourably with the international experience.", "In their discussion of developments over recent weeks, members noted that a number of countries,including in Western Europe, were experiencing a second wave of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span>cases. Most countries had imposed targeted restrictions in response, rather than nationwide lockdowns ashad been the case earlier in the year. More broadly, timely readings on global activity and labourmarkets, including job advertisements, were pointing to a gradual recovery in the global economy, butwith significant spare capacity remaining. This was likely to keep underlying global inflation pressureslow.", "In turning to the recovery in China and other east Asian economies, members noted that exports andindustrial production had both recovered, but at different speeds. The extent of supply disruptions,differences in industry composition and changes in demand had all contributed to this pattern. Membersnoted that demand for China's exports had picked up. Elsewhere in east Asia, changing tradepatterns highlighted the varied nature of the economic shock induced by the pandemic. Economies mostinvolved in the production of semiconductors and other technology items for export, such as SouthKorea, had recorded a strong recovery in industrial production. By contrast, in those economies moregeared to the global automotive market, such as Japan and Thailand, industrial production hadexperienced a more subdued recovery."], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic developments by reviewing the very largecontraction in activity in the June quarter. Excluding public demand, expenditure had declined verysharply. Consumption fell by 12 per cent, driven by a halving in spending on discretionaryservices. Dwelling investment fell by 7 per cent and business investment declined by4 per cent. These contractions in investment had been less than expected. Activity in theconstruction industry had not been disrupted to the extent initially anticipated, while the accelerateddepreciation allowance had encouraged more business spending on vehicles and other equipment thaninitially expected.", "In comparing consumption in the June quarter in Australia with that in other advanced economies,members noted that domestic consumption of durable goods had been positive and stronger than elsewhere,while domestic consumption of non-durable goods and services had experienced large declines more inline with the experience abroad. Members also noted that indicators of consumption in the Septemberquarter had been stronger than expected.", "Members discussed the significant increase in household savings in the June quarter and theimplications of this for the outlook. The sharp increase in savings reflected the record decline inhousehold consumption, mainly driven by constraints on certain types of consumption owing to therestrictions on activity, as many services could not be offered for sale. At the same time, householdincome had increased, supported by a number of policy measures, including the JobKeeper program and theCoronavirus Supplement paid to JobSeeker recipients. There had been some substitution toward theconsumption of goods and services not affected by restrictions (such as home office equipment andhousehold goods), but the overall effect of the restrictions on activity, combined with large incometransfers from the government, had been to reduce consumption relative to household income. A higherlevel of precautionary savings also accounted for part of the increase in household savings. Inaddition, household cash flow had been boosted by the significant volume of superannuationwithdrawals.", "In discussing the implications of the increase in savings for the outlook, members noted that savingsbehaviour in the period ahead could differ markedly across households. Some people were likely toincrease their consumption (relative to income) as remaining restrictions on activity were lifted, whilehouseholds concerned about potential job losses would be inclined to maintain higher-than-usual levelsof savings as insurance against lower income in the future.", "Members discussed a range of other policy changes that had supported economic activity in recentmonths. Activity in the detached housing market had picked up, particularly in Western Australia, as aresult of the Australian Government's HomeBuilder package and state government incentives. Theinstant asset write-off scheme had also contributed to the stronger-than-expected outcome fornon-mining business investment in the June quarter.", "In turning to the labour market, members noted the substantial effect of the Stage4 restrictions in Victoria, while conditions in the labour market in other parts of the countryhad continued to improve. Jobs, employment and hours worked had recently declined in Victoria to aroundlevels previously recorded in May. For the country as a whole, however, members noted that thedeterioration in the labour market through the pandemic had been somewhat less severe than had beenexpected. The unemployment rate was now expected to peak below the 10 per cent levelprojected under the baseline forecast scenario in the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.Nevertheless, substantial spare capacity remained in the labour market and its recovery over the mediumterm was expected to be gradual.", "Members concluded their discussion of economic developments with a review of how businesses hadresponded to the pandemic. A recent survey indicated that some of the changes made by firms were likelyto be retained as a permanent feature of their business models, including, for example, the way thatproducts and services are offered, such as the increased use of online distribution channels.Information from business liaison contacts also suggested that, relative to the global financialcrisis, many firms had responded faster in reducing investment and employment, although this may havebeen because the shock to activity was significantly larger. Members noted that cost control and majorlevels of government assistance had supported the health of the business sector in aggregate, althoughthe future viability of some firms remained uncertain."], "Financial Stability": ["Members were briefed on the evolution of financial stability risks in the Bank's regularhalf-yearly assessment. An unprecedented policy response had quickly restored financial marketfunctioning in the period soon after the onset of the pandemic. But with the economic recovery expectedto take some time, financial stability risks were now more related to declining credit quality.", "Financial asset prices had rebounded from their lows in March, in part because of expectations of anextended period of low risk-free interest rates. However, there had also been a sharp fall in thecompensation investors receive for risk. This was despite uncertainty stemming from the shape of therecovery and a rise in political tensions internationally, as well as expectations of risinginsolvencies and defaults. For some heavily affected sectors, lost output would not be recovered quicklyand some businesses could face difficulty servicing their debts. These factors raised the risk of asharp fall in asset prices. Globally, there had been a decline in credit quality prior to the pandemic,which increased risks for investors, particularly those with leverage. Of note, there had been anincrease in the share of investment-grade bonds with a lower credit rating, and a substantial increasein the share of leveraged loans with few covenants.", "Banks in the advanced economies had started the year with high levels of capital and liquidity as aresult of reforms that had followed the global financial crisis of over a decade earlier. Their balancesheet strength had enabled banks to act as a shock-absorber for the real economy, rather than magnifyingthe shock as they had during the global financial crisis. Policy actions, including decisions that loanswith repayment deferrals be treated as performing and restrictions on shareholder pay-outs, hadcontributed to banks' capital ratios remaining high. However, in some jurisdictions, banks hadentered the period with structurally low profitability; this would make it more difficult if they neededto raise equity in stressed times and would be likely to make those banks more cautious in expandingtheir lending. These risks were particularly high for those European countries where low bankprofitability occurred in tandem with high levels of government debt, since a fall in sovereign debtvalues would erode bank capital and lead investors to question the government's ability to supporttroubled banks.", "Members noted that many businesses in Australia had increased their cash buffers in 2020. Prior to thepandemic, firm-level data suggested that around half of businesses had enough cash to pay their expensesfor less than one month. However, by mid 2020, support measures provided by the government,landlords and lenders had boosted businesses' cash buffers, with estimates suggesting that asignificant share of businesses could cover at least six months of expenses. Listed companies had largerbuffers than private companies and unincorporated businesses. Members also noted that, for somebusinesses, their best survival strategy would be to hibernate until economic conditions hadsufficiently normalised. Business failures had been substantially lower in 2020 than in preceding yearsbecause of insolvency moratoriums and the various support measures. However, business failures wereexpected to rise, particularly for small businesses.", "Risks for some types of commercial property were high as declining demand had increased the chance offalling property values. Retail property vacancy rates had been rising prior to 2020 because ofstructural changes in the retail sector. Efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus hadaccelerated this trend in the first half of 2020. Office vacancy rates had also increased given thedecline in economic activity, although this had been from low levels of vacancies, particularly inSydney and Melbourne. Nevertheless, an increase in office supply coupled with uncertainty about futureworking conditions (and therefore office demand) increased the risk of falls in office property prices,particularly for secondary-grade buildings. Members noted that demand for industrial property had beenstrong prior to the pandemic, driven by increasing e-commerce, and that, if anything, this had sincebeen reinforced. Banks' direct commercial property exposures had declined since the globalfinancial crisis, although members noted there was uncertainty about the size of banks' indirectexposures through lending to non-banks that subsequently lent to property investors, as well as the useof commercial property as collateral for business lending.", "Many households had increased their liquidity buffers in 2020. This reflected a reduction in livingexpenses and, more so for some renting households, an increase in income from government payments. Inthe early 1990s' recession the unemployment rate had increased by less for households withmortgages than for households that rent, but in 2020 the unemployment rate had increased by a similaramount for both types of households. The unemployment rate for households with mortgages, nevertheless,remained lower than for renters. Members noted that repayments had been deferred on around7 per cent of housing loans, a slight decline from the peak earlier in the year. Loans with arepayment deferral were more likely to have a higher loan-to-valuation ratio and to have been extendedto those employed in industries relatively more adversely affected by the pandemic. Demand for housinghad moderated slightly, with only relatively small falls in housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne.Housing prices had increased in all other cities in September. Most borrowers for housing had largeamounts of equity in their properties, with only 3 per cent of borrowers estimated to havenegative equity.", "Banks in Australia had increased their provisions in the first half of 2020 to account for expectedfuture losses resulting from the pandemic. Banks' non-performing loan ratio was low, but had beenincreasing gradually since the start of the year. This had reflected a decline in credit quality forhousing loans to both owner-occupiers and investors. The increase in the non-performing loan ratio forpersonal lending was partly due to a reduction in outstanding personal credit, particularly credit cardbalances, as those borrowers in a stronger financial position had been repaying their debts. Both largeand small banks had high levels of capital. Stress tests of the banks indicated they had sufficientcapital to withstand an economic contraction that was far more severe than expected. Members noted that,given their strong balance sheets, banks were well placed to continue lending and thereby support theeconomic recovery."], "International Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of international financial markets by noting that financialconditions had continued to support the global economy over the preceding month. Central banks in theadvanced economies had left their policy rates unchanged, but financial market prices implied that somecentral banks were expected to ease policy further. In the case of some central banks, such as theEuropean Central Bank, this was in response to weaker-than-expected economic conditions and risingdownside risks to the economic outlook. In the case of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Bank ofEngland, the expectation of further easing had followed guidance from these central banks that they werepreparing for the possibility of negative policy rates.", "Central banks in the advanced economies had also continued to purchase substantial amounts ofgovernment debt in the secondary markets. At its September meeting, the US Federal Reserve had left thepace of asset purchases unchanged, but acknowledged that asset purchases were being undertaken to fosteraccommodative financial conditions, in addition to sustaining market functioning.", "Low policy rates and large asset purchase programs had contributed to sovereign bond yields in majoradvanced economies remaining low and stable. Members noted that longer-term yields for AustralianGovernment Securities (AGS) had been higher than in almost all other advanced economies, although therehad been some narrowing of the interest rate differential between Australia and other major advancedeconomies in recent weeks. The recent narrowing in yield differentials had contributed to a broad-baseddepreciation of the Australian dollar over the previous month, as had an increase in risk aversion and adecline in some commodity prices, which had been related to rising concerns about the prospects forglobal output growth. Nevertheless, the Australian dollar had remained just below its peak of theprevious few years. While members noted that the Australian dollar exchange rate was broadly consistentwith its fundamental determinants, a lower exchange rate would provide more stimulus to the Australianeconomy in the recovery phase.", "In emerging markets, financial conditions had also been supported by accommodative policy settings.Financial conditions in China had remained broadly accommodative, although they had tightened in recentmonths together with the economic recovery there. Growth in total social financing had remained strongerthan the previous year, consistent with the stated goal of the authorities. The Chinese renminbi hadappreciated over the preceding couple of months. However, other emerging market economies had remainedvulnerable to a further deterioration in their economic outlook because of the ongoing increase in <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases, pre-existing macroeconomic fragilities and a reliance on externalfinancing, which limited the scope for additional fiscal stimulus."], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["Domestically, the Bank's policy measures had continued to underpin accommodative financialconditions. Financial market prices implied that investors now expected the cash rate to decline tobelow 10 basis points, compared with earlier expectations that the cash rate would remain ataround its current level of 13 basis points for some time. Money market rates and bond yields hadalso declined in line with this change in market expectations.", "The Bank had purchased bonds in the secondary market in early September in support of the 3-year AGSyield target. Subsequently, the 3-year yield had moved well below 20 basis points as marketparticipants' expectations for further policy actions by the Bank had increased. Members notedthat investor demand for recent AGS issuance had been strong and that spreads of semi-government yieldsto AGS had remained narrow.", "Members also noted that banks had drawn down nearly all of their initial allowances of$84 billion from the Term Funding Facility by the 30 September deadline. This was supportinghistorically low bank funding costs. From the start of October, banks were able to draw on the newsupplementary allowance of $57 billion in total, as well as additional allowances, which amountedto $59 billion at the time of the meeting.", "Interest rates on housing and business loans remained historically low. Business credit had decreaseda little further in August as large businesses continued to repay revolving credit facilities, whichthey had drawn down in March and April for precautionary purposes. Members noted that, notwithstandingthis, large businesses had issued more corporate bonds over the year to date than the average of recentyears, as had been the case in other economies. Large businesses had also increased their credit limitsat banks. Meanwhile, lending to small and medium-sized businesses had remained little changed. Weaknessin business credit growth appeared to be driven mostly by lower demand in response to weak economicconditions and the uncertain environment, although the availability of credit to businesses had alsotightened a little following the onset of the pandemic.", "Growth in credit for owner-occupied housing had remained steady in recent months. Commitments forhousing loans to owner-occupiers had picked up further in August across all states, consistent with ageneral increase in activity in the housing market. By contrast, credit to investors in housing hadremained weak, although it had stopped declining in August. Following an earlier tightening in responseto the pandemic, more recently constraints on the supply of housing finance had eased slightly."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global economy was gradually recovering,but that most economies were still some way from the output levels that prevailed before the pandemic.The continuation of the recovery was dependent on containment of the virus. The recovery was mostadvanced in China, where conditions had improved substantially over preceding months. Globally,inflation remained very low and below central bank targets.", "The Australian economy had experienced the largest peacetime economic contraction since the 1930s.Nevertheless, members noted that the decline in output in the June quarter had been smaller than in mostother countries and smaller than had been expected. A recovery was under way in most of Australia,although the second <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> outbreak in Victoria and associatedrestrictions on activity had been having a major effect on the economy in that state. Labour marketconditions had improved somewhat over the preceding few months, with the unemployment rate likely topeak at a lower rate than earlier expected. Nevertheless, both unemployment and underemployment wereexpected to remain high for an extended period. The recovery was likely to be slow and uneven, andinflation was expected to remain subdued for some time.", "Members agreed that the Board's policy package was continuing to support the Australian economy byunderpinning very low borrowing costs and the supply of credit to households and businesses. There was avery high level of liquidity in the Australian financial system and the policy package had helped tolower funding costs. Authorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $83 billion of low-costfunding through the Term Funding Facility and had access to a further $114 billion under thefacility. Members noted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital and liquiditybuffers, had remained resilient and was helping the economy traverse the current difficult period.", "Over the prior month, the Bank had purchased AGS in support of the Board's 3-year yield target ofaround 25 basis points. Government bond markets had been operating effectively, also during aperiod of significant increase in issuance. The Bank stood ready to purchase AGS and semi-governmentsecurities in the event of a recurrence of market dysfunction.", "Members recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetarypolicy in Australia was helping to sustain the economy through the current period. Members noted thatpublic sector balance sheets in Australia were strong, which allowed for the provision of continuedsupport, with the Australian Government Budget for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> to beannounced that evening. The Secretary to the Australian Treasury briefed members on the main features ofthe Budget. Members considered that fiscal and monetary support would be required for some time giventhe outlook for the economy and the prospect of high unemployment.", "The Board discussed the case for additional monetary easing to support jobs and the overall economy. Asin previous meetings, members discussed the options of reducing the targets for the cash rate and the3-year yield towards zero, without going negative, and buying government bonds further along the yieldcurve. These options would have the effect of further easing financial conditions in Australia.", "In considering the case for further monetary measures, members discussed monetary policy developmentsabroad and their implications for financial conditions in Australia, through the yield curve and theexchange rate. Members noted that the larger balance sheet expansions by other central banks relative tothe Reserve Bank was contributing to lower sovereign yields in most other advanced economies than inAustralia. Members discussed the implications of this for the Australian dollar exchange rate.", "Members also discussed how much traction further monetary easing might obtain in terms of bettereconomic outcomes. They recognised that some parts of the transmission of easier monetary policy hadbeen impaired as a result of the restrictions on activity in parts of the economy. However, as theeconomy opens up, members considered it reasonable to expect that further monetary easing would gainmore traction than had been the case earlier. Members also considered the effect of lower interest rateson community confidence and on those people who rely on interest income.", "Members discussed the possible effect of further monetary easing on financial stability. A furthereasing would help to reduce financial stability risks by strengthening the economy and private sectorbalance sheets, thereby lowering the number of non-performing loans. This benefit would need to beweighed against any additional risks as investors search for yield in the low interest rate environment,including those resulting from higher leverage and higher asset prices, particularly in the housingmarket. On balance, the Board thought it likely that there were greater financial stability benefitsfrom a stronger economy, while acknowledging that risks in asset markets had to be closelymonitored.", "The Board also considered the nature of the forward guidance regarding the cash rate. Over recentmonths, the Board had communicated that it would ‘not increase the cash rate target untilprogress is being made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation will be sustainablywithin the 2–3 per cent target band’. Given the higher level of uncertaintyabout inflation dynamics in the current economic environment, the Board agreed to place more weight onactual, not forecast, inflation in its decision-making. Members indicated that they would also like tosee more than just progress towards full employment before considering an increase in the cash rate, asthe Board views addressing the high rate of unemployment as an important national priority. Membersrecognised that while inflation can move up and down for a range of reasons, achieving inflationconsistent with the target is likely to require a return to a tight labour market.", "Members agreed that this evolution in forward guidance would best be announced in a speech by theGovernor on 15 October. This would allow for greater context to be provided than was possible inthe post-meeting statement. The Board remains of the view that it would be appropriate to remove theyield target before the cash rate itself is raised.", "The Board affirmed its commitment to supporting jobs, incomes and businesses in Australia. Its actions,including the decision in September to expand the Term Funding Facility, were keeping funding costs lowand assisting with the supply of credit. It agreed to maintain highly accommodative policy settings aslong as required and to continue to consider how additional monetary easing could support jobs as theeconomy opens up further."], "The Decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:"]}},
{"Date": ["Adelaide – 1 May 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Bradley Jones (Head, International Department), Adam Cagliarini (Representative, China) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the outlook for the economy had not changed materially over the preceding three months. Stronger growth was expected over the following couple of years, which would reduce spare capacity in the economy and lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate. This, in turn, was expected to lead to a gradual pick-up in wages growth and inflation. ", "The inflation data for the March quarter had been in line with the Bank's expectations. Inflation had been ½ per cent in the quarter and close to 2 per cent over the year in both headline and underlying terms. The largest increases in prices over the year had been for tobacco, following excise increases, and utilities, reflecting higher electricity prices. The prices of tradable goods and services, excluding volatile items, had been declining since late 2016, despite the relative stability in the exchange rate over the preceding few years. Members observed that this was likely to reflect ongoing strong competition in the retail sector. Non-tradables inflation had remained a little above 3 per cent in year-ended terms. While non-tradables inflation had picked up over the preceding year, it remained lower than its average over the first decade of the 21st century. Members observed that spare capacity in the labour market and associated low wages growth had continued to keep inflation low, particularly for market services, which have a relatively high domestic labour cost component. ", " Private non-mining business investment had grown very strongly over 2017, driven by non-residential construction. Members noted that businesses had continued to report positive conditions, with above-average levels reported in all states. Survey measures of capacity utilisation had also continued to rise. An increasing proportion of businesses had been reporting that constraints on output were coming from premises and plant limitations and availability of materials. Consistent with this, the NAB survey measure of expected capital expenditure had risen to above-average levels over the preceding year. The pipeline of non-residential construction work yet to be done had also increased, particularly for office buildings in Sydney and Melbourne, where tenant demand had been strong. Public infrastructure spending had also continued to support growth in economic activity. ", " Export volumes looked to have recovered somewhat in early 2018, after declining in the December quarter. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports appeared to have increased strongly as production ramped up in Western Australia, and coal export volumes had partially recovered from the supply disruptions in late 2017. Members noted that further growth in resource exports was expected as the remaining LNG projects were completed and additional production capacity came on line. However, the completion of construction on these projects would largely offset the boost to economic growth from this source. ", " The prices of Australia's commodity exports, and thus the terms of trade, had been higher than expected a year earlier. However, prices were still expected to decline over the period ahead, as additional global supply of bulk commodities came on line. Members noted that the terms of trade were expected to remain high relative to the averages of prior decades, reflecting continued strong global demand for bulk commodities. ", " In the housing sector, dwelling investment was expected to remain at a high level over the period ahead, given the historically high pipeline of residential work yet to be done, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. In established housing markets, housing prices had eased a little further in Sydney and Melbourne over preceding months, but had been little changed elsewhere. ", "Members considered estimates of the median level of housing prices across the capital cities, observing that the relative ordering of price levels broadly corresponded to the sizes of the populations across the cities. Members noted that housing prices in Sydney had tended to have the most pronounced cycles over recent times and that median housing prices in Perth were at a similar level to those in Brisbane, following the unwinding of the mining investment boom. ", "Household consumption had grown solidly over 2017, and recent data on retail and motor vehicle sales, as well as information from the Bank's liaison, suggested that this momentum had continued in early 2018. Members noted that consumption had been relatively resilient to the slower growth in household income over recent years. ", " Turning to the labour market, members observed that employment growth had moderated in 2018 following very strong growth in 2017. The growth in employment in the first quarter of 2018 had been in part-time jobs, whereas increases in full-time jobs had driven overall employment growth over 2017. The unemployment rate had remained around 5½ per cent since mid 2017, as the growth in employment had been matched by a rise in the participation rate. Survey measures of job vacancies and hiring intentions, as well as information from the Bank's liaison, pointed to above-average employment growth in the near term. Consistent with this, an increasing number of firms responding to the NAB business survey had been reporting availability of suitable labour as a constraint on output. Members observed that growth in the wage price index had not picked up as much or as quickly as its past correlation with the NAB business survey measure of availability of suitable labour would have implied. A similar divergence had also occurred in the corresponding data for the United States. Members discussed possible reasons for this divergence, including competitive pressures from globalisation and technological change. ", "Members noted that the momentum in domestic demand over the second half of 2017 had been stronger than expected three months earlier, reflecting upward revisions to household consumption growth in previous quarters and stronger-than-expected growth in non-mining investment in the December quarter. Beyond that, the Bank's forecast for GDP growth was little changed. Growth was expected to increase to a little above 3 per cent from late 2018, supported by low interest rates and the upswing in the global economy. ", " The Bank continued to forecast a gradual pick-up in inflation over the following couple of years as spare capacity in the economy is absorbed and wages growth gradually picks up. Members noted, however, that spare capacity in the labour market would remain for some time. Headline CPI inflation was expected to be a little above 2 per cent in both 2018 and 2019. Underlying inflation was also expected to increase from close to 2 per cent currently to above 2 per cent by the end of the forecast period. ", "Members were briefed on developments in the South Australian economy. They noted that conditions in South Australia had improved over the preceding year, in line with the national trend. Growth had been broadly based across consumption, business investment and public demand. Employment growth over recent years had been concentrated in household services, as it had been in the rest of Australia. Wine and wheat exports are important contributors to the South Australian economy, with fruit, vegetables and meat also becoming increasingly important exports from the state. Members discussed the effect of the closure of the car-building industry in South Australia, noting that, in net terms, manufacturing employment had been relatively steady over recent years. Members recognised that the car plant closures had nevertheless been disruptive and difficult for many individuals and communities. "], "International Economic Conditions": ["Members commenced their discussion of international economic conditions by noting that conditions in the global economy overall had remained positive. Economic forecasters had gradually upgraded their outlook for the global economy over the preceding year. While global GDP growth was expected to ease a little over the following couple of years, growth was still expected to be at or above trend in most of Australia's trading partners. This should add to inflationary pressures over time, particularly in the major advanced economies. The outlook for the global economy was little changed from the Bank's previous forecast. ", " The global economic expansion of recent years had absorbed spare capacity, particularly in the major advanced economies, where unemployment rates had moved below estimates of full employment and wages growth had picked up modestly. Core inflation had been drifting up recently in some economies, but remained low. ", " Turning to the recent data, members noted that survey measures of global business conditions had remained at high levels despite easing a little recently, especially in the euro area, and global trade growth had been resilient. Members noted that GDP growth in east Asia (excluding China and Japan) looked to have picked up in early 2018. This was particularly the case in the high-income economies, where growth in consumption and investment had strengthened. Together with a range of other indicators, this suggested that the softer economic data for this region in late 2017 had been temporary. ", " In China, economic growth had eased a little around the turn of the year, but had been fairly steady in year-ended terms at around 7 per cent. Members noted that growth had been materially stronger in nominal terms, at 11 per cent over the year, which was helpful in the context of high levels of debt in the economy. ", " Members had a detailed discussion of the deepening economic linkages between the Chinese and Australian economies. They noted that bilateral trade had broadened in scope over the prior decade to encompass a wider range of goods and services. Although exports to China are still weighted towards bulk commodities, Australian exports of tourism and education services had increased notably in recent years. Members noted the strong global competition to supply the Chinese market and that Australia does not have the same natural comparative advantage in other exports as it has in some resources. Direct investment in Australia from China had also increased over the preceding 15 years, driven initially by investment in mining and energy, and more recently by a shift towards real estate, transport and infrastructure. Nevertheless, direct investment from China remains a small share of the total outstanding stock of foreign investment in Australia. ", "Members were also briefed on developments in the Chinese financial system. The evolution of the financial system since the late 1970s had played a key role in facilitating industrial and urban development in China. Members noted that, over the preceding decade, the role of credit in the Chinese economy had become more expansive, reflecting new forms of lending and borrowing activity and spurred on by regulatory arbitrage (particularly on the part of small banks). While credit growth had helped to sustain strong rates of economic growth, financial stability risks had also risen. In their discussion, members focused on the growing size, interconnectedness and opacity of the Chinese financial system. They noted that targeted policies recently implemented had been aimed at preventing a further rise in financial stability risks while minimising the impact on GDP growth. However, it was acknowledged that considerable uncertainty remains over the nature of the adjustment that could follow the decade-long credit boom in China. Members also discussed how the authorities might act to help reconfigure the financial system over the longer term to better support future drivers of growth in the Chinese economy. Key concerns of the Chinese authorities in this regard were levelling the playing field for small and medium corporate borrowers, expanding the provision of retirement services and continuing with a measured pace of capital account reform. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that global financial conditions had been little changed in April and, overall, remained accommodative for households and businesses. This followed a modest tightening in financial conditions in recent months, including an increase in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve at its March meeting. In addition to this, the cost to banks and corporations of borrowing US dollars over short terms had risen and credit spreads on corporate bonds were a little wider than the narrow levels reached earlier in 2018. Members noted that market participants had suggested the tightness in short-term funding markets reflected increased US Treasury bill issuance in the context of a higher US budget deficit as well as the effect of recent US tax measures. There was uncertainty about how long and to what extent these pressures in money markets would persist; some aspects were likely to be temporary, while others reflected structural changes in these markets. ", "Members noted that long-term government bond yields in the advanced economies, including Australia, had increased somewhat in April. The rise was particularly pronounced in 10-year bond yields in the United States, which had moved above 3 per cent for the first time in over four years. This reflected greater compensation for inflation risk amid recent increases in oil and some other commodity prices, as well as a rise in real yields. Government bond yields in the euro area had increased to a lesser extent than in other markets, consistent with generally weaker-than-expected economic outcomes in the region, following stronger economic outcomes in 2017. ", "Central bank policy settings in the major advanced economies were unchanged since the previous meeting. In China, the People's Bank of China had lowered the reserve requirement ratio. Members noted that this would tend to increase liquidity and had been associated with a general decline in interest rates, which would help to offset the increased cost of finance associated with measures aimed at restricting the availability of credit provided by non-bank entities. ", "Global equity markets had been mixed over the preceding month, with changing sentiment around international trade policy developments contributing to higher volatility in share prices in the United States and China. Australian equity prices had increased slightly, underpinned by rises in resources and energy stocks following higher commodity prices; share prices of Australian financial institutions had fallen by around 7 per cent since the end of 2017. ", " Volatility in foreign exchange markets remained at low levels. The Australian dollar had been little changed on a trade-weighted basis over the preceding month, but had depreciated by around 5 per cent since the end of 2017 in an environment of lower bulk commodity prices and a declining yield differential between Australia and the United States. The Australian dollar exchange rate had remained in a narrow range over the preceding two years or so relative to the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms. ", " Members discussed developments in money markets in some detail, noting that increases in US dollar borrowing rates (above changes arising from US monetary policy) had influenced money market rates for a number of other currencies, with Australian markets particularly affected. This link reflects the fact that Australian banks raise funds in US dollar markets to help fund their Australian dollar assets. Members noted that persistently higher borrowing costs in short-term money markets would increase the overall cost of funds for a range of financial institutions and some corporate borrowers. Rates on wholesale deposits offered by banks had also increased accordingly. Members noted that, more recently, money market spreads had declined a little from the levels reached around the end of the March quarter. ", " In Australia, corporate bond spreads, including for financial institutions, had risen slightly over the preceding month, closely in line with developments in international markets, but remained at relatively low levels. The overall funding composition of banks had been quite stable for a number of years. Members noted the staff assessment that the aggregate cost of both short- and long-term debt funding had risen since February. The overall effect on bank funding costs had been less than the rise in the cost of wholesale debt funding since February, in part because there had been little change in interest rates for retail deposits, which account for around one-third of total bank funding. ", " The rise in funding costs was expected to flow through to a slight increase in lending rates for larger businesses. However, to date, the average variable housing lending rate on the outstanding stock of loans had declined since late 2017. Growth in housing credit had stabilised in 2018 following declines in the growth rates of lending to both owner-occupiers and investors in 2017. Members noted that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) had been conducting a targeted review of lenders’ assessments of reasonable household expenditures in loan applications as part of efforts to improve lending standards, and that lending standards might be tightened further in the context of the current high level of public scrutiny of banks. ", " Pricing in money markets implied that the cash rate is expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period, with a 25 basis point increase expected in mid 2019. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the flow of economic data over the preceding month, for both the global economy and Australia, had pointed to a continuation of the broad trends over the preceding year or so. Conditions in the global economy had remained positive and there had been further signs of a gradual strengthening in the Australian economy. ", " The global economic environment was expected to remain favourable over the next couple of years, with most of Australia's major trading partners generally expected to grow at or above their trend growth rates. Inflation had remained low but had increased a little in some economies and further increases were expected, given the already tight labour markets, particularly in the major advanced economies. Against this backdrop, a number of central banks had withdrawn some monetary stimulus and further moves in this direction were expected. The Chinese economy had continued to grow solidly, with the authorities paying increased attention to the risks in the financial sector and the sustainability of growth. How the Chinese authorities navigate these various challenges would be important for growth in Australia and the rest of the world. Developments in US–China trade relations would also be important for the outlook for the global economy. ", " Long-term bond yields in the advanced economies and, more recently, credit spreads had risen, but remained low and financial conditions generally remained accommodative. Higher costs of borrowing in US dollar short-term money markets had flowed through to higher short-term interest rates in some other countries, including Australia. Equity market volatility had increased from the very low levels of 2017, in part reflecting concerns over the direction of international trade policy in the United States. The Australian dollar had remained in its narrow range of the preceding couple of years. ", " Domestically, inflation had remained low. The recent inflation data were in line with the Bank's expectations, with both CPI and underlying inflation running marginally below 2 per cent. Business conditions had remained positive and non-mining business investment had been growing strongly. There had been increasing indications of emerging capacity constraints, although this had not yet translated into a material pick-up in wages growth. The strength in employment had supported solid growth in consumption and this momentum looked to have continued into 2018. ", " Housing market conditions had eased a little further in Sydney and Melbourne, and had been little changed elsewhere. Tighter credit standards and APRA's supervisory measures had been helpful in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets. However, household debt levels remained high, which members noted continued to pose an element of uncertainty for the outlook for consumption growth. ", " The low level of interest rates, along with the global economic upswing, had continued to underpin growth in the Australian economy, with progress having been made over the preceding year in reducing unemployment and having inflation return towards the target range. Further progress on these goals was expected over coming years. However, this progress was expected to be gradual. The Bank's central forecast for the economy to grow by a little above 3 per cent from late 2018 was expected to be enough to bring about a modest decline in the unemployment rate over that period. As demand strengthens, so too should wages growth and inflation, with underlying inflation expected to move higher later in the forecast period. The increase in wages growth and inflation was expected to be gradual because spare capacity in the economy was expected to be reduced only slowly. ", " Members noted that there were risks to the forecasts in both directions. Among these, an appreciation of the Australian dollar would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than otherwise. Members also noted that a further tightening in lending standards in Australia, particularly in the context of the current high level of public scrutiny of banks, was possible, which would affect household borrowing and spending. In the other direction, it was possible that global inflation could turn out to be higher than expected. Domestically, there were uncertainties around the extent and speed of the pick-up in wages growth and inflation that might occur as the unemployment rate declined. ", " In the current circumstances, members agreed that it was more likely that the next move in the cash rate would be up, rather than down. As progress in lowering unemployment and having inflation return to the midpoint of the target range was expected to be gradual, members also agreed that there was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed that while this progress was unfolding, it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Reserve Bank to be a source of stability and confidence. ", " Taking into account the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},

GDP outcomes in major economies in the September quarter had generally been somewhat betterthan expected after very large declines in activity in the first half of the year. In China, where therecovery was most advanced, and in some other Asian economies where health outcomes had been relativelyfavourable, the contraction in GDP earlier in the year had been largely or fully reversed. However, GDPin the September quarter in Europe and the United States remained well below pre-pandemic levels, evenafter the rebound in the quarter, and this was expected to be the case for some time.", "Members emphasised that the global outlook continued to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty.The main source of uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic, and the policy and behaviouralresponses to it. Indicators suggested that the pace of the global recovery had faltered and was quiteuneven. The resurgence in new cases of the virus in recent weeks threatened the recovery in someeconomies, notably in Europe.", "In their discussion of global labour markets, members noted that while recent trends in unemploymentrates had varied across economies, significant spare capacity was evident. To date, fiscal and monetarypolicy support had been effective in limiting the rise in recorded unemployment in some countries.However, underemployment was still high and the recent upswing in new cases of the virus in thenorthern hemisphere could damage these economies' labour markets in the period ahead. Membersnoted that, in these circumstances, substantial ongoing policy support would be needed.", "Trends in global commodity markets had been mixed and reflected a range of developments. Over theprior 6 months, the recovery in industrial production and fixed asset investment, particularly inChina, had supported the prices of base metals and iron ore. Supply disruptions in Brazil had alsosupported higher iron ore prices through the year, although in recent months prices had retraced alittle to be around 25 per cent higher since January. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot priceshad fallen significantly in the first half of the year alongside a very sharp decline in oil prices,before rebounding strongly in recent months. A pick-up in demand, extended maintenance at someAustralian LNG facilities and disruptions to US supply had all contributed to this rebound. Meanwhile,global demand for thermal and coking coal had generally been subdued and prices were still around20 per cent below levels at the start of the year, following large declines in April."], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["In reviewing the updated set of forecasts for the domestic economy, members noted that the outlookfor GDP in the near term had been revised up a little. They noted that, since the onset of thepandemic, consumption, business investment and labour market outcomes had generally been better thaninitially feared, with significant policy support a key factor during and after the intensive period oflockdowns. However, the recovery in activity was expected to be modest in the context of the largestpeacetime contraction in GDP since the Great Depression, and members acknowledged that GDP was notexpected to return to its pre-pandemic level until the end of 2021.", "A feature of the forecast profile was a significant further downward revision to expected populationgrowth, in line with the updated projections in the Australian Government Budget, which had beenannounced in October. These projections for population growth, of around 0.2 per cent in<span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> and 0.4 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2021/22</span>, represented the lowest rates of growth since the First World War.", "Members considered 3 scenarios in their discussion of the outlook. In the baseline scenario, GDPgrowth was expected to contract by around 4 per cent over 2020, before growing by5 per cent over 2021 and by 4 per cent over 2022. This assumed no additionalsignificant <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> outbreaks and that domestic activity restrictionswould continue to be lifted, although restrictions on international travel would remain in place untilthe end of 2021.", "Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, 2 alternative scenarios were considered,based largely on different assumptions about health outcomes and restrictions on activity. A plausibledownside scenario involved further significant outbreaks of the virus in Australia and abroad. Thiswould result in renewed lockdowns, further delays in the opening of international borders and amaterial deterioration in household and business confidence. The recovery would be substantiallydelayed in this scenario, with the level of GDP still falling a little short of pre-pandemic levels bythe end of the forecast period in 2022. A stronger economic recovery than envisaged in the baselinescenario was also considered, where additional progress in the control of the virus is achieved,leading to a more rapid easing of restrictions and a faster rebound in confidence, private demand andservices exports. In this scenario, the level of GDP would exceed pre-pandemic levels in mid 2021and would be a couple of per cent higher than in the baseline scenario by the end of 2022.", "The starting point for these economic projections was a little higher than expected 3 monthsearlier, despite the expected effects of the restrictions in Victoria in the September and Decemberquarters. Household cash flow and the rebound in consumption were seen as driving the recovery. Reducedconsumption possibilities as a result of restrictions on activity were important in driving the12 per cent decline in consumption in the June quarter. The subsequent easing in theserestrictions was expected to underpin the recovery through to the end of the year and into 2021. Evenso, consumption in the December quarter 2020 was expected to be around 5 per cent below thelevel of a year earlier.", "Members discussed the causes and implications of the unusually high rate of household saving in theJune quarter. The increase in savings had been due to limits on spending opportunities and stronggrowth in household disposable income, despite a sharp fall in employment and hours worked. Theincrease in social assistance payments had been particularly important in supporting the growth inincomes during the pandemic. Households were expected to consume a larger share of their income in theperiod ahead as more opportunities for consumption became possible, and as some households felt areduced need to accumulate or maintain high levels of savings for precautionary reasons. This wasexpected to support overall economic activity through the period where household disposable incomedeclined as a result of reduced social assistance payments and the expiry of other temporary supportmeasures.", "Members discussed the substantial support for the economy announced in the Australian GovernmentBudget. The positive net fiscal impact on the economy was projected to be the largest in many decades.Forecasts for public consumption and investment, including infrastructure spending, had been upgraded.Tax incentives for firms, such as accelerated depreciation allowances, had prompted an upward revisionto the forecasts for business investment. Even so, high uncertainty and expectations of subdued demandwere likely to restrain business spending over the forecast period.", "Turning to the housing market, members noted that prices had declined over recent months in Melbourneand, to a lesser extent, in Sydney. These declines had been smaller than those recorded in 2018.Elsewhere, housing prices had generally increased in recent months. Housing loan commitments and pricetrends across the country suggested that conditions in the detached housing market remained strongerthan in the apartment market; growth in rents for apartments remained weak in most cities.", "Members discussed recent developments in Australian trade volumes, noting that while servicesaccounted for a smaller share of overall trade than goods, services trade had been particularlyaffected during the pandemic. The closure of international borders had led to sharp falls in tourismimports and exports, and education exports had also been much lower. In cases where foreign studentswere studying online at Australian educational institutions but not physically in the country, thiswould generate fee income. However, these students would not be consuming other goods and services inAustralia; typically, this contributes a little more to education exports than fees.", "In their discussion of the labour market, members noted that conditions in the September quarter hadimproved and outcomes had been better than expected. But labour market conditions remained softoverall. In the month of September, outcomes had been mixed: employment had declined, led bydevelopments in Victoria, while total hours worked had recovered a little further as the increase inaverage hours worked had more than offset the decline in employment. Members observed that hours forpart-time workers had recovered to pre-pandemic levels, while many full-time workers were still onreduced hours.", "Under the baseline scenario, the unemployment rate was forecast to increase to a little below8 per cent by the end of the year. This was higher than the 6.9 per cent rate ofunemployment in September, but below the 10 per cent peak forecast 3 months earlier.With employment expected to grow steadily and more people drawn back into the labour market over theforecast period, the unemployment rate was expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels through to theend of 2022. However, in the downside and upside scenarios, the unemployment rate could besignificantly higher or lower than projected in the baseline forecast, depending largely on theevolution of the pandemic. Members noted a high degree of uncertainty is likely around unemploymentrate outcomes in the coming months as restrictions are eased in Victoria and temporary support policiesfor the labour market are adjusted or expire. Members also discussed the high level of underemployment,which highlighted that significant spare capacity remained in the labour market and that this waslikely to be the case for a considerable period.", "Members noted that spare capacity in the labour market had been weighing on wages and underlyinginflation, and would continue to do so for some time. Headline inflation outcomes in the June andSeptember quarters had been volatile because of the introduction and subsequent removal of policymeasures, especially the subsidy for child care and preschool, as well as large changes in fuel prices.The effect of temporary policy changes was expected to persist into 2021, but to a lesser extent.Behavioural changes during the pandemic had also had a large effect on some prices; for instance,prices of consumer durables had been supported by unusually strong demand. But, overall, membersconcurred that the outlook for inflation was very subdued. Both headline and trimmed mean inflationwere forecast to bottom out below 1 per cent in 2021 before reaching1½ per cent by the end of 2022.", "Members briefly reviewed how the domestic economy had evolved over the preceding year relative to theBank's forecasts for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation, as had become the Board'spractice in preceding years. On this occasion, members acknowledged that economic growth had been wellbelow what had been expected in the November 2019 forecasts, owing to the extraordinary economiccontraction following the onset of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> pandemic. While a globalpandemic was a known risk, its timing could not be predicted. Members noted that new data sources andmethods, and extensive outreach with other agencies and liaison contacts, had played a valuable role ininforming the Bank's forecasts during the period of heightened uncertainty over preceding months.These enhancements would assist the forecasting process in the future."], "International Financial Markets": ["Members noted that global financial market conditions had remained very accommodative. Central bankswere expected to maintain their highly accommodative policy settings for an extended period. Marketpricing implied that some central banks, including the Bank of England, European Central Bank andReserve Bank of New Zealand, were expected to lower policy rates further in coming months.", "Central banks in most advanced economies had continued to purchase significant amounts of governmentdebt in secondary markets. Government bond yields had remained very low across advanced economies partlyas a result of these purchases and despite strong issuance by governments. This issuance had also beenmet by strong demand from private sector investors.", "Corporate funding conditions had remained favourable in advanced economies, including Australia. Debtissuance had eased – after firms had raised large amounts of funding earlier in the year –and spreads on corporate debt had remained low. The number of corporate defaults had subsided overrecent months. Equity prices had declined from recent highs, following rising <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases in Europe and the United States. Nonetheless, the overall cost ofequity had been low, which had supported high levels of equity issuance and corporate takeoveractivity.", "In China, monetary policy had been less stimulatory than elsewhere because economic conditions had beenmore favourable and policymakers had been seeking to balance risks to the economy against risks tofinancial stability. Aided by higher interest rates and portfolio inflows, the renminbi had appreciatednoticeably over the preceding few months."], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["Domestically, in preceding weeks financial market participants had more strongly anticipated that theBank would announce further monetary policy measures. Specifically, the Bank was expected to: reducethe cash rate target, the 3-year Australian Government bond yield target and the interest rate ondrawings under the Term Funding Facility; reduce the interest rate paid on Exchange Settlement balancesat the Bank; and implement a program of government bond purchases for the longer-maturity part of theyield curve (beyond the 3-year tenor).", "Members noted that, in response, yields on Australian Government Securities (AGS) had declined acrossthe curve. Yields on 10-year AGS had been high relative to the 10-year government bond yields of otheradvanced countries. They also observed that this was partly because the holdings of government debt bythe Bank were relatively low as a share of GDP. The 10-year AGS yield had declined relative to USTreasury yields as market expectations for a government bond purchase program in Australia had firmed.The decline in Australian yields relative to those for other countries, along with lower commodityprices, had contributed to a depreciation of the Australian dollar of around 5 per cent sinceearly September. Meanwhile, Australian equity prices had outperformed major overseas equity indicesover the preceding month.", "The Bank's policy actions to date had kept Australian banks' funding costs at historicallylow levels and had supported the availability of credit to households and businesses. Deposit rates haddeclined noticeably in March and April, and had continued to decline since then. The share of depositspaying interest rates close to zero had increased to be a little over one-quarter of the majorbanks' (non-equity) funding, but a sizeable share of deposits was still paying rates of1 per cent or higher. Lending rates for both housing and business loans had also declinednoticeably following the Bank's package of measures in March and had gradually moved lower sincethen.", "Demand for housing finance had increased a little further in September (outside Victoria) in linewith the pick-up in some indicators of housing market activity. Growth in housing credit toowner-occupiers had risen a little, while credit to investors in housing had expanded only modestlyafter having declined for much of the year. Some lenders had reversed some of the tightening in theavailability of housing finance that had occurred earlier in the pandemic, which had mostly reflectedthe application of existing credit standards in the context of weaker economic conditions. By contrast,demand for business credit had remained weak and credit supply had tightened since March. Lending tosmall and medium-sized businesses had been little changed, while lending to large businesses hadretraced most of the sharp increase earlier in the year, as precautionary lines of credit had beenrepaid.", "Households had continued to pay off housing loans and increase balances in offset and redraw accountsat a faster rate than in early 2020, at the same time as lower interest rates had reduced theirinterest payments. Personal credit had also continued to decline as households paid off their creditcard debts. Members noted that this behaviour was consistent with weak consumption growth and waslikely to have been facilitated by the government's income support programs as well as withdrawalsfrom superannuation."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global economy had been recovering fromthe initial virus outbreaks, with the recovery most advanced in China. Nevertheless, most economies werestill well short of the output levels that prevailed prior to the pandemic and the recent virusoutbreaks posed a downside risk to the outlook, particularly in Europe. Globally, inflation remainedvery low and below central bank targets.", "In Australia, economic activity had contracted substantially in the early months of the pandemic andhad since recovered some of that decline. With the restrictions on activity in Victoria having beenlifted, the near-term outlook had improved a little. Fiscal and monetary policy support had beeneffective in preserving many jobs and firms through the period of restrictions and the AustralianGovernment Budget had provided further stimulus. Nevertheless, the recovery was still expected to beprotracted and the outlook remained dependent on successful containment of the virus. It would take sometime for output to reach its pre-pandemic level, and it had become increasingly clear that an extendedperiod of high unemployment was in prospect. The high unemployment rate and excess capacity across theeconomy more broadly were expected to result in subdued wages growth and inflation over comingyears.", "Members agreed that the Board's policy measures were continuing to support the Australian economyby underpinning very low borrowing costs and the supply of credit to households and businesses. Therewas a very high level of liquidity in the Australian financial system and the mid-March policy packagehad helped to lower funding costs. Authorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down$83 billion of low-cost funding through the Term Funding Facility and had access to a further$104 billion under the facility. Members noted that the Australian banking system, with its strongcapital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping the economy traverse the currentdifficult period.", "The Board discussed the outlook for the economy and concluded that, despite somewhat better recentoutcomes in Australia, the recovery was expected to be protracted and uneven. The outlook implied alarge shortfall in activity and employment from levels that would be consistent with full employment. Toprovide additional support for the recovery and complement the significant support from fiscal policy,the Board resolved to introduce a further package of monetary measures, namely:", "Under the program to purchase longer-dated bonds, members agreed the Bank would purchase nominalbonds issued by the Australian Government and by the states and territories, with an expected <span class=\"no-wrap\">80/20</span> split. These bonds would be purchased in the secondary market throughregular auctions conducted by the Bank, with the first auction to be conducted on 5 November. TheBank would not purchase bonds directly from the government, and so the purchase of bonds by the Bankwould not constitute government financing. The longstanding separation of monetary policy and fiscalfinancing in Australia would therefore remain in place. The Australian Government and the states andterritories fund themselves in the market and their bond auctions had been heavily oversubscribed overrecent months, notwithstanding the significant increase in the size of these auctions.", "The Bank remained prepared to purchase bonds in whatever quantity is required to achieve the 3-yearyield target. Any bonds the Bank needs to purchase to support the 3-year yield target would be inaddition to the $100 billion program.", "In considering the case for the further monetary measures, the Board recognised that the complementarynature of the measures meant that it would be desirable for them to be implemented as a package. Inparticular, interest rates further along the yield curve capture expectations about the path ofshort-term rates, so lowering short-term rates would also lower rates at the long end of the yieldcurve. The Board concluded that the combination of government bond purchases and lower interest ratesacross the yield curve would assist the recovery by lowering financing costs for borrowers; contributingto a lower exchange rate than otherwise; and supporting asset prices, which would help to strengthenbalance sheets.", "Members discussed the merits of targeting a bond yield around 5 years but decided against this andto continue with the 3-year yield target. Members judged that a yield target is most effective when itsmaturity is consistent with the Board's forward guidance on the cash rate. The Board expects thecash rate to remain at its current level for at least 3 years, but beyond that members have lessconfidence about the path of interest rates. Moreover, members acknowledged that other factors can havea greater influence on yields at longer horizons.", "Members considered whether to implement the package at this time or to wait for further information.The Board concluded that it was the appropriate time to implement the package, as it had become clearerthat unemployment would remain high and inflation subdued for an extended period, and that furtherinformation in coming months was unlikely to change that assessment. The Board viewed addressing thehigh rate of unemployment as an important national priority. The package would add to the substantialmonetary stimulus already provided earlier in the year and would complement the significant steps takenby the Australian Government, including in the recent Budget, to support jobs and growth. It was alsolikely that having the various arms of policy all taking steps in the same direction would deliver agreater impact than the sum of the individual parts. This would be especially so during a period inwhich the economy is opening up and people are more willing and able to spend.", "Members also discussed the effect of lower interest rates on those who rely on interest income andacknowledged the difficulties that low interest rates generate for these households. While the effect ofmonetary easing falls unevenly across the community, in aggregate lower interest rates boost disposableincomes for the household sector, which stimulates spending and supports employment. Lower interestrates also have broader stimulatory effects on the economy through other channels, including theexchange rate and asset prices. Members noted that very low interest rates were a global phenomenon,reflecting the high level of the supply of savings relative to the demand to use those savings to investin productive capital. This had reduced returns for savers, particularly in low-risk assets.", "Members discussed the effect that the further monetary measures would have on financial andmacroeconomic stability. The further easing was expected to reduce financial stability risks bysupporting employment, private sector balance sheets and the broader economy. The Board weighed thisbenefit against the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate environment,including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing market. Onbalance, the Board concluded that there were greater financial stability benefits from a strongereconomy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.", "Members agreed that, with the cash rate target at 10 basis points and the interest rate onExchange Settlement balances at zero, interest rates would have been lowered as far as it made sense todo so in the current environment. They considered that there was little to be gained from short-terminterest rates moving into negative territory and continued to view a negative policy rate asextraordinarily unlikely.", "Given the outlook for both employment and inflation, the Board considered that monetary and fiscalsupport will be required for some time. The Board remains committed to not increasing the cash rateuntil actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For thisto occur, wages growth would have to be materially higher than recent levels. This would requiresignificant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. Given the outlook, the Board doesnot expect to increase the cash rate for at least 3 years. The Board remains of the view that itwould be appropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself were increased.", "Members agreed that the focus over the period ahead will be the government bond purchase program. Atits future meetings, the Board will closely monitor the effects of the bond purchases on the economy andon market functioning, as well as the evolving outlook for jobs and inflation. The Board is prepared todo more if necessary."], "The Decision": ["The Board agreed on the following policy settings:"]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 6 February 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Tony Richards (Head, Payments Policy Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by observing that global GDP growth in 2017 had exceeded the expectations of most forecasters. The pick-up in growth had been synchronised across economies and was likely to be sustained in 2018, supported by accommodative monetary policy across the globe and an upturn in international trade. The increase in demand for traded goods had been broadly based across regions and especially pronounced for commodity exporters. Stronger economic growth had been accompanied by a further tightening of labour market conditions in many economies, and unemployment rates were low in a number of advanced economies. Core inflation had remained subdued in most regions, despite some increase in upstream price pressures. ", " Growth in many of Australia's major trading partners was expected to remain above potential and inflationary pressures were expected to build as spare capacity continued to be absorbed. The near-term outlook for growth in Australia's major trading partners had been revised up slightly since the November <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, reflecting the generally positive run of data, particularly in the euro area, and passage of the tax package in the United States. Members noted that global growth could continue to surprise on the upside, given the synchronised nature of the current upturn. Stronger demand could induce higher global inflation than expected, which would have implications both for financial asset prices and exchange rates. Stronger global growth would boost growth and inflation in Australia, particularly if the exchange rate were to depreciate. ", " Growth in business investment had been an increasingly important driver of growth in the major advanced economies and high-income economies in Asia. This provided more confidence that growth would be maintained at above-potential rates for a while, consistent with the support provided by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies in many economies. Growth in consumption had been above average for a number of years in the major advanced economies, supported by strong growth in employment. Despite this, wage growth had remained muted, although some pick-up was expected given the tightness of labour markets. Members noted that low growth in labour productivity was likely to have contributed to the low growth in wages, but that it was also possible there was more spare capacity in labour markets in these economies than implied by conventional estimates. ", " Members observed that growth in China had been stronger than expected over 2017, but that investment growth had slowed and conditions in the industrial sector had softened over recent months, partly because of government policies to reduce pollution. Housing price inflation and activity in the residential property market had also eased over the preceding year, particularly in the larger cities, consistent with policies to address buoyant housing market conditions and dampen speculation. While China's GDP growth was expected to moderate over the following few years, it was still forecast to remain strong, supported by accommodative fiscal policy and financial conditions. However, there continued to be uncertainties around the outlook for the Chinese economy. Leverage remained high and members noted that policies designed to reduce financial risks could lower growth in the short term, although the downside risks to medium-term economic growth were also likely to be lower if these policies were successful. Members observed that the risks associated with high leverage would also be mitigated by higher inflation, to the extent that this reduced the burden of debt in real terms over time. ", " Stronger growth in the world economy had contributed to higher commodity prices over 2017, although supply factors and policy measures in China had also been important. Members noted that higher-than-expected commodity prices had supported Australia's terms of trade over 2017 and that the forecast of the terms of trade had consequently been revised a little higher for the near term. Nonetheless, the terms of trade were still expected to decline over the following two years, partly reflecting prospective increases in low-cost supplies of bulk commodities. Oil and base metals prices had risen since the previous meeting. Members recognised that movements in oil prices had already had direct effects on headline inflation, both domestically and abroad, and that increases in oil prices could have further indirect effects on inflation if higher business input costs were passed on. Prices for Australian iron ore and coal had also increased significantly in recent months, partly reflecting strong demand in China for high-quality inputs for steel production following the introduction of anti-pollution measures by the Chinese authorities. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Domestic economic data released since the previous meeting had generally been in line with, or a little stronger than, expectations at the time of the November <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. GDP had increased by 0.6 per cent in the September quarter and by 2.8 per cent in year-ended terms, which was broadly consistent with estimates of the potential growth rate for the economy. In general, business conditions in the September quarter had been stronger than expected, while conditions in the household sector had been a little weaker. GDP growth was expected to be a little above 3 per cent over both 2018 and 2019. ", " Household consumption had been little changed in the September quarter, which was notably weaker than had been expected. More recent data suggested that the weakness had not continued into the December quarter; growth in retail sales volumes had rebounded in the quarter, which pointed to a pick-up in goods consumption. Information from the Bank's liaison program had pointed to moderate growth in retail sales since then and confirmed that competition in the retail sector remained strong. In year-ended terms, growth in consumption had been steady at a modest pace despite relatively weak growth in household disposable income. Members noted that the Bank's forecast for a modest rise in growth in consumption was predicated on a pick-up in household income growth. There was still a risk that growth in consumption might turn out to be weaker than forecast if household income growth were to increase by less than expected. In an environment of high household indebtedness, consumption might be particularly sensitive to adverse developments in household income or wealth. ", " Activity in the residential construction sector had declined in the September quarter but residential building approvals had increased in the second half of 2017. The pipeline of work to be done had remained particularly strong in New South Wales and Victoria. In contrast, the pipeline of work to be done had continued to decline in Western Australia and Queensland; members noted that this reflected a healthy rebalancing of demand and supply given that there had been a significant decline in population growth, and therefore demand for housing, in these states. More broadly, information from the Bank's liaison with developers had suggested that demand from domestic investors and foreign buyers had declined somewhat. ", " Conditions in established housing markets had generally eased. Prices for detached houses had fallen in Sydney, especially for more expensive properties, and growth in housing prices had slowed considerably in Melbourne. In Perth and Brisbane, housing price growth had been little changed over prior months. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments was scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Members noted that nationwide measures of growth in advertised rents had risen, with rents no longer falling as quickly in Perth. This suggested that rent inflation in the CPI could also be expected to rise gradually over the forecast period. ", " Business conditions had remained at a relatively high level in recent quarters. Private non-mining business investment had increased by more than expected in the September quarter, to be nearly 10 per cent higher over the preceding year. Members noted that the prospects for private non-mining investment were more positive than they had been for some time. Private non-residential building approvals had been at a high level since mid 2017, the pipeline of work to be done had increased and investment intentions pointed to moderate growth over the coming year. Members noted that there had continued to be positive spillovers from the pick-up in public infrastructure investment, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. Work done on public infrastructure had increased significantly over the year to September, a large component of which had been transport projects, and the pipeline of public infrastructure work was around its highest level as a share of GDP in several decades. ", " Although mining investment overall had been unchanged in the September quarter and was expected to decline over the following few quarters, there had been investment in the resources sector to offset depreciation of the capital stock, in Western Australia in particular. This was expected to support activity in the Western Australian economy more broadly, where there were signs that business conditions had begun to improve. ", " Export and import volumes had both increased in the September quarter, such that net exports had not contributed to growth. More recent data suggested that export volumes had declined in the December quarter. Coal exports had been affected by maintenance and congestion at ports, as well as industrial action. These issues had since mostly been resolved, so coal exports were expected to have recovered in early 2018. Rural exports had been affected by poor weather towards the end of 2017. ", " In the labour market, outcomes across a range of indicators had been significantly stronger than expected over 2017. Employment had increased by around 3¼ per cent over 2017 and much of this growth had been in full-time jobs. The participation rate had also risen sharply over the year, to be close to the historical peak recorded in 2010. The unemployment rate had increased slightly in the month of December to 5.5 per cent, but was ¼ percentage point lower than a year earlier. ", " Members noted that the staff had forecast growth in employment to ease over the subsequent couple of years, compared with the relatively high rates of growth in preceding quarters, to be closer to growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate was expected to decline a little further over this period to 5¼ per cent, consistent with GDP growth rising to be above potential. This implied that some spare capacity in the labour market would remain over the forecast period, but members noted that it was uncertain how much spare capacity existed and how quickly it might be eroded. Members also noted that there was uncertainty about the future path of the participation rate, partly because it was difficult to determine whether recent increases had been a response to the strength of employment growth or the result of structural changes in the labour market, including the wider availability of flexible working arrangements. ", " Even though labour market conditions had improved noticeably over 2017, wage growth had remained subdued. Growth in the wage price index in the September quarter had been weaker than expected and wage growth outcomes associated with new enterprise agreements had been lower than the percentage increases incorporated in agreements they were replacing. This would affect aggregate wage growth over the forecast period, given that new enterprise agreements had an average term of around three years. Members noted that uncertainty remained about how employers would respond as spare capacity in the labour market diminished. Indeed, it was possible that ongoing strength in the demand for labour might result in wage growth picking up by more than anticipated, both in Australia and abroad. ", " The inflation data for the December quarter had been in line with the forecasts presented in the November <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. Trimmed mean inflation had been 0.4 per cent in the quarter and 1.8 per cent in year-ended terms. Headline inflation had picked up a little in the quarter to 0.6 per cent and 1.9 per cent in year-ended terms. The prices of fuel and fruit, which tend to be volatile, had risen strongly in the quarter, as had tobacco prices following another scheduled increase in the tobacco excise. Working in the other direction, prices of consumer durables had declined further, indicating the ongoing influence of strong competition in the retail sector. Members noted that food prices, excluding fruit and vegetables, had been little changed for nearly a decade, which also pointed to pervasive price competition in the retail sector. Prices of market services, which have a relatively high domestic labour cost component, had changed little in the December quarter. ", " The recent data had not materially changed the outlook for inflation. The forecast was for underlying inflation to increase gradually to around 2¼ per cent by mid 2020, partly in response to expected faster growth in labour costs as spare capacity in the labour market is absorbed. Headline inflation was expected to be higher than underlying inflation, partly because of scheduled increases in the tobacco excise. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by observing that the declines in global equity prices over preceding days had unwound the increase in equity prices since the beginning of 2018, but that this had followed a period of sustained strength. The declines in equity prices had followed a reassessment of the outlook for inflation in the United States, following stronger-than-expected wage data. Meanwhile, credit spreads had remained low and overall financing conditions had remained accommodative. ", " As expected, the US Federal Reserve had increased the federal funds rate again in December and market pricing indicated that market participants' expectations for the path of the federal funds rate over 2018 had risen to be close to the median of the Federal Open Market Committee's projections. The European Central Bank had reduced its rate of asset purchases in January, consistent with its announced plan. The Bank of Canada had increased its policy rate in January, as economic conditions strengthened, and market pricing suggested further gradual tightening in monetary policy was expected over 2018. ", " Members noted that long-term government bond yields had risen across the major markets over recent months. This had occurred against the backdrop of strong economic conditions globally, an increase in market expectations for the withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus and following passage of the tax package in the United States. Yields on Australian 10-year government bonds had increased by less than yields in the United States, resulting in their spread to US Treasury bond yields declining to low levels. In Japan, long-term government bond yields had been little changed as the Bank of Japan had reiterated its commitment to keeping 10-year yields around 0 per cent. ", " Despite the recent falls, global equity prices remained higher compared with a year earlier, particularly in the United States, where they had been supported by strength in technology stocks and the expected positive effects of tax cuts on economic growth and corporate earnings. Members discussed the recent increase in volatility in the equity market following a period of unusually low volatility. In other financial markets, volatility had remained below average. Conditions in the major corporate bond markets had remained strong; credit spreads had declined to around their lowest levels since the global financial crisis, supported by a pick-up in corporate earnings and accommodative monetary policies. Financial conditions had remained accommodative in emerging markets, and foreign capital had continued to flow into these markets as investors sought higher returns in the global environment of low yields. ", " Members discussed the structural changes in financial market trading that had occurred over time, including the increased prevalence of exchange-traded products, and the effects of this on market dynamics. ", " Members noted that there had been a broad-based depreciation of the US dollar over preceding months, notwithstanding increased expectations of further rises in the Federal Reserve's policy rate over the following couple of years and the fiscal stimulus embodied in the recently passed US tax package. The US dollar had been notably lower since the start of 2017 in nominal trade-weighted terms, while the euro had appreciated in trade-weighted terms over the same period. The Australian dollar had appreciated a little on a trade-weighted basis over prior months, but had remained within the relatively narrow range in which it had been over the preceding couple of years. ", " In China, financial market conditions had tightened over the preceding year as the authorities had continued to address risks in the financial system. Recently, the authorities had taken further steps to constrain growth in lending by non-bank entities. However, growth in bank credit had been little changed over the course of the prior year. ", " Australian equity prices had risen over the previous six months, driven by strength in the resources sector, while the prices of financial sector stocks had been broadly unchanged. Unlike other markets, Australian equity prices had not risen since the start of the year, but had declined on the day preceding the Board meeting following movements in global equity markets. ", " Members noted that the implied spread between the average outstanding lending and funding rates for Australian banks was estimated to have been stable since mid 2017. Deposit rates had declined somewhat over the course of 2017, as banks' demand for deposit funding had eased once they had adjusted their balance sheets to comply with the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which had come into effect at the start of 2018. Banks had also previously increased their long-term debt funding in readiness for the introduction of the NSFR. Bond issuance by Australian banks had remained strong in 2017, with bond tenors increasing further and spreads having continued to decline to the lowest level in 10 years. Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities had also been strong in 2017 and pricing of these securities had become more favourable to issuers, although the spreads relative to benchmark yields were still above levels seen a few years earlier. ", " Members observed that, while standard variable interest rates for housing loans had been little changed since mid 2017, the average outstanding variable rate had declined slightly as new and refinanced loans were typically being offered at lower rates. The decline in average outstanding rates had been slightly larger for lenders other than authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), although these rates were still higher on average than those offered by ADIs. ", " Growth in housing credit had eased over the second half of 2017, driven largely by a slowing in lending to investors. Most of the slowing in housing credit growth had been accounted for by the major banks. Members noted that housing lending by non-ADIs had continued to grow strongly, although these lenders' share of housing lending remained small. ", " Financial market pricing suggested that market participants expected the cash rate to remain unchanged during 2018, but had priced in a 25 basis point increase by early 2019. ", " Members were briefed on the emergence of cryptocurrencies and on developments in distributed ledger technology more broadly, as well as their implications for the financial system. They discussed how these developments might affect the operation of the financial system and the potential technical and policy issues that might emerge for central banks and other regulators. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the flow of data since the previous meeting, for both the international economy and Australia, had been generally positive. Conditions in the global economy had continued to improve. A number of advanced economies were growing at an above-trend rate, unemployment rates were low and the outlook had been upgraded by most forecasters. The synchronised nature of the pick-up in growth across economies, to above-trend rates in many cases, had led to more confidence that inflationary pressures would start to build. Although inflation remained low, some upstream price pressures, particularly in commodity markets, had emerged. If global inflation were to pick up by more than expected, it would have implications for financial market pricing and exchange rates. Despite recent increases in the volatility of equity prices around the world, financial conditions continued to be accommodative, with bond yields and credit spreads remaining at low levels. ", " Domestically, business conditions had improved over 2017 but growth in consumption had continued at a relatively modest pace, constrained by low household income growth despite stronger-than-expected employment growth and a decline in the unemployment rate over 2017. Even with the strength in the labour market, wage growth was yet to pick up. Inflation also remained low, but was expected to increase gradually as the economy strengthened and wage pressures rose over the forecast period. Strong competition in the retail sector, which had placed downward pressure on the prices of consumer durables and food for some time, was expected to persist in the next few years. ", " Housing market conditions had generally eased in areas where growth had earlier been strong, especially in Sydney. Tighter credit standards, as a result of supervisory measures implemented by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, had been helpful in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets and housing credit growth had eased, particularly for investors. However, household debt levels remained elevated and members agreed that household balance sheets still warranted careful monitoring. ", " Over 2017, progress had been made in reducing the unemployment rate and bringing inflation closer to target. The low level of interest rates was continuing to play a role in achieving this outcome. Further progress on these goals was expected over the period ahead but the increase in inflation was likely to occur only gradually as the economy strengthened; the Bank's central forecast for the Australian economy was for GDP growth to pick up to average a little above 3 per cent over the next two years and for CPI inflation to be a little above 2 per cent in 2018. Members observed that an appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than forecast. ", " Taking into account the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 5 June 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Wendy Craik AM, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Catherine Tanna ", "Nigel Ray (Deputy Secretary, Macroeconomic Group, Treasury) attended in place of John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury) in terms of section 22 of the <cite>Reserve Bank Act 1959</cite>. ", "Members granted leave of absence to Carol Schwartz AM in terms of section 18A of the <cite>Reserve Bank Act 1959</cite>. "], "Others Present": ["Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Bradley Jones (Head, International Department) Merylin Coombs (Deputy Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", "Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary)"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the March quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. Based on indicators for the quarter received to date, GDP growth was expected to have picked up to be at least 2¾ per cent over the year because export volumes were expected to have recovered after weakness in the December quarter. Growth was also expected to have been supported by consumption, public demand and business investment. ", "Early indicators for the June quarter suggested that surveyed business conditions had remained at their highest levels since the start of the global financial crisis a decade earlier, but consumption had been less buoyant. Growth in retail sales had been moderate in April; reports from the Bank's liaison program suggested that unseasonably warm weather had partly explained relatively subdued outcomes for sales of clothing in particular and at department stores more generally. ", "Preliminary data suggested that dwelling investment had picked up in the March quarter. Information from the Bank's liaison program suggested that demand for detached houses had remained strong, while off-the-plan apartment sales had slowed considerably as a result of weaker investor and foreign demand. Capacity constraints appeared to have limited the pace of work in higher-density construction, particularly in Sydney. The amount of building work in the pipeline remained high, and had increased recently in Victoria; the pipeline of work was expected to support a high level of dwelling investment for some time yet. ", "Conditions in the established housing market appeared to have eased further in Sydney and Melbourne. Housing prices had fallen a little in both cities, particularly for more expensive dwellings. Members observed that falls in housing prices in Melbourne had been concentrated in inner-city areas, whereas the declines in Sydney had been more widespread. Members noted that, nonetheless, housing prices were still 40 per cent higher in Sydney and Melbourne than at the beginning of 2014, while housing prices in Perth had fallen by around 10 per cent over the same period. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had fallen to their lowest levels in a number of years. ", "Public demand was expected to have grown significantly faster than expenditure in other parts of the economy in the March quarter. Both public consumption and public investment, which includes investment in infrastructure projects, were expected to have contributed. The Australian Government budget, tabled in May, had announced $25 billion in infrastructure spending, although some of this was conditional on state government funding and was expected to commence some years later; in general, both federal and state government budgets suggested that infrastructure investment was likely to continue to support growth for some time. Stronger economic conditions had resulted in the Australian Government's underlying cash deficit for 2018/19 being smaller than earlier projections. ", "The March quarter capital expenditure (Capex) survey suggested that non-mining business investment had continued to grow; investment in machinery &amp; equipment had been stronger than expected in the March quarter, while non-residential construction activity had declined. Non-residential construction activity was expected to ease further in 2018/19, based on data from the Capex survey and the decline in non-residential building approvals in the first few months of 2018. Members observed that the Capex survey did not suggest a further pick-up in machinery &amp; equipment investment, but they noted that the survey does not provide information on intangible investments or investment in some parts of the services sector, including education and health. Members also noted that profits in the non-mining sector as a share of output had been resilient, which was positive for future investment. Mining investment was still expected to fall over the subsequent few quarters, as construction of the remaining large liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects reached completion. ", "Members noted that labour market conditions had eased a little in recent months. Looking through the monthly volatility in the labour force data, members observed that employment growth had slowed from a very fast pace in 2017 to something closer to the rate of growth in the working-age population. However, forward-looking indicators of labour demand had continued to point to employment growth increasing to above-average rates in coming months. The unemployment rate had been broadly steady at around 5½ per cent since mid 2017, suggesting that spare capacity remained in the labour market. The ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed workers had remained well below levels seen a decade earlier, which also signalled spare capacity in the labour market. ", "Wages had continued to grow at a low and stable rate. The wage price index had increased by 2.1 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Wages growth had remained faster in the household services industries, particularly in healthcare and education (where a majority of employees are paid under collective wage agreements), than in other sectors. The Fair Work Commission had awarded a 3.5 per cent increase in the minimum wage and higher-classification award wages, which would boost wage outcomes in the September quarter. More broadly, members noted that there had been some evidence of increased wage pressures in some areas of the economy. An increased share of firms in the Bank's liaison program had reported that they expected wages growth to pick up and liaison contacts had continued to report pockets of wage pressures in construction and IT roles for which there had been skill shortages. In addition, a larger number of firms had reported greater difficulty in hiring workers with the requisite skills. ", "Members noted that export volumes were estimated to have increased strongly in the March quarter, partly unwinding the fall following supply disruptions in the December quarter. LNG production was expected to contribute to growth over the following year or so before levelling out at a high level. Exports of some other resources used extensively in renewable energy generation and battery storage, such as copper and lithium, were expected to contribute to growth over this period, but to a much smaller extent than had iron ore, coal and LNG in recent years. ", "Concerns about the durability of Chinese steel demand had eased and demand for Australia's bulk commodities was expected to remain strong in the near term. This had contributed to a recovery in coking coal prices; by contrast, iron ore prices had been little changed over the prior month. Overall, bulk commodity prices had increased a little since the previous meeting. Sustained strength in bulk commodity prices had contributed to a rise in the growth of mining sector profits and the terms of trade in the March quarter. Oil prices had increased earlier in May to their highest level since 2014, but had fallen back in the period leading up to the meeting. ", "Members discussed a range of longer-term demographic developments. They noted that Australia had experienced strong population growth over the preceding decade or so, in large part driven by net overseas migration of younger people. The composition of net overseas migration had affected the age structure of the population. As a result, Australia's median age and old-age dependency ratios were projected to increase by less than those of other advanced economies, despite a relatively high life expectancy. This would make Australia one of the youngest populations within this group of countries. Demographic trends varied by state. For much of the preceding decade, population growth had been particularly strong in Victoria and less so, though still relatively high, in New South Wales, and the median age had declined in these states. The mining investment boom had had a noticeable influence on demographic patterns in Western Australia and Queensland over the 2000s. ", "Members observed that the increase in Australia's population and the changes to its demographic characteristics had led to significant changes in labour supply and demand for housing. Over the prior decade, females in most age groups and males aged over 55 years had increased their participation in the labour force by enough to offset the effects of the ageing of the population. Members noted that changes in policy settings and societal attitudes were likely to have played an important role in these participation decisions. Differences in demographic developments helped to explain some of the differences in housing investment cycles across states. Members observed that continuing investment in infrastructure was required to service Australia's larger population. "], "International Economic Conditions": ["Members noted that global economic conditions had remained solid. While growth appeared to have eased a little in the major advanced economies early in the year, more recently growth had strengthened in China and global activity indicators, such as growth in industrial production and survey measures, had remained consistent with an ongoing expansion. In the advanced economies, there had been further evidence of tightening capacity constraints, which were expected to translate into higher inflation over time. Inflation in the emerging economies had remained relatively low. The prospect of additional tariff measures being introduced, either by the US administration or in response to its actions, continued to present a downside risk to the global economic outlook. Increased political uncertainty in Italy and concerns about the economic prospects of some emerging markets, notably Argentina, Brazil and Turkey, had led to increased volatility in some financial market prices. ", "In China, recent indicators suggested economic conditions had strengthened modestly in April. Growth in industrial production had picked up and steel production had increased, supported by high margins as well as ongoing demand for steel from the construction sector. Activity in the housing sector had been resilient, partly because growth in housing demand had remained strong in cities where tightening measures were not in place. However, growth in infrastructure investment had slowed, which partly reflected tighter funding conditions for local governments. Growth in bank lending had remained steady, while the provision of alternative sources of financing had continued to contract in the face of tighter regulation and stronger enforcement. ", "Growth in India had picked up to be close to 8 per cent in year-ended terms. Members noted that government efforts to support investment had contributed to this strength. India's ability to boost its business service exports over recent years was also viewed as an indicator of brighter prospects for future growth. GDP growth in Korea had picked up in the March quarter as a result of stronger domestic demand. Members observed that many economies in east Asia, including Taiwan and Korea, had benefited from the pick-up in demand for electronics in recent years and the resulting increase in trade through global supply chains. ", "Inflation had generally remained low in the Asia-Pacific region. It had picked up in India to be above the Reserve Bank of India's 4 per cent target, but had eased further in New Zealand, partly reflecting low imported inflation and subdued wage pressures. ", "In the major advanced economies, GDP growth had eased in the March quarter, after strengthening over recent years, but had still been strong enough to continue to absorb spare capacity. Unemployment rates in the United States, Japan and Germany had fallen to their lowest levels in several decades and the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people had continued to rise in many advanced economies. Although wages growth had picked up in all the major advanced economies, it had increased by less than historical experience would imply, given the extent of labour market tightness. Core inflation had remained low in Japan and the euro area, but had increased to be close to target in the United States. ", "Some slowing in US economic growth had been expected because the boost to consumption and investment in the December quarter from the post-hurricane recovery had passed. Surveys and labour market indicators nonetheless had confirmed that the underlying momentum in the US economy had remained strong ahead of the sizeable fiscal stimulus that was scheduled for 2018 and 2019. The US labour market had continued to tighten and reports that it was difficult to find people to hire had become widespread. Members noted that evidence of wage pressures building in the United States had become clearer over recent months. ", "The easing of growth in the March quarter in Japan and the euro area had partly reflected bad weather and other temporary factors. In Japan, consumption and investment growth were expected to be supported by strong business conditions, the tight labour market, accommodative monetary policy and the global economic upswing. In the euro area, however, surveys suggested that business conditions had eased somewhat, and that this had continued into the June quarter. Members noted that political uncertainty in Italy could also weigh on confidence in the euro area. Members observed that real GDP per capita in Italy was lower than before the global financial crisis and that the Italian unemployment rate had declined only marginally after nearly doubling following the onset of the crisis. "], "Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that, while global financial conditions had remained expansionary, political risk in the euro area and instability in some emerging markets had come into greater focus. International trade policy developments in the United States had also remained a concern for market participants. ", "Political uncertainty in Italy had been accompanied by a significant increase in Italian bond yields and a decline in the price of Italian bank stocks. Members noted that the bulk of Italian government debt is held domestically and that Italian banks hold a substantial amount of Italian government debt relative to their assets. The longer-term fiscal and economic challenges facing Italy were discussed. Members noted that measures of sovereign risk, as reflected in the yield spread of Italian over German bonds, had remained well below levels recorded in the 2011–12 episode of instability in the euro area. There had been limited signs of spillovers to other euro area sovereign markets. It was also noted that a change of government in Spain had not generated disruptive effects in financial markets there. ", "Members observed that long-term government bond yields for a number of major sovereign issuers, including Australia, had declined in May. In the euro area, the fall in German yields had reflected, in part, the effect of safe-haven flows and an easing in growth momentum in the euro area. In the United States, 10-year bond yields had traded in a wide range before finishing slightly lower for the month, reflecting a modest reduction in expectations for policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. ", "Members noted that central bank policy settings in the major advanced economies had been unchanged since the previous meeting. The US Federal Reserve had continued gradually to reduce the size of its balance sheet, in accordance with its earlier announced plans, while the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan had maintained asset purchases consistent with their highly accommodative policy settings. ", "Members noted that conditions in US dollar short-term money markets had eased since early April, although they remained tighter than in 2017. A similar profile had been evident in Australian money markets, although interest rate spreads had begun to pick up again in recent days. It was also noted that corporate bond spreads in the advanced economies had remained low. Movements in global equity markets had been mixed over the preceding month. While US equity prices had been supported by strong corporate earnings, Chinese markets had been little changed and European markets had been weighed down by declines in equity prices of financial institutions. Australian equity prices had been largely unchanged over May; increases in resource stocks had been underpinned by higher commodity prices, while the equity prices of Australian financial institutions had declined. ", "Members also discussed developments in emerging markets, noting that problems in a few countries had largely reflected idiosyncratic weaknesses and that spillovers to Asia had been limited to date. In particular, large current account and budget deficits, high inflation and political uncertainty in Argentina and Turkey had contributed to substantial exchange rate depreciations and widening bond spreads over US Treasuries in those countries. Central banks had intervened in foreign exchange markets in an effort to stem further depreciation and they had raised their policy interest rates. Argentina had also sought financial support from the International Monetary Fund. In Brazil, authorities had intervened to slow the depreciation of the real in the context of heightened political and fiscal uncertainty and high levels of debt. The Mexican peso had depreciated in response to developments in Argentina and Brazil, as well as uncertainty over the future of Mexico's trading relationship with the United States and the upcoming presidential election. ", "By contrast, financial markets in the Asian region had been generally resilient. Bank Indonesia had raised policy rates twice in the second half of May and intervened in the foreign exchange and bond markets in order to dampen volatility; the rupiah had depreciated only modestly over the course of 2018. Despite considerable uncertainty over international trade developments, Chinese financial asset prices, including the renminbi exchange rate, had been relatively stable, and authorities had continued to take measures to reduce risks in the financial system. ", "The Australian dollar had been little changed over the prior month and thus had remained in the range seen over the preceding two years. ", "Members noted that housing loan approvals had eased in recent months, driven by approvals to investors, although approvals for owner-occupiers had also declined. This was consistent with an easing in the demand for credit as well as lenders tightening their lending standards. Members noted that banks had recently started to collect more information from loan applicants on living expenses to assess a borrower's capacity to service a loan based on actual living expenses, rather than relying on a proxy measure of minimum expenses based on survey benchmarks. Members noted that, while there may be some further tightening of lending standards affecting housing credit growth in the period ahead, any such tightening was expected to be modest. At the same time, lenders had been competing for high-quality borrowers, which had led to a decline of around 15 basis points in the average mortgage interest rate on outstanding loans since August 2017. Slightly higher funding costs for banks appeared to have had little effect on mortgage rates. ", "Pricing in money markets implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period, with a 25 basis point increase not expected before the second half of 2019. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that conditions in the global economy had strengthened over the prior year. Output in China had grown solidly, which had supported demand for Australia's resource exports and commodity prices. At the same time, Chinese authorities had continued to implement policies to manage risks in the financial sector and ensure the sustainability of future growth. Growth in the major advanced economies had eased a little in the first quarter of 2018, but underlying momentum in these economies had still been consistent with above-trend growth. Wage pressures were increasing, particularly in the United States and Japan, where labour market conditions were very tight by historical standards. ", "Growth in global output was expected to continue to absorb spare capacity, leading to a lift in inflation. As a result, a number of central banks had withdrawn some monetary stimulus and further steps in this direction were expected. Conditions in US dollar short-term money markets were tighter than they had been a year earlier. Although these higher rates had flowed through to higher short-term interest rates in a few other economies, including Australia, overall financial conditions globally remained expansionary. Members noted that the direction of trade policy in the United States continued to be uncertain. In addition, concerns about political developments in Italy and developments in some emerging market economies had affected some financial prices. The Australian dollar had been relatively unaffected by these developments and had remained within the range it had been in for the preceding two years. ", "Members noted that recent data had been consistent with the Bank's central forecast for GDP growth to pick up to be above 3 per cent by the end of 2018. Business conditions were positive and non-mining business investment was expected to increase. Public spending, including on infrastructure, and exports were also expected to support growth. While consumption was expected to grow at a broadly stable rate in the near term, the outlook for consumption growth continued to be a source of uncertainty, given that household income growth had been slow and debt levels remained high. ", "Employment had grown strongly over the previous year, but the unemployment rate had been little changed because strong labour demand had been met by people entering the labour force or delaying retirement. Although employment growth had slowed over recent months, forward-looking indicators suggested employment would continue to grow faster than the working-age population over the period ahead and that, as a result, there would be a gradual decline in the unemployment rate. Although wages growth had remained low, members noted that there had been more evidence that employers were having difficulty hiring workers with the requisite skills and that wage pressures were building in some parts of the economy. ", "Inflation remained low and was likely to remain so for some time, reflecting slow growth in labour costs and strong competition in the retail sector. However, a gradual pick-up in inflation to be above 2 per cent was still expected as the economy strengthens and wages growth increases. An appreciation of the exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast. ", "Conditions had continued to ease in established housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne and had remained subdued in most other capital cities. Growth in housing credit had slowed over the preceding year, especially to investors. An easing in the demand for credit as well the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's supervisory measures and tighter credit standards had been helpful in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets, although the level of household debt remained high. While there might be some further tightening of lending standards in the period ahead, the average mortgage interest rate on outstanding loans had declined over the previous year. ", "The low level of interest rates was continuing to support the Australian economy. Further progress in the period ahead in reducing unemployment and returning inflation to the target was therefore expected, although this progress was likely to be gradual. In the current circumstances and taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

The quarterly growth rate of 1 per cent had been a little stronger than the Bank's forecast of three months earlier. Non-farm GDP had increased by 3.6 per cent over the year to the March quarter, while growth in domestic final demand had continued its upward trend since 2013. ", " Consumption growth had been fairly subdued in the March quarter, following strong growth in the previous quarter. Members noted the volatility in recent quarterly outcomes but that, over the year, household consumption had increased by close to 3 per cent. Consumption of goods had been stronger than consumption of services. Growth in the value of retail sales had been moderate in April and liaison with retailers suggested that underlying trading conditions had been stable. ", " Members observed that, compared with the average of the preceding 20 years, growth in household income had remained subdued over the most recent couple of years, with growth in all components of income remaining below average. Nevertheless, growth in labour income had increased to its highest rate since 2012, in line with solid growth in employment. Measures of growth in average hourly wages had also increased. Nonetheless, wages growth remained low, consistent with ongoing spare capacity in the labour market and some structural forces that had also been evident in other economies. Growth in other sources of household income, including income from government assistance, investments and rent, had continued to be weak, as over the prior couple of years. ", " Turning to the housing market, members noted that data from the national accounts suggested dwelling investment had peaked in late 2016, although residential construction cycles had differed significantly across the states. In New South Wales, dwelling investment in higher-density projects had remained at a high level since the beginning of 2016. Liaison contacts had suggested there were capacity constraints in Sydney, which meant that, given the large amount of work in the pipeline in New South Wales, construction activity was likely to remain at a high level for some time. Dwelling investment in Victoria was also likely to remain at a high level for some time. Members noted that more of this activity had been in detached dwellings and that ‘greenfield’ land sites had generally been more readily available in Victoria. By contrast, the construction cycle for apartments had clearly passed its peak in Queensland, while detached housing construction in Western Australia might have reached a trough. ", " In established housing markets, housing prices had declined in Sydney and Melbourne following significant increases in previous years. Housing prices had fallen by almost 5 per cent in Sydney over the preceding year. Members observed that prices in Sydney and Melbourne had fallen the most for more expensive properties, while prices of lower-priced properties had been little changed, consistent with the typical pattern of larger fluctuations in prices at the higher end of the market. In the other state capitals, housing prices had been fairly steady, with the exception of Hobart, where prices had picked up markedly given strong demand and supply constraints. ", " In the labour market, employment growth had moderated from the very strong rates recorded in 2017 and the participation rate had declined a little from its recent peak. Members noted that most of the jobs created over the preceding year had been in the private sector. Much of the strength in employment growth over recent years had been in the health and social assistance industry, where about three-quarters of people work in the private sector. In recent quarters, employment had expanded in a broader range of industries, including construction, manufacturing and professional, scientific and technical services. The unemployment rate had ticked down to 5.4 per cent in May and had remained in a narrow range around 5½ per cent over the preceding year. This suggested that there continued to be excess capacity in the labour market, as did indicators such as the underutilisation rate. ", " Members observed that some indicators of demand for labour were at high levels. The Australian Bureau of Statistics measure of job vacancies had reached its highest level as a share of the labour force since the late 1970s, when the series commenced, and measures of firms' hiring intentions from business surveys had been strong. However, there had been less momentum in leading indicators of labour demand based on job advertisements. Overall, leading indicators of labour demand pointed to above-average employment growth over the second half of 2018. Consistent with this, members noted that wage pressures had been building in some parts of the economy but had not yet become broadly based. ", " The public sector had continued to contribute noticeably to GDP growth in the March quarter. Public investment had increased strongly over the year, supported by spending on transport infrastructure, and the pipeline of work to be done had increased. Public consumption had also grown, partly reflecting spending associated with implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The consolidated budget balance for the federal and state governments indicated slightly smaller cash deficits over the coming two years than had been expected six months previously. ", " Private non-mining business investment had increased in the March quarter, to be 10 per cent higher over the year. Growth in machinery and equipment investment had picked up, and information from the Bank's liaison program had suggested that the current and prospective strength in public infrastructure investment had improved the investment outlook for many private sector firms in the construction industry. Members noted that private infrastructure investment, including investment in telecommunications and renewable energy, had also increased in the March quarter. Data on approvals in recent months suggested that construction of non-residential buildings was likely to make a smaller contribution to growth in non-mining business investment in future. Mining investment had declined further in the March quarter, as construction work at some liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects neared completion. However, investment in machinery and equipment in the mining sector had increased, following a period of cost-cutting that had led to deferral of some investment. Recent survey measures of business conditions had continued to be at levels well above average. ", " Export volumes had increased strongly in the March quarter. Coal export volumes had rebounded following resolution of earlier supply disruptions and LNG exports had risen strongly as projects in Western Australia ramped up production. In April, volumes of LNG, iron ore and thermal coal exports had increased, while the volume of coking coal exports had declined as a result of weather-related disruptions to supply. ", " Australia's terms of trade had risen by 3.3 per cent in the March quarter, which was a little more than had been expected a few months earlier. The prices of coking and thermal coal had increased since the previous meeting, supported by higher demand from Asia and various constraints on supply in some of the largest exporting economies. Iron ore prices had been little changed over the previous month and were within their range of the preceding few years. Members noted that wool prices had increased significantly, but that wool represented quite a small share of Australia's total exports. Base metals prices had declined over the previous month in response to heightened trade tensions. Most other commodity prices had been little changed since the previous meeting. ", " Members held a detailed discussion of the high level of household debt in Australia, informed by a special paper prepared for this meeting. Household debt has increased by more than household income over the preceding three decades in many countries, but particularly so in Australia. Two key drivers of this trend across countries have been the decline in nominal interest rates, predominantly reflecting lower inflation, and financial deregulation, both of which have increased households' access to finance. Members noted that a distinguishing feature of the Australian housing market is that the bulk of dwellings are owned by the household sector. This has contributed to greater borrowing for housing by households in Australia compared with other countries, where the corporate sector owns a larger proportion of rental properties. Another feature of the Australian housing market that has contributed to greater borrowing by households is the higher cost of housing in Australia on account of a larger share of the Australian population living in urban centres, typically in large detached dwellings. ", " Survey data indicate that much of Australian household debt is owed by higher-income and middle-aged people, who tend to have more stable employment and often larger savings buffers. However, members recognised that a material share of household debt is held by lower-income households, which generally have higher debt relative to their income. Household assets in aggregate are valued at around five times the value of household debt and total assets exceed the value of debt for most households. Members noted, however, that most household assets are housing and superannuation, and that both of these are illiquid. ", " Members noted that high levels of household debt could affect economic outcomes. For example, households with high debt levels are more vulnerable to economic shocks and therefore more likely to reduce consumption in the face of uncertainty about their future income. Members also noted that changes in interest rates have a larger effect on disposable income for households with high debt levels, but that these households may be less inclined to borrow more at times when interest rates fall. Accordingly, members agreed that household balance sheets continued to warrant close and careful monitoring. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Conditions in the global economy had generally remained positive. Surveyed business conditions had been above average and growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade had been solid, although below the rates seen in 2017. Domestic demand had also remained quite strong in most regions, supported by varying combinations of accommodative monetary policy and increasingly stimulatory fiscal policy. ", " Some of the downside risks to the global growth outlook had increased over the prior month. Additional tariff measures had been confirmed in a number of economies in prior weeks and the prospect of further measures being introduced appeared to have become more likely. Members noted that trade tensions extended beyond the United States and China, and could escalate through non-tariff measures such as administrative delays. An escalation of trade tensions could harm global growth by undermining confidence and delaying investment decisions and could dampen international trade. ", " In China, indicators of economic activity had been mixed in May. Growth in retail sales had fallen sharply, while growth in some categories of industrial output had continued to strengthen. In particular, strong demand for steel had supported prices at high levels and encouraged production. This, in turn, had underpinned demand for Australian exports of coal and iron ore. Housing prices had been flat or falling in the largest Chinese cities, where restrictions on housing purchases have been most stringent, but had risen rapidly in smaller cities. Investment in real estate had picked up but most of this had been land purchases rather than construction. Infrastructure investment had weakened, which was likely in part to have reflected ongoing efforts to reform local government finances. Members noted that infrastructure investment activity could recover in coming months, given that many local authorities still have capacity to issue more bonds. Growth in total social financing had been steady in May and Chinese regulators had recently introduced additional measures to strengthen oversight of the banking sector. ", " In other east Asian economies, GDP growth had been robust in the March quarter. More recent data suggested this pace was likely to have continued in the June quarter. While exports had continued to contribute significantly to growth in the region, domestic demand factors had become increasingly important. ", " In the major advanced economies, GDP growth had remained above trend rates. In the United States and Japan, growth looked to have increased in the June quarter, following lower outcomes in the March quarter. In the euro area, however, some indicators of activity had softened further in recent months, suggesting a weaker near-term outlook than in the other two major economies. This slowing had been broadly based across euro area member countries. ", " Labour markets had continued to tighten across all three major advanced economies. Employment growth had been higher than growth in the working-age population for some time and unemployment rates had fallen to be well below estimates consistent with full employment in some economies. Wages growth had picked up gradually in response. This had supported the outlook for consumption growth in these economies and was expected to lead to rising inflationary pressures. Core inflation had been close to the Federal Reserve's target in the United States, where demand was likely to have been boosted by the effects of recent reductions in corporate and personal income tax rates. Core inflation had remained below target in both Japan and the euro area, although in the latter case higher oil prices had meant that CPI inflation was at the level targeted by the European Central Bank (ECB). "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that overall global financial conditions remained supportive of economic activity. However, financial market participants remained focused on risks arising from international trade tensions, political developments in Europe and strains in some emerging market economies. ", " Members noted that the major central banks were at different phases of their monetary policy cycles. The Federal Reserve was most advanced in withdrawing monetary stimulus, consistent with the relative strength in economic activity and inflation in the US economy. By contrast, the ECB and Bank of Japan had continued to ease policy through ongoing asset purchases, further expanding their balance sheets. Moreover, both central banks had maintained negative policy rates. ", " In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at its June meeting, as had been widely expected. The median of FOMC members' projections for the federal funds rate had been revised upwards slightly since the March FOMC meeting, implying a faster increase over 2018. While the federal funds rate was projected to move above FOMC members' estimates of its long-run neutral level by the end of 2019, sooner than in the previous projections, the median projection for the end of 2020 was unchanged at around ½ percentage point above the long-run neutral level. Members noted that market expectations for the federal funds rate remained below those of FOMC members. ", " The Bank of Canada and Bank of England were also expected by market participants to take further steps to withdraw some monetary stimulus in coming months, although if that came to pass their policy rates would remain accommodative. At its June meeting, the ECB Governing Council announced its intention to wind down its net asset purchase program by the end of 2018, which would bring an end to the ECB's easing cycle, while maintaining the current level of negative policy rates at least through the (northern hemisphere) summer of 2019. ", " Members observed that the cash rate in Australia was higher than the policy rates of the major central banks, with the exception of the Federal Reserve, and that the Reserve Bank's balance sheet had been little changed since the global financial crisis, compared with the significant balance sheet expansions undertaken by some other central banks over that period. ", " Long-term government bond yields in a number of the major markets had declined slightly over June, in part reflecting concerns about international trade policies. However, US long-term yields remained higher than at the end of 2017, consistent with continued robust growth and expectations of rising inflation and further removal of monetary stimulus in the United States. ", " In European markets, sovereign yield spreads over German bonds had declined in Spain, Portugal and Italy, following an easing in earlier political tensions. While spreads in Spain and Portugal had returned to levels observed in 2017, Italian spreads had remained elevated, reflecting ongoing market concerns about the expansionary fiscal plans of the new Italian government. ", " Concerns about rising international trade tensions had weighed on global equity prices, most noticeably in Asian markets. US equity prices had remained high, having risen substantially over 2017, reflecting continued strength in corporate profits. ", " Members noted that the US dollar had appreciated against a broad range of currencies over 2018 in the context of relatively strong US growth prospects and rising US interest rates as the Federal Reserve withdrew monetary stimulus. After appreciating in the earlier part of the year, the Chinese renminbi had depreciated in June, reflecting the broad-based strength in the US dollar as well as international trade tensions and a moderation in economic growth. The Australian dollar had depreciated over 2018, largely against the US dollar, but remained within the range it had traded in over the preceding couple of years. ", " Problems in a few emerging market economies had resulted in local financial market stresses, particularly in Argentina, Turkey and Brazil. Members noted that the International Monetary Fund had approved a larger-than-expected financial assistance package for Argentina. Stresses in other emerging markets had generally been limited, although capital outflows had picked up in the recent period. Members noted that volatility in financial markets, both in emerging economies and more generally, had risen a little in prior months but remained close to longer-run averages. ", " In China, authorities had continued to take measures to contain risks in the financial system and overall credit growth had eased further. Members noted, however, that the People's Bank of China had recently reduced banks' required reserve ratios to assist banks in making progress on debt-for-equity swaps or increasing lending to small and micro-sized enterprises. ", " Turning to domestic financial conditions, members noted that Australian long-term bond yields had moved broadly in line with developments in global markets in recent months and remained below US long-term bond yields. Money market rates in Australia had also been moving broadly in line with those in international markets earlier in the year, but in the weeks preceding the meeting had increased independently of other markets. Members observed that this was consistent with the recent pattern of rising funding pressures at the end of each calendar quarter, and noted that it was uncertain how persistent these pressures would be. As a result, funding costs for the major banks had risen a little over 2018, reflecting the higher bank bill swap rate over this period, but had remained low relative to history. Banks' net bond issuance in 2018 had been strong. ", " Housing credit growth had continued to slow in May. The slowing in housing credit growth over the prior year had been driven largely by slower growth in lending to investors, which had declined to the lowest rate since early 2016. Members discussed the important role that demand factors had played in slowing the pace of borrowing. A softening in demand for housing credit in the context of high household debt levels was consistent with the slowing growth, and in some markets outright falls, that had been seen in housing prices. Declines in advertised interest rates for new borrowers by some banks had also suggested some softening in demand for credit. Members noted, however, that there had also been some tightening in supply of credit as a result of tighter lending standards. ", " In recent months, the major banks had announced lower interest rates for some new loans, including some loan products for investors and interest-only loans. Some smaller banks had increased their advertised standard variable mortgage rates over the previous month. Members observed that, while changes in advertised housing lending rates had not been in a particular direction overall, lending rates for new and outstanding variable housing loans had drifted downwards over much of the prior year. ", " Members noted that, although growth in Australian business debt had increased from a year earlier, it remained moderate as businesses tend to rely on internal funding for investment. On an accumulation basis, Australian share prices had generally moved in line with international markets over recent years but had outperformed other markets in June. Company profits were generally expected to continue growing, especially in the resources sector, which had benefited from higher commodity prices. ", " Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the global economic expansion had continued. A number of advanced economies were growing at an above-trend rate and experiencing increasingly tight labour market conditions. Growth in the Chinese economy appeared to have moderated a little, and there was some uncertainty around how the authorities there would respond given the trade-offs involved in achieving the target for output growth and managing financial stability risks. Concerns about the direction of international trade policy in the United States and its effect on the global outlook had intensified over the prior month. Strains had continued in a few emerging market economies, largely for country-specific reasons, which had affected some financial market pricing, although spillovers to other markets had been limited. Concerns about political developments in several European countries had generally eased over the prior month, although concerns about political developments in Italy had remained. ", " There had been further evidence of rising wage pressures in the major economies where labour market conditions had been tight. Strong global growth had also contributed to higher commodity prices in early 2018, which had increased upstream inflationary pressures and boosted Australia's terms of trade. However, core inflation had remained below most central banks' targets, with the exception of the United States, where it had increased to be around the Federal Reserve's target. ", " Globally, financial conditions had remained expansionary, although they were gradually becoming less so in some economies. Given current and prospective economic conditions, the Federal Reserve was expected to increase the federal funds rate over 2018 and 2019; this had contributed to a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. Against this background, the Australian dollar had depreciated a little, but remained within the range it had traded in over the previous two years. ", " The recent data on the Australian economy had been consistent with the Bank's central forecast for GDP growth to pick up to be a bit above 3 per cent over 2018 and 2019. Non-mining business investment had contributed significantly to growth in the March quarter, as had public infrastructure investment, and business conditions had remained positive. The outlook for consumption remained a source of uncertainty for the GDP forecasts, given that household income had continued to grow slowly and debt levels were high. ", " The outlook for the labour market had remained positive. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand continued to point to solid growth in employment; most notably, the vacancy rate had risen to a historically high level. These conditions were expected to lead to a gradual decline in the unemployment rate. Although wages growth was expected to remain low in the near term, stronger labour market conditions and growing skills shortages were expected to lead to wages growth picking up over time. ", " Housing prices had fallen moderately in Sydney and Melbourne, following significant growth over preceding years, and had been little changed over the preceding six months in other cities on average. Housing credit growth had declined, mainly because investor demand had slowed noticeably. Lending standards were tighter than they had been a few years previously and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's supervisory measures were helping to contain the build-up of risk in household balance sheets. Some further tightening of lending standards by banks was possible, although the average mortgage interest rate on outstanding loans had been declining for some time. ", " The low level of interest rates was continuing to support the Australian economy. Inflation remained low, reflecting low growth in labour costs and strong competition in retailing. Members continued to view the strengthening economy as likely to deliver further progress in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation to target. In these circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate would more likely be an increase than a decrease. However, since progress towards a lower unemployment rate and an inflation rate closer to the midpoint of the target range was likely to be gradual, they also agreed there was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, the Board assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress unfolds. ", " Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 2 October 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Wendy Craik AM, Philip Gaetjens, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna ", " Members granted leave of absence to Mark Barnaba AM in terms of section 18A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959. "], "Others Present": [" Michele Bullock (Assistant Governor, Financial System), Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Jonathan Kearns (Head, Financial Stability Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that GDP growth in many of Australia's trading partners had continued at an above-trend pace in the first half of 2018. Although timely measures of global activity had recently eased somewhat, global growth was expected to remain solid over the following couple of years. Members noted that developments in trade policies continued to pose significant risks to this outlook. While the United States had concluded trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico, additional tariff measures had been implemented by the United States and China in the weeks leading up to the meeting. To date, the tariffs imposed on US imports of Chinese products had affected capital goods and industrial inputs proportionately more than consumer goods. ", " In the United States, GDP growth had remained strong in the first half of 2018 and, more recently, industrial production growth and surveyed conditions in the manufacturing sector had been robust. The strength in economic activity had partly reflected the fiscal stimulus, which had more than offset any effect of higher tariffs. GDP growth had remained above trend in the euro area and Japan. Growth in output in Japan had been supported by strong growth in investment, which was expected to continue. However, growth in industrial production in Asia had eased, as had growth in exports and new export orders; exports from the euro area to China had also eased. ", " Above-trend growth in the major advanced economies had led to further absorption of spare capacity in their labour markets. As a result, wages growth had increased noticeably. Members observed that minimum wages had been increasing faster than average wages across a number of economies. Most notably, in South Korea minimum wages had increased by more than 15 per cent in 2018 and a further increase of 10 per cent was scheduled for 2019. Members noted that increases in minimum wages of this magnitude could affect employment decisions, although smaller increases, such as the recent increase in Australia, were unlikely to have a material effect on growth in employment. ", " Higher wages growth had contributed to a pick-up in core inflation in a number of advanced economies. Core inflation in the United States had picked up to be around the Federal Reserve's inflation goal. However, core inflation in the euro area and Japan remained subdued. Higher oil prices were expected to contribute to an increase in headline inflation in a number of economies. ", " In China, data received over the previous month had been mixed and continued to suggest that economic activity had remained subdued in some sectors, most notably infrastructure investment. In contrast, manufacturing and real estate investment had edged higher. There were indications that real estate investment might pick up further: housing demand had remained strong; housing prices had increased, particularly in cities where housing policies were less restrictive; and production of construction-related products had been relatively strong. To some extent, the outlook for infrastructure investment depended on government policy and local governments continuing to obtain funding through bond issuance. Overall, total social financing in China had increased a little over recent months. ", " Consumer price inflation in China had picked up, mainly because of higher oil and food prices, while core inflation had remained relatively subdued. Members noted that food and energy make up a relatively large share of Chinese households' consumption and that recent disease- and weather-related supply problems are likely to result in further increases in food prices. ", " The prices of iron ore and coking coal had increased since the previous meeting, partly reflecting strong demand by Chinese steel producers and reports that the upcoming winter restrictions on Chinese steel production might not be as strict as in the previous year. Supply disruptions had also contributed to a recent increase in coking coal prices. Base metals prices had been little changed and remained well below levels of a few months earlier. Oil prices had risen to levels last seen in 2014, partly as a result of lower-than-expected supply. The June quarter national accounts had recorded a modest decline in Australia's terms of trade. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The June quarter national accounts had been released the day after the previous meeting. Real GDP had increased by 0.9 per cent in the quarter, and upward revisions to growth in earlier quarters had taken GDP growth over the year to the June quarter to 3.4 per cent, which was the strongest year-ended rate of growth since 2012. More recent data had pointed to further solid growth in GDP in the September quarter, although growth was expected to have moderated a little from the strong rates recorded over the first half of the year. ", " Household consumption growth had picked up in the June quarter and had remained elevated over the preceding year in the face of the weak income growth reported in the national accounts. Members observed that uncertainty about how consumption would respond if there were an extended period of low income growth, and/or declining housing prices, remained an important consideration for the forecasts. More recently, retail sales values had been flat in July and information from liaison with retailers had continued to point to below-average growth in nominal retail spending. ", " Dwelling investment had increased in the June quarter and over the year. The increase had been concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria, where capacity constraints in the construction industry were apparent. Looking forward, members noted that the decline in residential building approvals since mid 2016 suggested dwelling investment was likely to be close to its peak in the current cycle. Nonetheless, the large pipeline of work yet to be done was expected to support a high level of dwelling investment in the period ahead. ", " In the established housing market, overall conditions had continued to ease gradually. Housing prices had fallen a little further in Sydney and Melbourne in recent months and price declines had become more widespread in both cities. Housing prices had also declined further in Perth, but had been little changed in other mainland capital cities. Rental vacancy rates had declined over the preceding couple of years in all capital cities except Sydney, although the vacancy rate remained high in Perth. ", " Public sector spending had continued to grow relatively strongly, with both public consumption and investment having contributed to GDP growth over the year to the June quarter. Recent data on work yet to be done on infrastructure projects had suggested public investment would remain high over the following couple of years. The final federal budget outcome for 2017/18 revealed that the deficit had been smaller than expected, owing to higher revenue and lower-than-expected spending. ", " Mining investment had risen strongly in the June quarter, partly reflecting higher expenditure on machinery and equipment as well as a sharp increase in exploration activity. Non-mining investment had declined somewhat in the June quarter, but had increased strongly over the preceding year. Overall conditions in the business sector had remained positive. Survey measures of business conditions had remained well above average, despite easing a little since the start of the year. Profits had risen strongly over the preceding year, particularly in the mining sector, where commodity prices had been higher than previously expected and production had risen. There had been a broad-based increase in export volumes in the June quarter, led by rural exports. This had been driven partly by higher meat exports, as drought conditions and rising feed costs for livestock had encouraged higher meat production. Members noted that economic conditions had remained challenging in drought-affected parts of the country. Farm production was expected to decline in 2018/19 because drought conditions in some key farming regions were expected to reduce crop yields. ", " Members noted that employment had risen strongly in August, driven by full-time employment, and employment growth had been stronger than population growth over the year. Employment growth over the preceding year had been strong in business services, while employment in the health and social assistance industry had been relatively stable, having increased strongly in earlier years. Employment in the manufacturing sector had picked up recently. The participation rate had been little changed at a high level in 2018. Having been around 5½ per cent for the preceding year, the unemployment rate had declined a little to 5.3 per cent in July and August. Members noted that spare capacity in the labour market had declined over recent months; youth unemployment rates (that is, for people aged between 15 and 24 years) had fallen, as had the rate for people who had been unemployed for up to a year. The underemployment rate had also edged lower. ", " Job vacancies had increased a little in the September quarter and had remained historically high relative to the size of the labour force. Taken together with other leading indicators of labour demand, such as surveys of firms' employment intentions, this continued to suggest that employment growth would exceed population growth in coming months, which was expected to result in further gradual absorption of spare capacity in the labour market. ", " Despite ongoing improvements in labour market conditions, the national accounts measure of average earnings growth had been weak in the June quarter and had increased by only 2 per cent over the year to the June quarter. Other components of household income, including government transfers, had also recorded below-average growth in the recent period. Members noted that growth in unit labour costs, which adjust hourly earnings for productivity growth, had been subdued for a number of years, averaging less than 1 per cent in year-ended terms and had led to downward pressure on underlying inflation. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that financial conditions in advanced economies remained accommodative, although they were gradually becoming less so in some economies. By contrast, financial conditions had generally tightened in emerging markets in 2018, with a few economies having economic, financial or political vulnerabilities. ", " Members noted the divergence in monetary policy paths among the major central banks, consistent with differences in spare capacity and the inflation outlook across economies. In the United States and Canada, policy accommodation was being removed, with further gradual increases in policy rates widely expected in the coming year. The Federal Reserve had increased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in September, as anticipated; both the median projection of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members and market pricing suggested a further increase in December. The median FOMC projection remained for the federal funds rate to increase to a little above the median FOMC estimate of the neutral level over the subsequent two years. While financial market pricing implied a somewhat higher path for the federal funds rate than was the case a month earlier, this path was still below that implied by the median FOMC projection. ", " Some gradual removal of monetary stimulus was also expected in the United Kingdom, Norway and Sweden, although policy rates in these economies remained very low. Members observed that market pricing implied that policy rates were expected to be steady over the coming year in Australia and New Zealand, where rates had not reached the very low levels observed in some other economies. In Japan, the euro area and Switzerland, maintenance of very stimulatory policy settings, including negative policy rates, was expected for some time. ", " Government bond yields had edged higher in most advanced economies over the previous month, mostly reflecting higher real yields. This was consistent with increased market expectations for further increases in the US federal funds rate. Nevertheless, government bond yields generally remained low by historical standards, with inflation expectations contained and term premia at unusually low levels. Other indicators also pointed to continued accommodative financial conditions in most advanced economies, with credit spreads, equity risk premia and equity market volatility having generally remained low. One notable exception was Italy, where market concerns about the future stance of fiscal policy had resulted in the yield spread of Italian debt over German Bunds increasing sharply following the release of the Italian government's draft budget. ", " Members noted the ongoing financial fragility in Turkey, Argentina and, to a lesser extent, Brazil. There had been substantial exchange rate depreciations and increases in government bond yield spreads in these economies since early 2018. Recently, financial conditions in these economies had stabilised somewhat, although they warranted monitoring, including to the extent that a tightening in financial conditions might spill over more indiscriminately to other emerging markets. In Turkey and Argentina, the central banks had increased policy rates sharply to stem concerns about further exchange rate depreciation given the economies' exposure to foreign currency-denominated debt. The Argentine authorities had reached a provisional agreement with the International Monetary Fund to revise the terms of the financial assistance package agreed earlier in the year. ", " In China, the authorities had implemented fiscal and monetary easing measures in the context of moderating growth. Members noted the targeted and modest nature of the policy measures given policymakers' ongoing commitment to containing vulnerabilities in the financial system. Chinese equity prices had declined substantially earlier in 2018 and the renminbi had depreciated, but both had been relatively stable more recently. ", " Turning to financial developments in Australia, members noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated by around 8 per cent against the US dollar over 2018. This had occurred in the context of US long-term bond yields having moved above those in Australia over this period and notwithstanding some rise in commodity prices more recently. On a trade-weighted basis, the depreciation of the Australian dollar had been more modest, and the trade-weighted index was noted as being in the lower part of the range that had prevailed over the preceding few years. ", " Interest rates on bank bills and other money market instruments had remained above their averages of 2017, but the pattern of temporary sharp rises in these rates towards the end of recent quarters had not been repeated at the end of September. Banks' net bond issuance had remained strong in 2018. Non-financial corporate bond issuance had also been robust in the first half of 2018, although it had been more subdued in the September quarter. At the same time, however, corporate bond spreads had remained low and growth in business credit had picked up a little. ", " Members observed that there had been a modest increase in banks' overall funding costs over the first half of 2018, reflecting the higher cost of debt funding as a result of the increase in money market interest rates; the cost of funding sourced from retail deposits had remained very low over 2018 and had even declined a little recently. ", " Most of the major banks and many other lenders had announced increases in housing lending rates in response to the higher funding costs. This was likely to unwind the decline observed in the average outstanding variable housing lending rate over the preceding year. Growth in housing credit had continued to ease, driven largely by investors, while growth in lending to owner-occupiers had remained relatively strong at 7 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms. Members noted that, on average, interest rates offered on new housing loans remained below interest rates on outstanding loans for owner-occupiers, and even more so for investors, indicating that banks were continuing to compete for new borrowers. ", " Variable interest rates on outstanding loans to large businesses, many of which are directly linked to bank bill swap rates, had increased in line with the increase in bank bill rates over 2018, although they remained very low. The average interest rate on outstanding variable-rate loans to small businesses had been little changed over the preceding year. ", " Australian share prices, even when compared on the basis of accumulation indices (which take account of dividend payments), had underperformed relative to major global markets in the preceding month. Movements in equity prices in Australia had been mixed across different sectors. Share prices of financial corporations had declined, with share prices for the insurance sector having declined over the previous month following developments in the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. By contrast, equity prices in the resources sector had increased, reflecting higher commodity prices. ", " Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system. Overall, financial stability risks were broadly similar to the assessment made six months earlier. ", " Globally, ongoing economic growth had supported financial stability. Banks' improved profitability had enabled them to boost their capital. However, some banks in Europe still had low levels of capital. Banks' asset performance had also improved in most advanced economies. The share of non-performing loans had fallen and in many economies had returned to pre-crisis levels. However, in some economies the share of non-performing loans remained high. Regulatory reforms implemented following the financial crisis had resulted in an increase in banks' capital ratios, which had significantly improved the resilience of the banking system. ", " Members noted that low government bond yields, while having risen somewhat in the United States in recent months, were underpinning the high valuation of many assets. This implied that any sharp increases in long-term interest rates could precipitate significant price falls across broad asset classes. The compensation investors required for bearing risk also remained at low levels. ", " In contrast to advanced economies, in China non-financial corporate debt, relative to GDP, had increased substantially since the financial crisis to a level that was high by international standards. This was a significant financial stability concern. Growth in debt had slowed in the previous couple of years, but the earlier rapid growth in lending had raised concerns about the quality of that lending. The Chinese authorities were continuing to address financial stability risks and these efforts were yielding noticeable results. Specifically, there had been a pronounced slowing in credit provided through non-bank financial institutions and the extent of their linkages with banks was stabilising. ", " Turning their discussion to financial conditions in Australia, members discussed the effect of the tightening of loan serviceability standards implemented over recent years in response to risks in housing lending. They noted that most borrowers took out a loan that was substantially smaller than the maximum loan that lenders were prepared to offer; three-quarters of borrowers had taken out loans that were less than 80 per cent of their maximum borrowing capacity based on serviceability considerations. This suggested that relatively few borrowers would have been constrained by the tightening in lending standards that had reduced maximum loan sizes to date. ", " The two quantitative policy measures that had been implemented in previous years – namely, the investor and interest-only benchmarks – were judged to have been effective in reducing the specific risks they targeted. The rate of growth in lending to investors had declined and remained well below 10 per cent per annum, and the share of interest-only loans in new housing lending had fallen from around 40 per cent to 15 per cent. The share of interest-only loans in the stock of outstanding loans had also declined, in large part because lenders had increased interest rates on existing interest-only loans. ", " Members discussed quantitative analysis undertaken by Reserve Bank staff, which showed that the investor benchmark imposed in 2014 had led to a change in the composition of new lending for housing. In particular, the investor benchmark had resulted in lending to investors growing more slowly but lending to owner-occupiers growing more quickly, with no discernible change in new housing lending in aggregate at the time. Additional analysis indicated that over the preceding few years, the investor benchmark had resulted in slower growth of housing prices in locations with a high share of investors, relative to locations with a low share of investors. While slower growth in housing prices had not been the objective of the policy measures, members noted that the analysis suggested around two-thirds of the difference in growth in housing prices between these regions in recent years could be attributed to the prudential measures. ", " Yields on Australian commercial property had declined over recent years, although spreads to government bond yields were within the range historically observed. Members noted there was strong foreign demand for commercial property, with some foreign investors willing to accept lower yields and hence pay higher prices than domestic investors. Office vacancy rates in Sydney and Melbourne generally were low, which was promoting construction activity. ", " Australian banks' ratio of non-performing housing loans had edged up further over the first half of 2018. The ratio was around the same level observed following the financial crisis, but remained low both in absolute terms and relative to other countries. The vast majority of banks' non-performing loans remained well secured. Much of the increase in non-performing loans had occurred in Western Australia, where economic conditions had been weak. ", " Australian banks' capital ratios had also increased substantially after the onset of the financial crisis. The major banks were close to or already meeting ‘unquestionably strong’ capital levels and other banks were above their regulatory minimums. Members noted that the return on equity for the major banks in Australia remained high relative to that in other countries. In the United States and Japan, return on equity for large banks had settled at around 8–10 per cent, considerably lower than that prevailing before the financial crisis, while the Australian major banks continued to achieve rates of return on equity well above this level. ", " Members discussed the release of the interim report of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The report contains many questions covering a broad range of issues, but at this stage provides relatively little indication of the recommendations that are likely to be made in the final report. Members observed that while the regulators had already overseen a tightening of lending standards, and a degree of tightening of lending standards had been implemented by banks in anticipation of the Commission's findings, it was possible that banks could tighten lending conditions further given the issues raised in the report. Members noted that it would be important to monitor the future supply of credit to ensure that economic activity continued to be appropriately supported. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that global economic conditions had continued to be positive for the Australian economy, although the global economic outlook was subject to a range of risks. Most notably, developments in international trade policy continued to be a source of uncertainty. However, energy and bulk commodity prices had generally remained elevated, which had supported Australia's terms of trade. ", " Members noted that most advanced economies had continued to grow at above-trend rates and labour markets had continued to tighten. This had led to a noticeable increase in wage pressures. Core inflation had picked up in the United States and a number of smaller advanced economies, but had remained subdued in the euro area and Japan. Headline inflation had been boosted by higher oil prices. Although some sectors of the Chinese economy had slowed, the authorities had eased fiscal and monetary policy in a targeted way to support near-term growth, while continuing to pay close attention to financial risks. ", " Against the background of rising global inflationary pressures, a few central banks, including the Federal Reserve, had increased their policy rates in recent months, and the degree of monetary policy accommodation was expected gradually to be reduced. Changes in the expected paths of monetary policy had been reflected in changes to financial market pricing, most notably a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. This appreciation had raised risks for some economies, particularly the more fragile emerging market economies, but the resultant modest depreciation of the Australian dollar was likely to have been helpful for domestic economic growth. ", " Recent data on economic activity in the Australian economy had been generally positive and consistent with the forecast for GDP growth to be above potential over the following two years. GDP growth had been well above potential growth over the year to the June quarter, supported by strong public demand, resource exports, non-mining business investment and steady consumption growth. Employment growth had increased, the participation rate had remained high and the unemployment rate was trending lower. Business conditions had also remained positive, although the drought had led to difficult conditions in parts of the farm sector. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand continued to point to above-average growth in employment in the period ahead and further falls in the unemployment rate. Wages growth was expected to increase gradually as spare capacity in the labour market is absorbed. However, recorded household income growth had been subdued and this continued to be an important source of uncertainty for the outlook for consumption and inflation. ", " Housing prices had declined noticeably in Sydney and Melbourne, following significant growth over preceding years, but had been little changed in most other cities. Housing credit growth had declined, largely as a result of a sizeable slowing in demand from investors. Some lenders had increased their standard variable housing lending rates by small amounts in response to higher money market interest rates, although housing lending rates had been reduced for some new loans. More generally, lending standards had become tighter than they had been a few years previously, partly reflecting the introduction of supervisory measures to help contain the build-up of risk in household balance sheets. Some further tightening of lending standards by banks was possible, although competition for borrowers of high credit quality remained strong. ", " Taking account of the available information, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy would continue to support economic growth and allow for further progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. In these circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate was more likely to be an increase than a decrease. However, since progress on unemployment and inflation was likely to be gradual, they also agreed there was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress unfolds. Therefore, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

"], "International Economic Conditions": [" Since the December Board meeting, there had been a stronger tone to the data on the global economy. Growth in both Asia (excluding Japan) and the United States had picked up, after softening in the middle months of 2010. World output was estimated to have grown by 5 per cent in 2010, which was an above-trend pace, and the IMF was forecasting growth to remain above trend in 2011 and 2012, albeit with some moderation. There were, however, large differences in the amount of spare capacity around the world. In many emerging market economies, spare capacity was limited and inflationary pressures were increasing. In contrast, output in many advanced economies remained at or below pre-crisis levels and unemployment rates remained high. ", " The Chinese economy had continued to grow at a firm pace in the December quarter, with a range of indicators suggesting that the pace of activity had increased over recent months. The main focus of policy in China was the pick-up in inflation, which was running at 4.6 per cent over the year to December. The authorities had announced a range of measures to address the inflationary pressures, although monetary conditions appeared to remain accommodative for such a rapidly growing economy. Food prices had recorded large increases, and this was also the case in a range of other economies in Asia. Members discussed the recent upward trend in global food prices, noting the sharp increase in demand for protein in some emerging economies as a result of the secular growth in incomes, which was also flowing through to the price of grains. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, the recent activity data had generally been positive, with exports and industrial production recording solid rises over the December quarter. Inflation had also increased in a number of economies, although in most cases by less than in China. The authorities in a number of economies had continued to tighten monetary policy over recent months, although real interest rates remained low across the region. ", " In the United States, December quarter GDP growth had been stronger than was expected a few months earlier, with household consumption showing surprising strength and most indicators of investment showing a gradual improvement. Conditions in the labour market had improved only modestly, with the fall that had been seen in the unemployment rate since its peak late in 2009 partly explained by a decline in labour force participation. Conditions in the housing market remained weak. ", " In the euro area, a moderate recovery appeared under way, but large divergences across countries remained. Activity remained soft in those economies where sovereign debt concerns had been elevated. The first estimate for GDP in the December quarter 2010 in the United Kingdom had shown a surprising fall, although this was partly explained by poor weather. ", " The recent growth in global demand and industrial production, together with weather-related disruptions to supply, had seen generalised strength in commodity prices over recent months. Spot prices for coking coal had risen very sharply, in part reflecting the fall in production in Queensland following the floods. The spot price for iron ore was around its record high levels, as was the IMF's index of global food prices. Oil and base metals prices had risen, but remained below their peaks of a few years ago. This generalised increase in commodity prices had led to a further upward revision to the near-term outlook for Australia's terms of trade. ", " While measures of core inflation remained low in most advanced economies, the increase in commodity prices was being reflected in a pick-up in headline inflation rates. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members began the discussion of the domestic economy with a briefing on the impact of the floods that had occurred in December and January in eastern Australia. The floods had damaged parts of the capital stock in the affected regions and disrupted production. The biggest effect on GDP was likely to arise from swings in coal production, with many Queensland mines severely affected by wet weather since December. Preliminary estimates suggested that national coal production would be around 15 per cent lower over the December and March quarters than would otherwise have been the case, though there was considerable uncertainty around this figure. Coal production was, however, expected to bounce back in the June quarter – provided that there was no additional severe flooding – and to increase strongly thereafter as new capacity continued to come on line. ", " While there would also be some short-term deferral of spending by households and businesses, there would be a subsequent boost to activity as the disruptions eased and the repair and replacement of damaged assets got under way. While most production and consumption spending could be expected to rebound fairly quickly, the repair and rebuilding of damaged public and private assets would probably be spread over a number of years. ", " Overall, the staff's preliminary assessment was that the cumulative effect of lost production over the December and March quarters from the floods would result in the level of GDP being around 1 percentage point lower in the March quarter than would otherwise have been the case. By the June quarter, GDP was likely to have largely recovered to where it would have been in the absence of the floods, and would then be slightly above the pre-flood baseline as the rebuilding process occurred. This assessment assumed that there were no economic effects from further extreme weather events. ", " Turning to the broader picture, the information received since the December Board meeting had provided further evidence of the expected strong expansion of the resources sector. Another large LNG project in Queensland had received final investment approval in January and conditions in the resources sector remained positive. More broadly, overall business conditions in late 2010 were at around average levels, though there were significant differences across sectors. Non-residential construction remained weak. Business credit outstanding continued to contract, although other forms of external financing were growing. ", " Members discussed developments in the household sector, where the restraint in spending was continuing despite solid growth in household income. Data on retail spending in October and November were soft and liaison suggested that this had continued for most of December. A number of retailers reported that the days around Christmas were more positive, with some noting that this tone had continued into January. However, retailers continued to report that consumers were highly value-conscious. Surveys taken around the time of the Brisbane floods showed that consumer confidence had fallen in January to around its long-run average level. ", " The housing market remained steady, with nationwide measures of dwelling prices broadly flat since the June quarter 2010. Housing credit outstanding had continued to increase at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">½ per cent</span> per month, which was a little below growth in household income. Loan approvals, including for new construction, had increased in recent months. Building approvals data showed a solid recovery for apartments, reflecting particular strength in Victoria. ", " The labour market remained strong, with employment increasing by nearly 60,000 over November and December, and the unemployment rate falling to 5 per cent. Employment was estimated to have grown by 3.3 per cent over 2010. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, including job vacancies and hiring intentions, continued to point to solid employment growth and some further tightening in labour market conditions. ", " The CPI increased by 0.4 per cent in the December quarter, to be 2.7 per cent higher over the year. In underlying terms, inflation was a little under <span class=\"no-wrap\">½ per cent</span> in the quarter and around 2¼ per cent over the year. Most of the difference between the year-ended rates of headline and underlying inflation was due to the increase in tobacco excise in 2010, which was estimated to have increased the CPI by nearly 0.4 percentage points. ", " While food prices recorded a large increase in the December quarter, there were sizeable price declines for a large number of manufactured goods. It appeared that the subdued growth in household spending was contributing to a faster-than-usual pass-through of the exchange rate appreciation and the early 2010 tariff cuts. Overall, the past two CPI results suggested that the weakness in retail spending had led to a little more disinflation than had earlier been expected, with the year-ended underlying rate of inflation now clearly in the lower half of the target range. However, the latest reading on consumer inflation expectations – which was taken prior to the publication of the December quarter CPI – had shown an increase, probably reflecting reports that the floods would have a significant effect on food prices. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. The medium-term outlook for the domestic economy remained broadly unchanged from that discussed at Board meetings over most of 2010, although the recent floods would have a notable effect on the profile of GDP in the December, March and June quarters. Growth was expected to be lower in each of the December and March quarters, but then very strong in the June quarter as a recovery in coal production took place and the rebuilding effort gathered speed. For the four quarters to the end of 2011, GDP was forecast to increase by 4¼ per cent, which was higher than previously expected because the effect of the floods had been to lower output in the last quarter of 2010. Beyond 2011, the economy was still expected to grow at an above-trend pace, much as earlier forecast, reflecting the expected strong growth in mining investment and high commodity prices. Apart from the uncertainties stemming from the floods and the possibility of additional disruptions, members noted that other areas of uncertainty were the outlook for consumption and the exact timing of the pick-up in resources sector investment. ", " The near-term forecast for year-ended underlying inflation had been revised down a little since November, reflecting the base effects of the recent outcome. In terms of headline inflation, the floods were expected to add around ¼ per cent to CPI inflation in the March quarter – mainly through higher fruit and vegetable prices – with most of this being reversed in the following few quarters. The medium-term outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged. In underlying terms, year-ended inflation was forecast by the staff to be around 2½ per cent later in 2011, before picking up gradually to 3 per cent by late 2012. Year-ended headline CPI inflation was likely to remain above underlying inflation in the next few quarters. "], "Financial Markets": [" Sentiment in financial markets had generally improved over the past two months, with the notable exception of some of the smaller countries in the euro area, where concerns had increased about the sustainability of public finances. These concerns had reached a peak in early January, but had abated somewhat since then following extensive purchases of the debt of these countries by the European Central Bank (ECB), some successful debt issues and discussion of an expansion of the euro area support facility. ", " Parts of the banking system in Europe were also under scrutiny, with a significant amount of debt to be refinanced in 2011. There was evidence of tiering in the bank debt market, with the stronger banks able to issue relatively easily but the weaker banks required to pay considerably more for funding and, in some cases, being excluded from market funding. ", " In the major economies, bond yields had risen significantly in the past couple of months to their highest level in a year, though they remained low overall. The rise in yields reflected the generally more favourable economic data, notably in the United States. Members noted that the more modest rise in bond yields in Australia, reflecting the lower-than-expected inflation data for 2010 and concerns over the effect of the recent floods, had led to a contraction in the spread to US bond yields. ", " Market expectations of monetary policy were for tightening by the ECB and the Bank of England around mid 2011. This was earlier than previously expected, partly because of a less benign inflation outlook, particularly in the United Kingdom. No change was expected for the federal funds rate in the United States this year. The People's Bank of China raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points late in December and had also increased the reserve ratios of banks twice over the past two months. Monetary policy had been tightened in several other economies, notably some emerging market economies in Asia, reflecting concerns about inflation. ", " Emerging market bonds had not been much affected by the European sovereign debt concerns; the spreads between yields on emerging market US dollar-denominated sovereign debt and US Treasuries had been largely unchanged in recent months, after declining since mid 2010. Corporate bond spreads in the United States also had continued to decline to around the levels prevailing prior to the Greek crisis in May 2010, and corporate bond issuance remained strong. ", " The generally better-than-expected data for the global economy and renewed risk appetite had provided a boost to most equity markets in the past two months. However, performance among global equity markets during 2010 as a whole was mixed. The United States and emerging Asian economies had recorded a strong year, but there was a large fall in equity prices in China as monetary policy was tightened during the year. The euro area, Japan and Australia recorded little change in equity prices overall in 2010. In Australia, a solid rise in resource stocks over 2010 was offset by falls in financial and other stocks. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the concerns about Europe saw the euro fluctuate in a wide range against the US dollar, but in net terms it had appreciated over the past two months. The yen had also appreciated against the US dollar, to be near its highs, as had several emerging market currencies. This had prompted the imposition of further capital controls and continued foreign exchange intervention by authorities in some economies. The renminbi had appreciated slightly against the US dollar but had depreciated on a trade-weighted basis. The Australian dollar reached a new post-float high against the US dollar at the end of December. ", " Turning to a discussion on bank funding in Australia, members noted that there had been a further increase in banks’ share of funding sourced from deposits, and banks had continued to increase the term of their debt funding. The major banks had undertaken additional issuance in both local and offshore debt markets. Some of the government-guaranteed debt that was due to mature within a year had been repurchased as, for that maturity, unguaranteed funding had become cheaper. Overall, the banks remained well advanced on their funding plans. ", " Members noted further signs of improvement in the domestic securitisation market, with issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities in December taking total issuance for 2010 to just under $20 billion, around  40 per cent higher than the previous year. The market had required less support from the Australian Office of Financial Management than in 2009. Kangaroo bond issuance (issuance by offshore entities in Australian dollars) was particularly strong in January, in part reflecting the relative cheapness of swapping the Australian dollars raised into foreign currency. Corporate bond issuance in Australian had also been strong, particularly offshore. ", " Market pricing indicated that no change in the cash rate was expected at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Overall, members noted that the information on the global economy since the previous meeting had been positive for both the advanced and emerging economies. Strong growth in the latter group was putting significant upward pressure on commodity prices. The central forecast was for global economic growth to continue to be modestly above trend over the next couple of years, though there were both upside and downside risks. ", " Members also noted that the developments in commodity markets and in Australia's major trading partners in Asia had prompted an upward revision to the forecasts for the terms of trade, and suggested increased confidence in the overall outlook of strong growth in investment and incomes in Australia over the next few years. At the same time, however, the evident caution in household spending would, if it persisted, reduce the pressure on prices that might normally be expected in an economy with very strong terms of trade and limited spare capacity. ", " While the recent floods would have significant short-term effects on output and prices, members considered that the focus of monetary policy should remain on the medium-term outlook for economic activity and inflation. There had been significant damage to crops and physical capital in particular regions, but the information available to date suggested that the medium-term prospects for the economy were largely the same as they had been prior to the floods. ", " The Board had steadily removed the monetary stimulus that was put in place during the global crisis and had moved to a mildly restrictive monetary policy stance late in 2010. Given the medium-term outlook for the economy, and the limited amount of spare capacity that existed, members judged that this slightly restrictive policy stance remained appropriate. The continuation of subdued growth in consumer spending and the lower-than-expected inflation outcomes provided additional time for the Board to assess at future meetings the evolving balance of risks to both output and inflation.

Banking systems in the major countries had generally recovered further over the past six months as macroeconomic conditions improved and balance sheets continued to strengthen. Banks in parts of Europe remained under strain, however, with their recovery undermined by weak economic growth, fiscal strains and exposures to troubled property sectors. The Australian financial system had continued to perform significantly better than most others in the developed world, consistent with high balance-sheet quality and the relatively strong domestic economy. ", " Large banks in the major developed countries had continued to be profitable, although profit levels and returns on equity remained lower than prior to the crisis. A further reduction in provisions for bad loans had provided significant support for profits in recent periods, offsetting a moderation in trading income from the elevated levels seen in 2009. ", " Nevertheless, provisions and loan-loss reserves remained well above historical averages across all major banking systems as banks continued to deal with a large amount of troubled property-related exposures. Funding also remained a point of vulnerability for many banks as they sought to improve their funding structures and cope with the need to refinance government-guaranteed debt over the next few years. ", " In Australia, profits and returns on equity had recovered to near pre-crisis levels for the largest banks as bad debt expenses declined, with contributions also coming from growth in net interest income as well as insurance and funds management activities. Overall, non-performing asset levels – mainly reflecting troubled commercial property exposures – had stabilised over the past year; while flooding and other recent natural disasters would reduce short-term profits in some parts of the financial sector, the overall impact was expected to be limited. ", " Capital and liquidity positions of Australian banks had been bolstered further, and the banks were well placed to meet the more stringent Basel III requirements to be phased in over the next several years. One factor contributing to stronger liquidity positions was the slower rate of credit growth, which, in combination with faster deposit growth, had continued to ease wholesale funding pressures on banks. Reliance on short-term wholesale debt, in particular, had fallen from around a third of total bank funding in 2007 to around a fifth at present. ", " The household and business sectors in Australia did not appear to be under financial stress, though both continued to show more caution in their borrowing behaviour, as evidenced in slower rates of credit growth over the past couple of years. Members saw this as a welcome development, particularly as household debt remained at a historically high level and debt-servicing requirements had recently increased with the rise in interest rates. Members also noted that some sectors (for example, small property developers) continued to experience difficulty in accessing funds. ", " Members were briefed on recent international work on regulatory reform to strengthen financial systems, including the identification of systemically important financial institutions. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Information becoming available on the international economy over the past month had been broadly in line with developments in previous months. The data suggested that the world economy was continuing to grow at an above-trend rate, though the pace of growth remained uneven across economies. Most of Asia continued to expand strongly and the US economy was strengthening. There had also been a marked increase in international trade over recent months, particularly in Asia, and measures of business sentiment had improved further in a number of countries. ", " The continued improvement in the world economy had put upward pressure on commodity prices. While prices of rural and most mineral commodities had been broadly unchanged over the previous month, the political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa had further boosted oil prices. Members noted that while there was little domestically sourced inflation in the advanced economies, owing to considerable excess capacity, the recent increases in commodity prices had resulted in a renewed focus on inflation risks globally. ", " Some of the usual data on activity in the Chinese economy were not available because of the Spring Festival. However, imports of iron ore had increased significantly in January. Chinese exports were also estimated to have grown strongly, with recent data indicating strength in shipments to the major advanced economies as well as to elsewhere in Asia. CPI inflation was running at nearly 5 per cent over the year to January. Until recently, the pick-up in Chinese inflation had been largely accounted for by higher food prices, but non-food inflation had risen to 2.6 per cent, its fastest year-ended pace since 2001. The rise in inflation had occurred across a range of goods and services. The People's Bank of China had increased interest rates again in early February, and reserve requirements on the banking system had also been raised again. Credit growth remained firm, although there was some evidence that the authorities' efforts to slow credit expansion were having an effect. ", " The GDP data for other economies in east Asia had confirmed that output expanded at a solid pace in the December quarter, after a broadly flat outcome in the previous quarter. The exception was Japan, where private consumption fell sharply, partly as a result of the expiration of subsidies for a range of consumer goods. The more recent data on industrial production and international trade suggested that momentum in the region, including in Japan, had picked up somewhat at the end of 2010 and in early 2011. ", " In the United States, business conditions had continued to strengthen. Business surveys suggested that the outlook for the labour market had improved significantly, though this was yet to be reflected in the payrolls data. Conditions in the household sector were more mixed. Measures of consumer sentiment had improved somewhat and consumer credit had risen in recent months after declining for more than two years. However, members observed that the housing market remained weak, with prices declining over recent months. ", " The euro area had continued to grow at a moderate pace in the December quarter, although there remained large differences in the pace of growth across member states. Conditions had been strongest in France and Germany, with business confidence in Germany around the highest level in over 20 years. Output had contracted in some of the smaller economies, including Greece, where GDP was 6½ per cent lower over the year. Headline inflation in the euro area had risen to 2.3 per cent over the year to January, and the European Central Bank expected that rising energy and commodity prices would keep inflation above the 2 per cent target for much of 2011. Inflation in the United Kingdom was expected to increase to above 4 per cent in the near term and to remain above target until 2012. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The effect of the floods on the economy was becoming evident in the regular flow of data. Coal shipments from Queensland ports had declined sharply in January, consistent with the staff's earlier expectations. The staff continued to expect that the floods could take around ½ percentage point off growth in each of the December and March quarters, though ongoing problems in de-watering coal mines meant that the downside risks for the March quarter appeared larger than at the time of the February meeting. While Cyclone Yasi had a large impact on agricultural production in north Queensland, the effect on aggregate production in the national economy was expected to be small. ", " Most business surveys showed a deterioration in current conditions in January, and there was a substantial reduction in hours worked in Queensland. However, business confidence in late January had bounced back after falling in the previous survey taken in early January. Housing loan approvals were estimated to have fallen significantly in January, partly reflecting delays in processing applications and the disruption to the Brisbane housing market. ", " Retail sales data had shown subdued spending in late 2010, including a small fall in real spending for the December quarter. Liaison with retailers had suggested some improvement in conditions in early 2011, with sales data for January released during the Board meeting showing moderate growth in the month. Consumer confidence had softened in early 2011 to be only modestly above average levels, although it was difficult to determine how much of this decline was due to the floods and the cyclone. While households' perceptions about their own financial position were a little below average, their perceptions about employment prospects and buying conditions for major durable goods were still above average. Members observed that one factor contributing to subdued household spending was the earlier significant fall in wealth, especially in equity holdings. ", " The caution in the household sector was also apparent in the housing market, where nationwide measures of dwelling prices had been broadly stable for some time and auction clearance rates were close to average levels. Housing credit continued to expand at a rate that was much slower than in earlier years and a little below recent growth in household disposable income. In contrast, business credit had continued to decline modestly in recent months, with repayment rates remaining quite high. ", " Members discussed the outlook for investment. Recent capital expenditure data suggested a small increase in business investment in the December quarter. Importantly, firms were planning a significant increase in investment in 2011/12, particularly in the resources sector, although the outlook for commercial building construction had also improved. In contrast, the capital expenditure survey suggested little growth in spending on plant and equipment outside the mining sector over the next year or so. Members observed that the forecast growth in the resources sector, especially for LNG, would take investment in that sector to a level that was unprecedented as a share in GDP. ", " There had been another solid rise in employment in January, with the unemployment rate remaining at 5 per cent. Forward-looking indicators of employment from surveys and liaison pointed to solid employment growth over the coming year. Wage growth had picked up over the second half of 2010, with the quarterly outcomes for the wage price index back at around their average rate for the 2005–2007 period. Wage outcomes had been stronger in the mining sector. ", " The staff's inflation forecasts had been reviewed to take account of the effect of Cyclone Yasi on fruit and vegetable prices, particularly banana prices. With around three-quarters of Australia's banana crop destroyed and imports not permitted, banana prices were rising significantly. While the effect was smaller than that following Cyclone Larry in 2006, it was expected to add just under ½ percentage point to CPI inflation, spread over the March and June quarters. As a result, headline inflation for the year to June 2011 was forecast to be 3 per cent, up from 2½ per cent before the cyclone. As banana prices would return to normal levels later in the year, year-ended headline inflation over much of 2012 could be expected to be a little lower than was the case previously. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion on financial markets by noting that markets had been relatively stable over the past month. Markets were becoming more confident that monetary policy tightening would occur in the euro area and the United Kingdom in coming months, following the publication of data showing higher inflation. On the other hand, markets still did not expect an increase in interest rates in the United States until the first part of next year. In Asia, monetary policy had been tightened in China and Indonesia over the past month, though policy settings in Asia generally remained accommodative. ", " There had been some rise in yields in global bond markets early in the month, reflecting more positive data on the global economy, but yields had fallen back as concerns about developments in the Middle East and North Africa intensified. Spreads between yields on bonds of the smaller euro area governments and German bonds were broadly unchanged over the past month, remaining at relatively high levels. Government bond yields in Australia had generally been more stable than in other markets. ", " Corporate bond spreads in the United States and the euro area had narrowed further over the past month, particularly on lower-rated debt, and corporate bond issuance globally had been strong since the beginning of the year. Issuance of covered bonds in Europe had been particularly strong. ", " Locally, there had been issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities without the support of the Australian Office of Financial Management and yields had been below those in recent deals; these were further signs of recovery in the securitisation market. Kangaroo bond issuance had also remained strong. ", " Equity markets globally had risen solidly over the past month before the political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa saw equity prices decline somewhat. Members noted that overall price/earnings ratios were generally at no more than average levels. This was also the case for the Australian market, where the recent reporting season had highlighted diverse outcomes; the mining companies and the banks had recorded strong results, while retailing companies had generally fallen short of expectations and/or downgraded earnings predictions. ", " Foreign exchange markets had been relatively stable over the past month, with little movement in the major currencies, including the renminbi, against the US dollar. The Australian dollar had moved in a fairly narrow range. There had been a significant decline in the NZ dollar following the Christchurch earthquake. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members considered that developments over the past month had not materially altered the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. The global economy was still recording solid growth, notwithstanding differences across the major regions. Upward pressure on commodity prices was continuing. Global financial conditions remained accommodative, though some key countries in Asia had been responding to higher inflation by tightening policy.     ", " Domestically, the recent extreme weather events were now being reflected in some measures of economic activity. The effects of Cyclone Yasi would also add to CPI inflation in the short run, but the effects were likely to be reversed later in the year. Members confirmed that the Board's approach would be to look through temporary effects caused by extreme weather events and to continue to set monetary policy based on the medium-term outlook for growth and inflation. Overall, the economy appeared to be growing at close to its trend rate and the outlook for inflation over the year ahead was consistent with the target. ", " Interest rates on loans were slightly above average, a level reached after the monetary policy decision taken in November 2010. Members judged that this mildly restrictive stance of policy continued to be appropriate. The Board therefore decided to leave the cash rate unchanged.

{"Date": ["Sydney – 7 August 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Wendy Craik AM, Philip Gaetjens, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Ellis Connolly (Deputy Head, Domestic Markets Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": ["Members commenced their discussion by noting that the global economy had continued to grow above trend. Indicators of global industrial production and trade had remained at relatively high levels, as had surveyed business conditions. Spare capacity had continued to be absorbed, especially in the major advanced economies. Headline inflation had moved a little higher since the beginning of the year, primarily as a result of higher oil prices. Core inflation had also increased in a few economies, including the United States, but had remained low elsewhere. ", " The Bank's forecast was for global growth to ease a little over the following few years, but to remain above trend. Members noted that, although this forecast was broadly unchanged from three months earlier, the risks to the international economic outlook had shifted. Although the direct effects of trade protectionism measures that had been implemented and further measures that had been proposed were expected to be small, the broader risk of adverse effects on investment decisions and confidence had increased. On the other hand, members observed that the large fiscal stimulus in the United States was occurring in a period of little spare capacity in the US economy. It was therefore possible that US growth and inflation could be stronger than expected. This could prompt a faster withdrawal of monetary stimulus than markets expected and lead to a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. This scenario implied stronger global growth than forecast and could be associated with a depreciation of the Australian dollar, both of which would support the Australian economy. ", " The near-term outlook for growth had remained positive for the United States and Japan. In the June quarter, the US economy had received a boost from recent tax cuts and a pick-up in export growth, while growth in Japan was expected to have picked up, partly reversing the weak outcome in the March quarter. Both economies were expected to continue growing at an above-trend pace over 2018 and 2019; survey data had indicated that investment growth was expected to remain strong and labour market conditions were expected to support consumption growth. By contrast, in the euro area there had been signs that consumption growth and investment intentions had moderated a little since the beginning of 2018, although GDP growth was still expected to remain above trend over the forecast period. Across the advanced economies, unemployment rates had trended lower and surveys had suggested that more firms were facing labour shortages. Wages growth had picked up noticeably over the preceding few years, although it remained relatively low compared with its historical levels. ", " In China, GDP growth had eased slightly relative to a year earlier and growth had been weaker than expected in a number of sectors, including infrastructure construction. Nonetheless, steel production and prices had been high, which had supported Australian exports of bulk commodities. The Chinese authorities had tightened some regulations to reduce the build-up of financial stability risks, but had also introduced targeted fiscal stimulus and eased monetary policy to counter slowing growth in some sectors of the economy. Elsewhere in east Asia, year-ended output growth had been steady in the first half of 2018. Export growth had remained high and domestic demand had been increasingly contributing to growth. Members noted that many economies in the region were vulnerable to an escalation in trade tensions, given their high trade exposures and integration with global supply chains. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by observing that the outlook had not changed materially over the preceding three months. Growth was forecast to strengthen to be a bit above 3 per cent over 2018 and 2019, before easing to a little above trend towards the end of 2020 as the ramp-up in liquefied natural gas (LNG) production came to an end. ", "Non-mining business investment was expected to continue to grow over the forecast period, but at a more moderate pace than over the previous year. While quite lumpy, non-residential building approvals had fallen in trend terms since their peak in mid 2017. However, members noted that there was still a reasonable pipeline of building construction work, which should support growth in the near term. Work yet to be done on private infrastructure investment had also increased. Growth in investment in machinery and equipment was forecast to pick up further, consistent with an ongoing economic expansion. Mining investment was still expected to trough in coming quarters, but beyond that was expected to increase moderately as companies invested to sustain production. ", "Public demand was expected to make a significant contribution to growth over the period to the end of 2020, based on information provided in the state and federal budgets. Further expansion of the National Disability Insurance Scheme was expected to support public consumption, while infrastructure projects were expected to support public investment spending. ", "Drought conditions, particularly in New South Wales and southern Queensland, had affected the timing of crop harvests and had led to an increase in slaughter rates. This was expected to have contributed to a rise in rural exports in the June quarter. Members noted that the probability of an El Niño event, which would typically be associated with low rainfall in eastern Australia, had increased over 2018, implying downside risks to the forecasts for farm output and exports. Resource export volumes were expected to have been higher in the June quarter and to contribute to growth over the subsequent year or so, as LNG production continued to ramp up. ", "Commodity prices were little changed over the previous month. Trade tensions had contributed to falls in oil and base metals prices. Coking coal prices had fallen, partly as a result of Australian supply coming back on line, while prices of iron ore had risen and thermal coal prices had remained at a high level. Many rural commodity prices had increased, partly because drought conditions had restricted the supply of some rural commodities from Australia and other countries. Over the previous year, the terms of trade had held up at a higher level than previously forecast, largely reflecting higher thermal coal prices than had been expected. The terms of trade were expected to remain around their current level for a few quarters or so before declining moderately over the medium term. ", "In established housing markets, prices in Sydney and Melbourne had declined further in July and across a broader range of properties. Housing prices had also declined in Perth, but had increased in Hobart and been relatively stable in Adelaide and Canberra. Rental vacancy rates had been little changed in Sydney and Brisbane, and had continued to fall in Melbourne, where strong population growth had continued to outpace additions to the rental stock. Rental vacancies had remained high in Perth, but were lower than the peak in the previous year. ", "Despite the easing of conditions in the established housing market, dwelling investment was expected to remain at a high level, but not to contribute to growth, over coming quarters. Residential building approvals had trended lower, which was consistent with information from liaison contacts that there had been a decline in off-the-plan sales of apartments. Nevertheless, a significant pipeline of work remained to be done, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Liaison contacts had continued to report that capacity constraints had been limiting the pace at which the pipeline could be worked through, particularly in Sydney. ", "Recent data on consumption showed that retail sales in the June quarter had been consistent with steady growth in consumption in year-ended terms. Liaison contacts had also reported that retail trading conditions had been stable. Overall growth in consumption in the June quarter was expected to have been supported by growth in labour income. Growth in household disposable income had picked up over the year to the March quarter, reflecting an increase in growth in average earnings per hour and hours worked. Members noted that these increases, in combination with the more recent increase in minimum wages, the announcement of future tax cuts and expectations of a further tightening in labour market conditions, had reduced some of the uncertainty around the outlook for consumption. ", "Employment had increased by 51,000 in July, and employment growth had been a little above average over the first six months of 2018, although it had slowed from the very strong rate over 2017. The unemployment rate had declined slightly in recent months, but had remained around 5½ per cent since mid 2017. Leading indicators suggested that employment could be expected to grow at an above-average pace in the second half of 2018. ", "Members noted that the unemployment rate forecast profile was unchanged from three months earlier. With the extension of the forecast period to the end of 2020, the unemployment rate was expected to reach around 5 per cent by the end of the forecast period. Based on historical relationships, members noted that the level of vacancies was consistent with the forecast for a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the second half of 2018. However, there continued to be uncertainty about the extent of spare capacity in the labour market and how quickly this would translate into higher wage and price inflation over the forecast period. It was possible that ongoing above-trend growth in output could see the unemployment rate fall faster than expected and wages growth pick up more strongly as a result. Alternatively, it was possible that the flow of new entrants to the labour force could be stronger than usual, such that unemployment would decline more slowly than expected and wage pressures would take longer to emerge. ", "Headline and underlying inflation had both been around ½ per cent in the June quarter, in line with earlier forecasts. In year-ended terms, headline inflation had picked up a little to 2.1 per cent, while underlying inflation had remained close to 2 per cent. Strong competitive pressures and low growth in wage costs had been placing downward pressure on retail prices for some time. In an environment of falling wholesale prices and heightened competition in the retail energy sector, energy providers had reduced some retail prices in the June quarter and there had also been an unusually small increase in private health insurance premiums. Rents, which are a large item in the CPI basket, had been flat in the June quarter and year-ended rent inflation had been at its lowest rate since the mid 1990s. By contrast, inflation in new dwelling costs had risen. ", "Members noted that inflation in the September quarter was likely to be lower than previously forecast because of new government measures, including changes to childcare subsidies and TAFE and car registration fees, as well as some recent reductions in utilities prices. The forecast profile for inflation had otherwise been unchanged. Taking these effects into account, headline and underlying inflation were expected to be around 1¾ per cent over 2018, and then increase to around 2¼ per cent in 2020, in line with previous forecasts. Members noted that there was some risk that the recent decline in wholesale electricity prices could have more persistent effects on utilities prices than had been factored into the forecasts. At the same time, members noted that these price declines would boost real household disposable income. "], "Financial Markets": ["Members were briefed on developments in Australian dollar short-term money markets. Interest rates in these markets had been rising sharply towards the end of recent quarters, and only part of the rise had subsequently been unwound following the end of each quarter. As a result, the level of interest rates in these markets had been higher than in 2017, despite market expectations for the path of the cash rate having changed little over this period. ", "Members discussed a range of factors that may help to explain these outcomes, noting that it was difficult to be definitive about the cause. Around the end of the March quarter, the rise and fall of Australian dollar money market rates had been associated with a similar pattern for US dollar money market spreads, but in the June quarter the movements had been specific to Australia. Members noted that banks had become less inclined to supply liquidity to money markets in light of regulatory developments, although this development had also been experienced in money markets in other countries. As a result, interest rates appeared to have become more responsive to changes in demand and supply than had been the case previously. In particular, portfolio reallocation had lowered demand for bank bills issued by major Australian banks, which had contributed to the increase in the bank bill swap rate. In foreign exchange swap markets, where structural changes in liquidity conditions had also been apparent, interest rates had increased as a result of stronger demand for Australian dollars, partly reflecting the conversion back to Australian dollars of increased offshore bond issuance by Australian banks. ", "Notwithstanding these developments, domestic funding conditions had remained generally accommodative. Members noted that funding costs for the major banks had risen a little in 2018 as a result of the increase in short-term money market rates, but had remained low relative to history, consistent with the low level of the cash rate. In particular, the higher money market rates had to date not been reflected in significant changes in retail deposit rates. Banks' net bond issuance had remained strong in 2018 and bond spreads had remained low. ", "Members noted that the average interest rate on outstanding variable-rate housing loans had declined by around 10 basis points since August 2017. Some smaller lenders had increased their standard variable interest rates more recently, although other lenders had reduced interest rates on some mortgage products. ", "Housing credit growth had continued to ease over the first half of 2018, driven by a decline in credit growth for investors. Members noted that this appeared to have been mainly due to softening demand from investors in an environment of declining housing prices in some markets, although it was likely that there had also been some reduction in the supply of credit associated with tighter lending standards. ", "Turning to developments in global financial markets, members noted that global financial conditions continued to support economic growth. Monetary policy in the major economies remained accommodative, although central banks were at different stages of their monetary policy cycles. ", "In the United States, the Federal Reserve had continued to indicate that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate were likely over the next couple of years. Market pricing implied that the next policy rate increase was expected in September, but, beyond that, market expectations for the federal funds rate remained below those implied by the median projection of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Bank of Canada and Bank of England had both raised their policy interest rates at their most recent meetings, as had been widely expected. Market pricing implied that the Bank of Canada would increase policy rates further over the coming year. The European Central Bank had indicated that negative policy rates were likely to remain in place until the latter half of 2019 and that it planned to end its net asset purchases by the end of 2018. At its July meeting, the Bank of Japan introduced forward guidance to the effect that its stimulatory policy settings will remain in place for an extended period. In an effort to help improve market functioning, the Bank of Japan had also announced a slightly wider trading range for 10-year government bond yields to meet its target of around 0 per cent. ", "Members noted that government bond yields in the major markets had risen moderately over the preceding month, but had generally remained low. In the United States, markets had continued to focus on the flattening of the US Treasury yield curve. Members noted that this flattening had been driven largely by rising short-end rates (consistent with increases in the federal funds rate) and a decline in the term premium for bonds, rather than by expectations for slower growth or lower inflation. ", "Equity prices had risen further in the advanced economies over the preceding month, supported by strong corporate earnings. US share prices had outperformed other markets over recent months, following particularly strong corporate earnings in the United States, share buybacks and merger and acquisition activity. Australian share prices, when compared on the basis of accumulation indices (which take account of dividend payments), had also outperformed other markets over recent months. By contrast, in China, equity prices had fallen sharply over recent months in response to slowing growth and rising international trade tensions. ", "Major advanced economy exchange rates had generally been stable since the previous meeting. This had followed a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar over the course of 2018. The Chinese renminbi had depreciated since May, in part reflecting the general appreciation of the US dollar, but international trade tensions, moderating growth and a targeted easing in monetary policy by the People's Bank of China were also likely to have contributed. ", "Conditions in some emerging financial markets had stabilised somewhat since the previous meeting. Earlier localised financial market stresses relating to country-specific concerns had eased in some markets in July, although concerns had remained in some others. Overall, most emerging markets had experienced capital outflows and a depreciation of their exchange rates relative to the US dollar in 2018. ", "The Australian dollar had been little changed against the US dollar since the previous meeting, but had appreciated slightly on a trade-weighted basis, reflecting the recent depreciation in the renminbi. The Australian dollar had remained within its trading range of the previous few years. ", "Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period. ", "Members concluded their review of developments in financial markets with a discussion of access to finance for small businesses. Members reviewed the issues raised by participants at the Bank's Small Business Finance Advisory Panel and two special roundtable events involving representatives from small business, lenders and the public sector. They noted that many small businesses looking to expand still found it challenging to access finance, particularly without providing real estate as security. Lenders had highlighted that they were keen to lend to small businesses, and that the higher cost of unsecured finance mainly owed to the associated risk. Members noted that there had been more funding available from private equity sources recently, but that the supply of venture capital remained small compared with some other markets. ", "Members discussed some initiatives suggested by market participants that could potentially improve access to finance for small businesses. Members were encouraged by the potential for comprehensive credit reporting and open banking to lower the cost of credit risk assessment for lenders. They also noted efforts to improve the financial capability of small businesses by encouraging better financial record-keeping. They observed that the reliance on real estate as collateral in small business lending could be reduced by making it easier to use other assets as security, such as machinery and equipment. Finally, members noted private sector initiatives in other jurisdictions designed to provide more equity funding for small businesses seeking to expand. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the global economic expansion had continued. This had contributed to higher commodity prices in 2018, which had increased upstream inflationary pressures globally and boosted Australia's terms of trade. A number of advanced economies were growing at above-trend rates and were experiencing increasingly tight labour market conditions. There had been further evidence of rising wage pressures in these economies. Although core inflation had remained below most central banks' targets, it had increased to be around the US Federal Reserve's target. Growth in the Chinese economy had slowed a little and the authorities had eased fiscal and monetary policy in a targeted way to support near-term growth, while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector. The direction of international trade policy in the United States continued to be a source of uncertainty for the global outlook. ", "Against this backdrop, global financial conditions had remained expansionary, although they were gradually becoming less so in some economies, most notably the United States where the Federal Reserve was expected to increase the federal funds rate further over 2018 and 2019. This had contributed to a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. Although the Australian dollar had depreciated a little against the US dollar, in trade-weighted terms it had remained within its trading range of the previous two years. ", "The forecasts for the Australian economy were largely unchanged. GDP growth was expected to be a little above 3 per cent over 2018 and 2019, supported by strong public demand, resource exports, further growth in non-mining business investment and steady consumption growth. Business conditions remained positive, while recent data on wages growth and expectations of a further tightening in labour market conditions had provided more comfort that household income growth would continue to increase gradually and support the outlook for consumption. Members were cognisant of the effect of drought conditions on the rural sector. ", "Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, including vacancy rates, continued to point to above-average growth in employment in the near term. The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually towards 5 per cent. Wages growth was expected to increase gradually as spare capacity in the labour market is absorbed over the forecast period. Year-ended inflation had been close to 2 per cent in the June quarter, which was in line with previous forecasts. Although inflation was expected to be temporarily lower in the September quarter, owing to falls in some administered prices, inflation was still expected to be around 2¼ per cent in 2020. ", "Housing prices had fallen moderately in Sydney and Melbourne, following significant growth over preceding years, while housing prices had been relatively stable in most other capital cities. Rent inflation had remained low. Housing credit growth had declined, mainly because investor demand had slowed noticeably. Lending standards were tighter than they had been a few years previously, partly reflecting the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's earlier supervisory measures to help contain the build-up of risk in household balance sheets. Some further tightening of lending standards by banks was possible, although competition for borrowers of high credit quality remained strong. ", "Based on the forecasts, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy would continue to support economic growth and allow further progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. In these circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate would more likely be an increase than a decrease. However, since progress on unemployment and inflation was likely to be gradual, they also agreed there was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress unfolds. ", "Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent."]}},
{"Date": ["Perth – 4 September 2018"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Wendy Craik AM, Philip Gaetjens, Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that GDP growth in most of Australia's major trading partners had remained above trend. Monetary policy settings had continued to be accommodative in most economies, although a few central banks had become less accommodative as spare capacity was absorbed and inflationary pressures had become more apparent. ", " Growth in global industrial production had been robust, particularly in the United States, euro area and smaller east Asian economies (that is, excluding Japan and China). Growth in global merchandise trade had eased to around its decade average. Growth in euro area exports, particularly to China, had declined since mid 2017, while export growth had remained strong in smaller east Asian economies. More generally, members observed that there were still significant tensions around global trade policy and that this represented a material risk to the outlook. The United States and China had increased bilateral tariffs further in late August, consistent with earlier announcements. On the other hand, the US and Mexican governments were close to finalising a new trade agreement. ", " In the advanced economies, spare capacity had continued to be absorbed. In the United States, the strong growth recorded in the June quarter seemed likely to have continued into the September quarter, supported by fiscal stimulus. Survey measures had pointed to further robust growth in investment. In the euro area, GDP growth had eased in most countries over the first half of 2018, but had remained above trend growth. The Japanese economy had expanded in the June quarter, following the small weather-related contraction in GDP in the March quarter. Consumption growth had picked up and continued to be supported by relatively strong growth in labour income. Tight labour market conditions had also been encouraging Japanese firms to invest in labour-saving technology. GDP growth had remained above trend in smaller east Asian economies; although business investment growth had slowed in a few economies, consumption growth in the region overall had remained strong. ", " Labour markets had continued to tighten in most advanced economies. In the United States, Canada and Sweden, wages growth had been increasing gradually and this had led to a gradual increase in core inflation. In the United Kingdom, the depreciation of the pound had also contributed significantly to inflationary pressures. However, core inflation had remained subdued in the euro area and Japan despite above-trend growth. In contrast, in India inflation had remained above the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target; in response, monetary policy had been tightened in both June and July. ", " In China, growth in economic activity had slowed in a number of sectors. Growth in retail sales had been declining and infrastructure investment had been particularly weak. Domestic production of consumer-oriented goods, including white goods and textiles, had declined over time, with members noting that some production had been moved from China to other economies. In contrast, production of steel and glass, which are used extensively in construction, had increased. ", " The Chinese authorities had responded to the slowing in growth with targeted fiscal stimulus, including the announcement of new rail infrastructure projects and directives to hasten progress on some current infrastructure projects. Growth in total social financing had also increased in recent months, consistent with the authorities' encouragement of bank lending to certain sectors. Demand for housing had remained strong; property sales had increased and there had been a broad-based pick-up in growth in housing prices. The authorities in some cities had responded by strengthening regulatory measures. ", " The strength in Chinese crude steel production had supported imports of high-quality iron ore and coking coal. In turn, this had supported benchmark steel and iron ore prices, which had remained in a relatively tight range since the end of March, although the premiums for higher-quality iron ore had increased. Members discussed the variation in iron ore prices, reflecting different iron content and different physical characteristics including impurity levels. They noted that proposed replacement mines in Western Australia were expected to contribute to a higher average quality of iron ore product, which would also support prices received for Australian iron ore. ", " Movements in commodity prices had been mixed since the previous meeting. Benchmark iron ore prices had declined a little after the Chinese authorities announced a new round of environmental restrictions. Coking coal prices had increased over the prior month, but had declined from high levels since the start of the year. Thermal coal prices had remained at a high level, supported by strong demand from Asian economies. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members began their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that conditions in Western Australia had improved after the decline resulting from the resource investment cycle. Survey-based reports of business conditions in Western Australia, which had previously been well below those reported for the rest of the country, had increased to be above historical averages, although still below the rest of Australia. Average hourly earnings in Western Australia were still around 10 per cent higher than average hourly earnings in the rest of the country, although the differential had narrowed in recent years. Population growth in Western Australia remained well below the national average, after earlier very rapid growth. Members noted that there continued to be net migration from Western Australia to other parts of the country. Conditions in Western Australian housing markets had been weak: dwelling investment and building approvals were stabilising at low levels, while housing prices and rents had continued to fall. ", " Members observed that the national accounts for the June quarter would be released the day after the meeting. Growth was expected to be above estimates of potential growth in year-ended terms. Members observed that data released since the previously published forecasts suggested there could be upward revisions to the recent history of GDP growth, which would boost measured year-ended growth. ", " Growth in household consumption was expected to have recovered in the June quarter; retail sales volumes pointed to a solid increase in consumption of goods. Retail sales data for July had been relatively weak, although online sales had continued to grow rapidly. ", " Dwelling investment was expected to have increased in the June quarter. Work done on both detached and higher-density dwellings had picked up, driven by increases in New South Wales (despite reports of capacity constraints) and Victoria; residential construction work done on new dwellings had continued to drift slightly lower in Western Australia and Queensland. Although residential building approvals had declined from their peak of a few years earlier, the pipeline of work to be done had remained around historically high levels in Sydney and Melbourne. Some sources of demand for new housing had eased somewhat. Notably, information from liaison with developers had indicated that off-the-plan sales of new apartments in the major east-coast cities had declined over the preceding year as a result of weaker demand from domestic investors and foreign buyers. ", " Established housing market conditions overall had continued to ease. Housing prices had been falling gradually in Sydney and Melbourne, and in recent months price declines had become more widespread across different suburbs and price segments. Although housing prices in Perth had also declined over recent months, prices in other capital cities had been little changed. Rent inflation had remained low. ", " Private business investment looked to have declined a little in the June quarter, based on partial indicators. Non-mining investment intentions for 2018/19 reported in the ABS Capital Expenditure survey had been revised higher, although firms still expected capital expenditure to be lower than in 2017/18. Mining investment was still expected to trough in late 2018 or early 2019, as the remaining large liquefied natural gas projects are completed. Business conditions more generally had remained well above average, according to a range of surveys, despite easing slightly since earlier in 2018. ", " Export volumes had increased strongly in the June quarter, led by rural exports. Drought conditions in some parts of Australia were expected to result in lower overall rural production and exports in the period following the June quarter, although members noted that a record crop was expected in Western Australia. The increased probability of an El Niño event suggested that the prospects for rain in drought-affected areas had fallen in the near term, which was likely to increase the magnitude of any fall in output from the farm sector. ", " Conditions in the Australian labour market had continued to improve. Consistent with above-trend growth in the economy, the unemployment rate had edged slightly lower over 2018, to be 5.3 per cent, which was the lowest rate since late 2012. Members observed that there had been a notable decline in youth unemployment rates in recent months. The level of employment had been little changed in July; growth in full-time employment had been offset by a decline in part-time employment. Leading indicators had suggested that employment growth would be slightly above average in the period ahead. In particular, job vacancies had increased to be at a record high as a share of the labour force. Members noted that labour market conditions had continued to vary across the country. Employment growth had been strong in New South Wales and Victoria and the unemployment rates in these states were around 5 per cent. The share of the population in employment had continued to be highest in Western Australia, despite the unemployment rate in that state increasing to around 6 per cent. ", " Wages growth had picked up slightly in the June quarter, with a quarterly increase of 0.6 per cent in the wage price index. In year-ended terms, wages growth had edged higher since late 2016 and this pick-up had been quite broadly based across industries, with the notable exception of the retail sector. Information from liaison had continued to point to a modest increase in private sector wages growth in coming quarters. Members noted that the effects of the recent increase in the minimum wage would boost wage outcomes in the September quarter. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion of developments in financial markets by observing that broadly accommodative financial conditions had continued to underpin economic growth globally, and that the low volatility in financial markets in advanced economies contrasted with ongoing financial fragility in a number of emerging market economies. ", " In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was expected to increase the federal funds rate by another 25 basis points in September as the Federal Reserve continued gradually to withdraw monetary stimulus. Although financial conditions in the United States had tightened a little over the prior year, they remained expansionary overall. Market pricing continued to suggest a slower expected pace of policy rate increases than the median projection of FOMC officials. Members noted that in recent years, actual policy changes had been more closely aligned with the FOMC's median projections than with market expectations. ", " The Bank of England had increased its policy rate in August but was not expected to increase it again for at least another year, while the Bank of Canada had increased its policy rate in July and further increases were expected before the end of 2018. In Japan and the euro area, monetary policy was expected to remain highly stimulatory for some time. In both Australia and New Zealand, where official interest rates had not declined to the same extent as in other advanced economies, adjustments to the stance of monetary policy were also seen by markets as likely to be some way off. ", " Members noted that over the prior month, bond yields had declined slightly in most major markets and in Australia, and had remained at generally low levels for both sovereign and corporate issuers. However, Japanese bond yields had increased slightly in response to the announcement by the Bank of Japan of a wider trading range for 10-year government bond yields. In Italy, ongoing concerns about the future stance of fiscal policy following the change in government in May had resulted in wider spreads of Italian debt over German Bunds. However, the extent of the widening in spreads had been smaller than had occurred during the European debt crisis earlier in the decade, and spillovers to other markets had been relatively muted. Members noted that the budget plans of the coalition government in Italy, due to be tabled before parliament in late September, would be likely to be an important focus of financial market participants. ", " Strength in earnings had continued to underpin corporate debt and equity markets in the advanced economies, notably the United States, where the boost to economic activity, sales and profits from the recent tax cuts had contributed to generally positive earnings results. Share buybacks in the United States also had been boosted by recent tax reforms, which encouraged the repatriation of offshore earnings by multinational enterprises. Australian equity prices had been little changed over the preceding month, but accumulation indices (which take account of dividend payments) had continued to increase and the profit reporting period had been relatively positive. Members noted that the sharp decline in Chinese equity prices since the start of the year had occurred in an environment of weaker-than-expected indicators of growth and implementation of measures to contain financial risks, as well as rising trade tensions with the United States. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had been little changed against the other major currencies over the preceding month, having appreciated by around 5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis since the start of the year. Along with other currencies, the Australian dollar had depreciated against the US dollar, and on a trade-weighted basis, but remained within the relatively narrow range of the preceding few years. ", " Members discussed developments in emerging markets, where capital outflows had continued over the previous month and exchange rates had depreciated, particularly in a few countries that had significant economic, financial and institutional vulnerabilities. In some markets, the authorities had responded to exchange rate depreciation by intervening directly in the foreign exchange market and/or by raising policy rates. In Turkey, rising political tensions with the United States, high inflation and the lack of credible policy responses had contributed to another sharp depreciation of the lira over the preceding month, which was around 40 per cent lower against the US dollar over the year. In Argentina, the peso had also depreciated sharply. The Argentine authorities had been in discussions with the International Monetary Fund to revise the terms of the current financial assistance package, with the potential to bring forward the disbursement of funds to support the exchange rate and shore up the government's financing needs. ", " Turning to financial market developments in Australia, members noted that interest rates on bank bills and other money market instruments had remained at a higher level compared with the average level of 2017, and that this had placed some upward pressure on banks' funding costs. Higher money market rates had led to a modest increase in overall funding costs, taking account of all sources of funding, including retail deposits, on which rates had remained low and been drifting down of late. Nonetheless, funding costs remained low relative to history, consistent with the low level of the cash rate. ", " By the time of the September meeting, lenders accounting for around 40 per cent of outstanding housing credit (including one major bank) had announced increases in mortgage lending rates in response to the increase in funding costs. Once they take effect, these increases would imply a small rise in the average outstanding variable housing loan rate, unwinding about half of the decline observed in the average housing loan rate over the preceding year. Members noted that there was evidence that banks had continued to compete strongly for new borrowers for housing, including by increasing discounts on published lending rates. For owner-occupiers, housing credit had been growing relatively strongly at around 7½ per cent annualised over the preceding six months, whereas growth in lending to investors had slowed noticeably. ", " Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the global economic expansion had continued at a solid pace. Although growth in the Chinese economy had slowed a little, the authorities had eased fiscal and monetary policy in a targeted way to support near-term growth, while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector. Global commodity prices had generally remained elevated, which had supported Australia's terms of trade in the first half of 2018, but ongoing uncertainty about trade policy had led to volatility in the prices of some commodities. More generally, the direction of international trade policy in the United States continued to be a source of uncertainty for the outlook for the world economy. ", " Most advanced economies were growing at above-trend rates and were experiencing increasingly tight labour market conditions as well as rising wage pressures. Although core inflation had remained subdued in the euro area and Japan, it had picked up to around central bank targets in the United States and a number of smaller advanced economies. Against this backdrop, a few central banks, including the Federal Reserve, were expected to continue gradually reducing the degree of monetary policy accommodation. This had been reflected in financial market pricing, most notably a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. This appreciation had raised risks for some economies, particularly the more fragile emerging market economies, but the modest depreciation of the Australian dollar was helpful for domestic economic growth. ", " Recent data had suggested that domestic growth had been above potential over the year to the June quarter, supported by strong public demand, resource exports, non-mining business investment and steady consumption growth. Business conditions remained positive and recent data on labour market outcomes had been positive. The unemployment rate had declined to 5.3 per cent in July, which was its lowest rate since the peak of the mining investment boom in 2012. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, including vacancy rates and survey measures of employment intentions, continued to point to above-average growth in employment in the near term. The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually towards 5 per cent. Wages growth was expected to increase gradually as spare capacity in the labour market is absorbed. More generally, recent data had not changed members' assessment that GDP growth was likely to remain above potential throughout the forecast period and inflation was likely to increase over time. However, members recognised that there continued to be risks associated with uncertainties from abroad and low wages growth. ", " National housing prices had fallen moderately. In Sydney and Melbourne, price declines had followed significant growth over preceding years. Housing credit growth overall had declined, mainly because investor demand had slowed noticeably. Lending standards were tighter than they had been a few years previously, partly reflecting APRA's earlier supervisory measures to help contain the build-up of risk in household balance sheets. Some further tightening of lending standards by banks was possible, although competition for borrowers of high credit quality remained strong. ", " Based on the forecasts and associated risks, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy would continue to support economic growth and allow for further progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. In these circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate would more likely be an increase than a decrease. However, since progress on unemployment and inflation was likely to be gradual, they also agreed there was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress unfolds. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

"], "International Economic Conditions": [" The major international news since the previous Board meeting had been the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power problems in Japan. Beyond the human cost, the earthquake had destroyed part of the capital stock, disrupted production and significantly impaired electricity generation in a wide area, including Tokyo. While there were very few economic data available for Japan for March, it was clear that activity would be sharply lower in the near term, with rebuilding subsequently expected to boost growth. Members were briefed on possible scenarios for electricity supply and demand in coming months, which would be an important determinant of the likely contraction in economic activity. The extent to which concerns over nuclear contamination affected confidence and household spending would be another important factor. Overall, members judged that the effects on the Japanese economy were likely to be significantly larger than those of the Kobe earthquake in January 1995. ", " There would also be some effects on regional supply chains, though the effects on global activity were likely to be relatively limited. For Australia, Japan was the second most important export destination, accounting for nearly half of thermal coal exports and close to one-fifth of iron ore exports. In the very short term, it was likely there would be some disruption to exports of goods and services to Japan, though, beyond this, the rebuilding effort and a possible increase in use of non-nuclear forms of energy could provide a boost to Australian exports. ", " The broader flow of information on the global economy continued to be consistent with relatively strong growth and a build-up in inflationary pressures. In the immediate aftermath of the Japanese disaster, commodity prices had declined as uncertainty rose, though this decline had been reversed after the situation became a little clearer. Most commodity prices were at high levels, reflecting strong demand from emerging economies. The increase in commodity prices over the past year was flowing into higher rates of inflation in many countries. ", " Growth remained strong in China, though there were tentative signs that it had eased a little relative to late 2010. While the new five-year plan envisaged a modest slowing in nationwide GDP growth relative to the previous target – and a more significant slowing relative to actual growth over the past five years – members noted that individual provinces and regions were continuing to aim for rapid growth. The most recent data showed inflation continuing to run at nearly 5 per cent. While strongest for food, inflation rates for a range of items had picked up recently. Renminbi-denominated export prices had been increasing since late 2009, after an extended period when they had been flat or declining. ", " Output in most other countries in east Asia was also expanding solidly, with measures of capacity utilisation, including unemployment rates, returning to around their pre-crisis levels. With inflation rates in the region trending higher, the authorities were gradually removing monetary stimulus. Despite this, real interest rates generally remained quite low, with the authorities also relying on macro-prudential measures. ", " Members observed that the increase in global commodity prices was posing challenges for the advanced economies. The recent data for the United States and Europe suggested that a moderate recovery was continuing, though there remained a large amount of spare capacity and unemployment rates were high. While there was little evidence that domestically sourced inflationary pressures were building, headline inflation rates had risen owing to higher energy and food prices. In some countries, this had led to a pick-up in measures of inflation expectations, especially over the next year. The US housing market was still weak and higher oil prices looked to be reducing consumer confidence. In contrast, the data for the US labour market showed a gradual improvement outside of the public sector and the manufacturing sector appeared to be in a solid upswing. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" According to the national accounts, GDP had increased by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, to be 2.7 per cent higher over the year. This was in line with expectations at the time of the February meeting. The initial effects of the Queensland floods on economic activity had been evident in a fall in coal production in the December quarter. Members observed that the national accounts had shown significant differences in the pace of growth across sectors and regions. For example, growth in output in the retailing and manufacturing sectors had been relatively soft over the preceding year, whereas growth in a range of service sectors had been quite strong. ", " The extreme weather events across Queensland and elsewhere were complicating the interpretation of the economic data for the March quarter. While domestic demand appeared to be expanding at a solid pace, production in the quarter had been significantly affected by the natural disasters. In particular, liaison with the Queensland coal industry suggested that delays in removing water from the coal mines were leading to a slower recovery in coal production than had previously been expected. ", " The household sector continued to exhibit restraint in spending, with the household net saving ratio remaining around 10 per cent in the December quarter. Retail spending had recorded modest increases in the first two months of 2011, consistent with the staff's liaison with retailers. Consumer sentiment had declined recently to be only modestly above long-run average levels. While there was considerable optimism among households about prospects for the broader economy, members noted that consumers were less positive about their own finances. Conditions in the housing market remained subdued, with housing prices down slightly over the first two months of the year and auction clearance rates a little below average. Consistent with this, growth in household credit had remained well below the average rate of recent years, and housing loan approvals had fallen in January and February. Residential building approvals had weakened in early 2011, with the fall concentrated in apartments, especially in Victoria, where there had been very strong growth in 2010. ", " The recent business indicators showed a somewhat mixed picture. Survey-based measures of current conditions were mostly around average, while forward-looking measures had picked up to be above average. Imports of capital goods had been trending up and business credit had risen in February, the first increase in nine months. Overall borrowing conditions remained tight, though liaison with larger businesses indicated that there had been some improvement in the availability of finance. ", " A strong pick-up in business investment remained the central element in the medium-term outlook. Members again discussed the very strong outlook for investment in the resources sector, particularly in gas. Members noted that a major challenge was whether the economy could accommodate the expected high rate of investment without undue pressure on costs. Outside the resources sector, growth in investment was expected to be relatively modest. The appreciation of the exchange rate was weighing on trade-exposed sectors such as tourism and manufacturing, and subdued consumer spending was affecting prospects for investment in the retail sector. In contrast, with office vacancy rates in the two largest cities projected to fall to quite low levels, a pick-up in commercial property construction was expected over the next couple of years from the current low levels. ", " Employment growth was estimated to have slowed from the rapid pace seen in the second half of 2010. The unemployment rate had, however, held steady at around 5 per cent, suggesting that the reported slowing in employment could be overstated. Forward-looking indicators pointed to a continuation of employment growth over the months ahead, but at a more moderate pace than seen last year. ", " There had been little new data on wages and inflation over the past month. Liaison with firms suggested that wage growth was increasing in mining-related industries and some skilled occupations, though pressures in the labour market had not become widespread. Recent data suggested that higher fruit, vegetable and petrol prices would significantly boost the CPI for the March quarter. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that financial markets had been significantly more volatile over the past month in the wake of developments in Japan, Libya and Europe. Share markets fell sharply following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Subsequently, most share markets recovered, with the exception of the Japanese market, which remained below its level prior to the earthquake. ", " There had also been considerable volatility in exchange rates. Following the earthquake, the yen appreciated on expectations of repatriation of offshore funds by Japanese insurers and pension funds. Similar expectations saw the Australian dollar decline by more than most other currencies given the relatively large share of Japanese funds invested in Australia. On 17 March, a large upward spike in the yen saw it rise to a historic high in nominal (though not real effective) terms. This prompted co-ordinated intervention by the G7 the following day, the first such intervention in more than 10 years. By and large, the repatriation flows did not materialise. The yen had subsequently depreciated again and the Australian dollar had recovered to new post-float highs. ", " Members noted that developments in Europe had again become the focus of market attention, after a period when other issues had been important. The Irish Government remained in negotiations with European authorities on the terms of its support package, while there was heightened speculation that Portugal would also need a support package. There were growing signs of opposition to these packages in those countries that would be required to provide the funding. ", " The strong issuance in global bond markets continued in March, notwithstanding the volatility in some markets. Locally, there were further signs of recovery in the residential mortgage-backed securities market, with a number of large bond issues taking place without support from the Australian Office of Financial Management. There had also been strong demand for corporate bond issuance. The continuation of strong deposit growth and limited asset growth had lessened the need for bond issuance by the domestic banking sector, which had generally just covered maturities. ", " A number of central banks in the Asian region had continued to tighten monetary policy, though conditions remained accommodative. The market expected the European Central Bank (ECB) to raise its policy rate at the next meeting, the first tightening by the ECB since the onset of the financial crisis, and the Bank of England was expected to follow a few months later. The Federal Reserve, however, was not expected by the market to begin tightening until next year. Locally, market pricing indicated that no change in policy was expected in the near future. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members observed that recent events in Japan had increased the uncertainty around the near-term global outlook. There were also other continuing uncertainties, including the sovereign debt problems in Europe and the impact of higher oil prices on the large advanced economies where recoveries were less well established. In Asia, the challenges appeared to be in the direction of coping with strong growth and rising inflation. While it remained to be seen how these uncertainties would ultimately be resolved, the most likely outlook was that growth in the world economy in the period ahead would be around trend pace, or a little higher, and that the price of Australia's main exports would remain at high levels for some time to come. ", " Domestically, employment growth had slowed somewhat from the rapid rate seen in 2010, though the outlook for the labour market remained positive. It appeared that domestic demand was growing at a solid pace and was likely to continue to do so in the medium term, with stronger-than-average growth in business investment offsetting weaker-than-average growth in consumption and dwelling investment. While this combination was leading to considerable variation in conditions across sectors, it was broadly in line with the forecasts that the staff had had for some time. In the short term, however, the economic data were likely to be significantly affected by the earlier floods and cyclone. Headline inflation was likely to be quite high in the March quarter, while GDP would be held down, to a greater extent than earlier assumed, by the lost coal production and the delays in resuming mining operations. In reaching its decision, the Board would look through these fluctuations. ", " Reflecting the Board's earlier decisions and developments in financial markets, interest rates on both housing and business loans were a little above average levels. Given the outlook for the economy, and in particular the high level of the terms of trade and the prospective further large increase in investment, members considered that this stance remained appropriate so as to ensure that the medium-term inflation outlook remained consistent with the target. Members therefore did not see a case to change the cash rate. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.75 per cent. "]}},

Growth in China and the rest of emerging Asia had remained strong, which was continuing to underpin high commodity prices. The rise in food and fuel prices over the past year was pushing up headline inflation rates globally, prompting a gradual tightening in monetary policy in a number of economies. The IMF was still forecasting above-trend growth for the global economy, albeit with significant differences between the rates of growth expected for the advanced and emerging economies. ", " It remained difficult to gauge the overall economic effects of the disasters in Japan, although it had become clear that they would be more serious than was the case following the Kobe earthquake in 1995. While black-outs were no longer occurring, electricity supply would be constrained during the summer months, and it was still uncertain to what extent Japanese consumer behaviour would be affected by the nuclear power problems. The economic data that were available for the month of March showed major declines: industrial production fell by 15 per cent, retail trade and exports both declined by 8 per cent, and survey-based measures of business conditions and consumer confidence declined sharply. There were also reports that supply-chain problems were constraining production in other parts of the world, particularly in the automobile industry. ", " In contrast, the pace of growth in China had remained robust. GDP grew by around 2 per cent in the March quarter and most of the timely indicators of activity – including industrial production, exports and retail sales – suggested that the economy was continuing to grow strongly. Members discussed the further rise in Chinese inflation. Food price inflation remained elevated and there were increasing signs that higher raw material prices were feeding through into higher prices for a range of consumer goods. In response, the authorities had continued with a range of measures to contain price increases for particular goods and services, including the announcement by the People's Bank of China of further increases in interest rates and reserve requirements. ", " Demand was also growing strongly in other east Asian economies and in India. March quarter GDP data for Korea, Singapore and Taiwan had been quite strong. Headline and core inflation rates had risen across the region. ", " The recovery was continuing in the United States, although March quarter GDP growth had been somewhat below expectations. Consumption growth had slowed a little, which was likely in part to reflect the effect of the significant increase in gasoline prices on household budgets. Consumer confidence remained low and the housing market was still very weak. In contrast, measures of business conditions were positive. Information on the labour market was mixed: while most of the recent data, including the payrolls reports, had suggested that the improvement was continuing, initial jobless claims had increased recently. Members observed that the need to put fiscal policy on a more sustainable footing continued to affect confidence in the outlook for the US economy. ", " While overall economic conditions in Europe had mostly firmed, there continued to be a wide variation in performance within the region. Higher commodity prices had led to a noticeable pick-up in headline inflation rates in the euro area, as well as in the United States. Recent data on activity in the United Kingdom had remained relatively soft. ", " Oil prices had increased further since the April meeting, with the price of Tapis crude rising to around US$130 per barrel. The prices of Australia's bulk commodity exports had also risen, with annual benchmark contract prices for thermal coal exports settling at around US$130 per tonne, a little above what had been expected, and spot iron ore prices had also moved higher. In contrast, the prices of some food items had declined over the past month, as global supply concerns had eased, although prices remained high. ", " Members discussed the implications of recent developments in commodity prices for global inflation. While the depreciation of the US dollar was one factor behind the increases, prices had also risen significantly in terms of other currencies, largely reflecting strong growth in demand, especially from the emerging economies. Members noted that monetary policy remained accommodative in most countries, which was adding to pressure on commodity markets. In this environment, global inflation risks appeared to have moved to the upside. In some countries, higher commodity prices were also acting as a negative supply shock and reducing real incomes at a time when activity remained quite subdued. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The main economic news over the preceding month had been the release of the CPI, which increased by 1.6 per cent in the March quarter, with the year-ended rate of inflation rising to 3.3 per cent. The March quarter outcome had been boosted by large price rises for a few items. There had been a 15 per cent increase in fruit and vegetable prices, a consequence of the extreme weather conditions earlier in the year. More recent data from wholesale markets suggested that the prices of some fruit and vegetables had already fallen back, although banana prices were expected to contribute further to inflation in the June quarter. Fuel prices rose by nearly 9 per cent in the quarter, electricity prices increased by 5 per cent, and there were large seasonal increases in the prices of health and education services. Members noted that some further large increases in electricity prices were scheduled. Partially offsetting the rises in these various items, the appreciation of the exchange rate had contributed to falls in the prices of many imported retail goods. The price indices for clothing and footwear, furniture, household appliances and audio-visual equipment had all fallen over the year to the March quarter. ", " The underlying measures of inflation – at 0.7–0.9 per cent in the quarter – were a little higher than expected, although looking through the volatility in the quarterly numbers, the outcomes over the past six months had been in line with expectations last November. On a year-ended basis, underlying inflation had remained at 2¼ per cent, down from a peak of a little over 4½ per cent in 2008. ", " There had been only a limited amount of data on domestic activity released since the previous Board meeting, but this had had a slightly more positive tone than earlier in the year when natural disasters dominated the news. Business conditions, as measured by the NAB survey, recorded a significant rise in March to above-average levels, and business credit rose by 1 per cent in the month, the strongest outcome since late 2008. While there had been no new official data on retail sales since the previous meeting, the staff's liaison suggested modest growth in volumes over the past month or so. ", " The unemployment rate had declined to 4.9 per cent in March, its lowest level in more than two years. Employment was estimated to have risen solidly in the month after no net growth over the previous three months. The participation rate remained close to its record high and average hours were gradually picking up. Forward-looking indicators continued to point to fairly solid labour demand in the period ahead. ", " Conditions in the housing market remained subdued, with prices in most cities either flat or down over the past few months. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had been at below-average levels in recent months. Members observed that growth in housing credit had slowed in recent months, while building approvals and home loan approvals had also softened in 2011. While this partly reflected the effect of the Queensland floods, conditions had softened in most other states as well in the wake of the increase in housing loan interest rates in November. ", " In the resources sector, liaison continued to point to a larger contraction in coal production in the March quarter than had earlier been expected, reflecting problems in removing water from flooded mines. As a result, there was a high likelihood that GDP had declined in the March quarter. In contrast, domestic demand was likely to have grown solidly in the quarter. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. Notwithstanding the divergences between regions, the world economy was expected to grow at a modestly above-trend pace over the next few years. Australia's terms of trade were expected to rise by around 10 per cent over the March and June quarters, to be more than double their average level in the 1990s, before falling back a little over the forecast period as additional global supply of resources came on line. ", " As had been the practice over the past couple of years, the domestic forecasts were based on the assumption that the cash rate moved in line with expectations implied by market pricing. The medium-term outlook for the domestic economy remained similar to that discussed over the past year or so, although the growth forecasts had been lowered a little owing to the further appreciation of the exchange rate and its effect on trade-exposed sectors. Nonetheless, for most of the forecast period, growth was expected to be at, or above, trend, underpinned by a boom in investment and the income boost from the very high level of the terms of trade. As a result, the unemployment rate was expected to continue to decline gradually. In the short term, the quarterly profile for GDP would be significantly affected by the floods, with a significant bounce-back in coal production expected in the June and September quarters. Members also noted the prospect of significant fiscal consolidation over the next couple of years. ", " The moderation in inflation looked to have run its course. Given the March quarter outcome, the forecast for underlying inflation over 2011 had been lifted a little to around 3 per cent. For 2012, underlying inflation was expected to remain around that level, with the gradual pass-through of the exchange rate appreciation providing a partial offset to rising inflation pressures for non-traded items. By the end of the forecast period, underlying inflation was expected to be above 3 per cent. Headline inflation was forecast to remain above underlying inflation for the remainder of 2011, largely owing to higher fruit and vegetable prices. It was then expected to be below underlying inflation for much of 2012, as banana prices returned to more normal levels. ", " In terms of risks, members noted the challenges for policy-makers internationally in dealing with the pick-up in global inflationary pressures. Sovereign debt concerns, both in Europe and the United States, remained an additional risk for the global economy. Domestically, one area of uncertainty was the behaviour of the household sector and whether the recent cautiousness of households would continue. Another uncertainty concerned the tightening of the labour market and whether a pick-up in wages in the resources sector would spill over into significant pressure on wages elsewhere in the economy. Members observed that the behaviour of households and the labour market would be important determinants of the outcome for inflation over the next few years. In addition, it would be important that inflation expectations remained anchored and that economic policies were conducive to productivity growth. "], "Financial Markets": [" Concerns about sovereign creditworthiness had come to the fore again in financial markets, with Portugal having sought assistance from the European Union and the IMF. While any assistance package was likely to be similar in size and terms to those for Greece and Ireland, members noted that it could be delayed because of growing opposition to such rescue packages in other parts of Europe. Increased speculation about a restructuring of Greek debt late in April saw spreads on peripheral debt widen further to new highs. However, sovereign debt markets had not been affected when Standard &amp; Poor's placed the credit rating of the US Government on negative outlook, given that markets were already well aware of the state of the US Government's fiscal position. ", " Members observed that the depreciation of the US dollar had accelerated in recent weeks, falling to a record low on a trade-weighted basis. In part, this reflected the fact that US monetary policy was still being eased, with the Fed continuing to buy US government debt, whereas monetary policy had been tightened in a number of other countries. The euro appreciated to its highest level in nearly 18 months after the European Central Bank raised its policy rate from the low it had been at for two years. Many emerging market currencies had also risen to historically high levels against the US dollar as the authorities in those economies tightened monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures. The renminbi had appreciated against the US dollar by less than most other currencies, resulting in a decline in China's trade-weighted index. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated to a fresh post-float high against the US dollar. On a trade-weighted basis, the currency was at its highest level since 1985 and had appreciated by 6 per cent since the start of the year. While this partly reflected the general depreciation of the US dollar, the Australian dollar had tended to rise more than most other currencies. An important influence had been purchases by other central banks seeking to invest their official reserve assets. ", " Global equity markets had a quieter month after the volatility caused by the Japanese earthquake in March. US share prices had risen in response to corporate earnings reports that were generally better than expected, though share prices for several large US banks declined, mainly because the composition of their earnings was not viewed as favourably by the market. Members noted that the local share market had tended to underperform other markets, in part reflecting the effect of the exchange rate appreciation. ", " There had been sizeable issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the local securitisation market during April from a range of financial institutions. As in March, these issues required relatively little support from the Australian Office of Financial Management and were generally at narrower spreads, reflecting the extent of demand. Corporate bond issuance had also been strong, both onshore and offshore, with a wide range of companies borrowing at relatively narrow spreads. ", " Market expectations of monetary policy tightening in Australia had shifted higher after the release of the CPI, though markets did not expect a rise in interest rates at the current meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that the data becoming available for Australia were being significantly affected by earlier floods and Cyclone Yasi. The inflation rate had been boosted by a large increase in fruit and vegetable prices, and it was quite likely that GDP would be shown as having contracted in the March quarter because of the disruption to production in the mining sector. As discussed at the previous meeting, members remained of the view that it was appropriate to look through the temporary effects on inflation and growth and to set policy based on the medium-term outlook. ", " Recent data confirmed above-trend growth in the world economy, which was boosting commodity prices. In turn, this was supporting real incomes in Australia and leading to very high levels of investment in the resources sector. The outlook for economic activity remained largely unchanged. While there were many uncertainties about the world economic outlook, the central scenario was for a continuation of above-trend growth. Growth in Australia was expected to be relatively strong over the next few years, with the unemployment rate moving lower. ", " The recent CPI outcome had been higher than expected, although this followed an unusually low figure in the preceding quarter. While underlying inflation was currently in the lower half of the target band, it looked to have troughed and was expected to increase, over time, from there. The recent appreciation of the exchange rate and a continuation of the relatively high saving ratio by households would help to contain some of the inflationary pressures coming from the resources boom. Nonetheless, the staff forecast was for underlying inflation to be in the top part of the target band over the next couple of years and, based on the interest rate path implicit in recent financial market pricing, above 3 per cent towards the end of the forecast period. ", " Members viewed the current mildly restrictive stance of monetary policy as remaining appropriate, with recent rises in the exchange rate likely to have further tightened conditions, particularly in some sectors of the economy. Members noted that the significant divergences between different sectors of the economy presented challenges for policy-making, but that monetary policy had to be set for the needs of the overall economy. In this respect, members judged that if economic conditions continued to evolve as expected, higher interest rates were likely to be required at some point if inflation was to remain consistent with the medium-term target. Members agreed to continue to assess carefully the evolving outlook for growth and inflation at future meetings.

In the United States, the increase in wages growth had been boosted by workers changing jobs, but recently workers had also been receiving higher wage increases without changing employers. Members observed that inflation in the major advanced economies had increased as a result of higher oil prices and wages growth. However, core inflation had remained low and little changed in some advanced economies, notably Japan and the euro area, but was close to target in others, including the United States. ", " Growth in China had moderated a little further in the September quarter, following the tightening of financial conditions in late 2017 and early 2018. Although activity in the Chinese services sector had been resilient, conditions had remained weak in the industrial sector and public investment had declined. In response, the Chinese authorities had implemented targeted monetary and fiscal policies to support growth, while maintaining their commitment to containing risks in the financial system. The adverse effect on the Chinese economy from higher tariffs was likely to have been partly offset by policy measures that had been introduced to support affected trading firms. The depreciation of the renminbi over 2018 had also provided support to the economy overall. Elsewhere in Asia, indicators suggested that growth had eased a little recently. The fact that this easing had been most pronounced in growth in exports and industrial production suggested it may have been affected by US–China trade tensions, given the integration of east Asian economies in global manufacturing supply chains. ", " Commodity prices, in particular those for bulk commodities, had held up by more than had been expected over the previous year. In part, this reflected a number of unforeseen disruptions to supply, particularly for coking coal. Members noted that, in addition, global steel demand had been stronger than anticipated. Oil prices had also risen, which had increased Australia's terms of trade. Although Australia is a net importer of oil, Australian exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and other oil-related products – the prices of which are linked to oil prices – are larger, following a sustained period of strong growth. Along with a higher starting point as a result of commodity prices having held up, the forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised higher for the next few years owing to a reassessment of the expected strength in global demand for commodities, particularly from China and India. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the recent run of economic data suggested that growth in the Australian economy had been higher over the year to the June quarter than earlier forecast, and above estimates of potential growth. Labour market conditions had remained strong and other available indicators pointed to further solid GDP growth in the September quarter. At the same time, inflation in the September quarter had slowed as expected, partly as a result of a large policy-induced decline in childcare prices. ", " GDP growth was expected to be around 3½ per cent on average over 2018 and 2019. Members noted that growth would be supported by accommodative monetary policy, above-trend growth in Australia's major trading partners and a stronger profile for the terms of trade. Year-ended GDP growth was expected to ease to around 3 per cent towards the end of 2020 because LNG exports were expected to reach capacity production levels by the end of 2019. ", " Consumption had continued to grow by around 3 per cent in year-ended terms, despite ongoing low growth in household income. Growth in retail sales had been volatile on a quarterly basis, although in year-ended terms growth had been fairly steady at a relatively modest rate. Conditions had continued to differ across states; retail sales had been relatively strong in Victoria but had declined in Western Australia. Members noted that the strong pace of growth in retail spending online in recent years could be one factor contributing to subdued conditions in retail rental markets. Year-ended growth in household consumption was expected to remain around 3 per cent over the following few years. Growth in household disposable income was forecast to increase to a similar rate. ", " Although residential building approvals had fallen in the September quarter and liaison indicated that pre-sales had become harder to obtain, the large pipeline of work yet to be done was expected to support dwelling investment at a high level over the following year or two. Members noted that population growth was expected to remain fairly strong over the following few years, and that this would provide some support to housing demand. However, there had been reports that bank financing of large development projects had become more difficult, particularly in areas where there had already been substantial development. ", " Members noted that established housing prices had fallen further in Sydney and Melbourne. After rising by more than apartment prices in preceding years, house prices had fallen by more than apartment prices since 2017. Conditions in the established housing market had been stable in most other cities, although housing prices had declined a little further in Perth in recent months. Rental vacancies had increased in Sydney, consistent with the additions to the stock of housing over the past year, and rent inflation had remained low across the country. ", " Members observed that business investment had been stronger than forecast a year earlier. The recent strength in non-mining business investment was expected to continue and to make a significant contribution to output growth over the forecast period. Private non-residential construction was expected to be supported by above-average business conditions and the significant pipeline of non-residential construction work that had been approved. Expenditure on machinery and equipment was also expected to rise over the forecast period. Members noted that mining investment had not fallen by as much as expected over the previous year, largely reflecting additional spending on the remaining LNG projects under construction. The trough in mining investment was still expected to occur in late 2018 or early 2019. ", " Exports had continued to make a significant contribution to growth in output over the preceding year. Resource exports had increased further, mainly because production of LNG had continued to ramp up. Service and manufacturing exports had been supported by strong global growth and the depreciation of the Australian dollar over 2018. The persistent drought conditions in New South Wales and bordering regions in Queensland and Victoria had led to a short-term boost to rural exports because livestock slaughter rates had increased and some grain crops had been harvested early to take advantage of higher feed prices. However, the medium-term outlook for farm sector production had been revised lower. ", " Labour market conditions had been stronger than expected. Members noted that much of the employment growth had been in full-time employment and that the participation rate had remained at a high level. The unemployment rate had declined to 5 per cent in September. Unemployment rates in most states had trended lower in recent months and were particularly low in New South Wales and Victoria. The unemployment rate was now expected to decline gradually to around 4¾ per cent by mid 2020, although members noted that some leading indicators of labour demand suggested there could be a more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate in the near term. ", " The improved labour market outlook had led to a modest upward revision to the outlook for wages growth. The recent increases in award and minimum wages were expected to have provided a small boost to wages growth in the September quarter. Members discussed the wage increases associated with recent enterprise bargaining agreements and uncertainties around the extent to which these and ongoing negotiations might flow through to overall wages growth. Members noted that average real earnings had not increased for six years and that wages growth was a key uncertainty for both future consumption growth and inflation. ", " Year-ended inflation had remained low in the September quarter. CPI inflation was 1.9 per cent over the year to the September quarter and had been around 2 per cent since early 2017. Underlying inflation was a little below ½ per cent in the September quarter and around 1¾ per cent over the year. As expected, the quarterly outcome incorporated a large decline in administered prices, reflecting a sharp decline in childcare prices owing to changes in government subsidies and a moderation in utilities inflation. The noticeable step-down in administered price inflation from earlier years was expected to be temporary, although members noted that future outcomes depended on possible government initiatives to reduce cost-of-living pressures. Inflation in the cost of new housing and rents had also been subdued in the September quarter. Inflation was still forecast to increase gradually over time as spare capacity in the economy declines. The brighter outlook for economic activity and the labour market, compared with three months earlier, had led to a small upward revision to the inflation forecasts. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that financial conditions in the advanced economies remained accommodative, although they had tightened somewhat recently. ", " In October, equity prices had declined sharply across the major markets. Analysts had attributed the fall to a range of factors, including higher bond yields, concerns that the pace of earnings growth would decline given trade tensions and building cost pressures, and elevated valuations (particularly in the United States). Members noted, however, that recent corporate earnings, especially in the United States, had grown strongly and had mostly been above forecasts. ", " Members observed that there had generally been little spillover from equity markets to other financial markets. Money market and corporate bond spreads had increased a little but remained relatively low. Term premia for sovereign debt and exchange rate volatility also remained low in the major markets. Members noted that the leveraged loan market had grown rapidly, particularly in the United States, and corporate funding had increasingly shifted to the securities markets rather than bank finance. ", " Monetary policy in the major economies remained accommodative. Members noted that financial market pricing continued to imply that policy settings of central banks are on divergent paths, reflecting differences in spare capacity and/or the inflation outlook across economies. In the United States and Canada, markets were pricing in a further tightening in monetary policy over the coming year. Financial market pricing continued to imply a lower path for the US federal funds rate than suggested by the median projection of Federal Open Market Committee members. Market pricing implied a smaller increase in policy rates over the coming year in the United Kingdom, Norway and Sweden, with rates expected to remain very low in these economies. By contrast, market pricing was consistent with policy rates remaining steady over the following year in Australia and New Zealand, where policy rates had not been lowered to the extent they had in some other economies. In Japan, the euro area and Switzerland, market pricing remained consistent with maintenance of the highly accommodative monetary policy settings in these economies. ", " Members observed that the divergent monetary policy paths had been reflected in long-term government bond yields, which had increased in the United States and Canada over the prior year, but had been broadly unchanged in other major markets and Australia. Members noted that long-term government bond yields in Australia were now clearly below those in the United States as a result. Members also noted that long-term government bond yields remained low by historical standards in the major markets, with inflation expectations contained and term premia particularly low. ", " In Italy, the spread of Italian government bond yields over German Bunds had risen further in October, following the rejection by the European Commission of the Italian Government's draft budget. However, Italian yield spreads remained below the levels seen during the European debt crisis in 2012 and there had been limited spillovers to other European bond markets. Nevertheless, ongoing concerns about Italian fiscal policy settings were likely to remain a focus for financial market participants. ", " Financial conditions in emerging markets had stabilised recently, as earlier political and macro-financial concerns in Turkey, Argentina and Brazil had eased somewhat. After depreciating sharply since the beginning of 2018, these economies' exchange rates had appreciated over the preceding couple of months. This followed some corrective policy responses and an easing in perceived political risk. Exchange rate volatility had also declined from its recent peak across emerging market economies more broadly. However, members noted that there remained a risk that capital outflows from emerging markets could broaden and intensify, prompting a more significant tightening of financial conditions. ", " In China, the authorities had implemented further targeted measures to ease financial conditions in response to slower growth, while balancing their commitment to containing risks in the financial system. In October, banks' reserve requirement ratios were cut by another 1 percentage point, following earlier measures to ensure ample bank liquidity. The decline in Chinese share prices over 2018 had also recently prompted the authorities to announce measures to support the equity market. The renminbi exchange rate had depreciated over 2018 in response to concerns about trade protection and the outlook for growth, as well as the policy measures targeted at easing financial conditions. However, unlike the 2015 depreciation episode, there had been few signs of large-scale capital outflows or direct foreign exchange intervention by the authorities. ", " The Australian dollar had depreciated a little over the course of 2018, but remained in the fairly narrow range observed over recent years on a trade-weighted basis. Members observed that this had reflected offsetting effects on the exchange rate from higher commodity prices, on the one hand, and the decline in Australian bond yields relative to those in other major markets, on the other hand. ", " Members noted that Australian banks' funding costs remained a little higher than in 2017, reflecting the increase in short-term money market rates over the first half of 2018. More recently, the spread of bank bill swap rates relative to overnight indexed swaps (OIS) had declined marginally over the preceding month, while the spread of US LIBOR to OIS had increased. Information from liaison suggested that there had been little change in domestic money market conditions in recent months. The modest increase in funding costs earlier in the year had been passed on by most lenders to existing borrowers with variable-rate business and housing loans. ", " The pace of overall credit growth had been maintained in recent months, as slowing housing credit growth had been offset by a pick-up in business credit growth. The easing in growth in housing credit had reflected a slowing in growth in lending by the major banks. By contrast, growth in housing lending by other authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) had picked up. Housing lending by non-ADIs had continued to grow strongly, although these institutions' share of total housing credit remained small. Members noted that the easing in housing credit growth had been accounted for largely by slower growth in credit extended to investors, which was now close to zero. Growth in lending to owner-occupiers had eased more gradually and remained around 6½ per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms. ", " Members noted that the easing in housing credit growth was likely to reflect both tighter lending conditions and some weakening in demand. Stricter lending criteria had reduced maximum loan amounts. At the same time, however, interest rates offered on new loans remained lower than interest rates on outstanding loans, consistent with banks continuing to compete for new borrowers. ", " Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" As part of a regular annual review process, members considered how the domestic economy had evolved over the preceding year relative to the Bank's forecasts of a year earlier. Members noted that the magnitude of forecast errors for key variables, including GDP growth, the unemployment rate and inflation, had been smaller than the historical averages. Overall, GDP growth had been higher than expected at the time of the November 2017 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. While most components of GDP had turned out to be a little stronger than expected, the main source of the upward surprise had been business investment, owing to unexpected strength in both mining and non-mining investment. In addition, the terms of trade had been higher than expected over the previous year and the Australian dollar had depreciated. Consistent with these developments, labour market outcomes had also been stronger than expected a year earlier and more progress had been made in reducing unemployment than expected. Despite this, wages growth and underlying inflation had evolved largely as expected. Overall, members noted that the economic outcomes over the preceding year had been consistent with the economy continuing on its forecast trajectory of gradually declining spare capacity, with a correspondingly gradual increase in wages growth and inflation. ", " In the context of the annual review of the forecasts, members also reviewed arguments that had been advanced by various commentators during the preceding year for an increase or decrease in the cash rate. Some of these arguments relied on different assessments than had been made by the Board in relation to the benefits of seeking faster progress on the Bank's inflation and unemployment rate objectives, versus the risks to longer-term sustainable growth from further increases in household debt. Other arguments for a change in the cash rate relied on an alternative assessment about the economic outlook and/or the risks around the outlook. Arguments in favour of an increase in the cash rate included that the economy had more momentum than assessed by the Bank; financial stability risks from high levels of household debt required higher interest rates; and a higher cash rate would create room to cut the cash rate in future in response to an adverse event. The prime argument in favour of a decrease in the cash rate was that easier monetary policy could lead to faster progress in achieving the Bank's monetary policy objectives. ", " Members discussed how different scenarios could affect the monetary policy decision, noting that the appropriate policy response would depend on the specifics of the situation, including the underlying factors driving economic developments. For example, in the event of a marked change in the strength of the global economy, the effect on the Australian economy – and thus the appropriate monetary policy response – would depend on any associated move in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar. Members also discussed various scenarios related to the labour market and household expenditure. ", " Turning to the current month's decision, members noted that the global economy had continued to grow strongly and global financial conditions remained accommodative, although conditions had tightened somewhat recently. Most advanced economies were growing at above-trend rates and their labour markets had continued to tighten. This had led to a noticeable pick-up in wages growth. In some economies, most notably the United States, inflationary pressures were building. Growth in China had slowed a little and the authorities had responded to weakness in some sectors of the economy with targeted policy measures, while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector. Members noted that the direction of international trade policy continued to be a significant risk to the global outlook. ", " Against the background of rising global inflationary pressures, a few central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, were expected to continue to reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation gradually. Changes in the expected paths of monetary policy over the preceding year had been reflected in changes to financial market pricing, most notably a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. The associated modest depreciation of the Australian dollar over 2018 was likely to have been helpful for domestic economic growth. ", " Members noted that economic conditions in the Australian economy had continued to improve and had been a little stronger than expected. The outlook for growth had been revised a little higher, mainly as a result of upward revisions to history and recent strong data. Year-ended GDP growth was expected to remain above 3 per cent over 2019, before slowing to around 3 per cent in 2020. Members observed that the outlook for consumption continued to be a source of uncertainty in an environment of slow growth in household incomes, high debt levels and easing conditions in housing markets in some parts of the country. These conditions warranted close monitoring. At the same time, investment had been stronger than expected over the previous year and business conditions were positive; if the recent momentum were to be sustained, business investment could turn out to be stronger than currently expected. However, the drought had led to difficult conditions in parts of the farm sector. ", " Conditions in the labour market had also been stronger than expected and forward-looking indicators of labour demand continued to point to ongoing strength in the near term. As a result, the forecast for the unemployment rate had been revised lower and the forecast for wages growth had been revised slightly higher. Members noted that there continued to be uncertainty about the degree of spare capacity in the labour market and the extent and speed of any pick-up in wages growth relative to the gradual increase incorporated in the latest forecasts. They acknowledged that a gradual increase in wages growth was likely to be necessary for inflation to be sustainably within the target range. ", " Underlying inflation had remained low and stable at around 1¾ per cent, consistent with the previous forecasts, despite stronger-than-expected economic activity. Although there was a possibility of further declines in administered prices in the year ahead, underlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually over the forecast period, to be a little above 2¼ per cent in 2020. ", " Conditions in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets had continued to ease, following significant growth over preceding years. Rent inflation had remained low. Housing credit growth had declined, particularly for investors, but had continued to be higher than growth in household income. Credit conditions were tighter than they had been for some time, partly because lending standards had been tightened following the introduction of supervisory measures to help contain the build-up of risk in household balance sheets. At the same time, home lending rates had remained low and there was strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality. ", " Taking account of the available information on current economic and financial conditions, as well as the latest forecasts, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy would continue to support economic growth and allow for further gradual progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. In these circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate was more likely to be an increase than a decrease, but that there was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress unfolds. Members judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Sovereign debt problems in Europe had also come to the fore again. However, growth in much of east Asia had remained strong. Inflationary pressures continued to be a concern in a number of regions, particularly in much of Asia. ", " Information on the Chinese economy had been mixed, with growth in industrial production appearing to have slowed but growth in investment and exports remaining robust. Construction activity had been strong, partly reflecting the Government's policies to encourage supply of low-cost housing. Policy measures to slow demand, especially in property markets, appeared to have had some effect, with housing price inflation falling in recent months and credit growth moderating. However, consumer price inflation remained elevated. Although vegetable prices had fallen recently, higher commodity prices appeared to be feeding into second-round effects on inflation, and non-food inflation was at its highest rate in more than a decade. This was also contributing to an increase in Chinese export prices. ", " Japanese GDP contracted in the March quarter by nearly 1 per cent and there had been sharp falls in most of the economic indicators for the month of March, following the earthquake and tsunami. Abstracting from the motor vehicle sector, the monthly data for April had shown some signs of stabilisation in activity, and business surveys for May had indicated a recovery was under way. In contrast, production of cars had remained low in April and exports of cars had fallen significantly. Disruptions to supply chains had also resulted in significant falls in sales or production of cars in a range of other countries including the United States, United Kingdom and Thailand, as well as Australia. However, recent indications from the Japanese automotive producers were that production was likely to return to normal levels earlier than had initially been anticipated. ", " March quarter GDP growth remained strong in India and concern over inflation had prompted the central bank to raise its policy rate again. GDP growth was also strong in east Asia (excluding China and Japan), especially in the higher-income economies. Despite recent falls in food prices in a number of economies, inflationary pressures remained, amid limited spare capacity. Members observed that credit growth was high in most Asian economies and monetary policy stances remained relatively accommodative. ", " The recovery in the US economy had lost some momentum. Consumption growth had slowed, possibly reflecting the effect of the rise in fuel prices. The housing market was still very weak, with most of the various measures of nationwide prices around 30 per cent below their peak. In the labour market, the most recent payrolls figures had been disappointing. Business survey measures of activity had fallen from their earlier high levels, but were still at levels consistent with ongoing expansion. ", " Output in the euro area grew strongly in the March quarter, partly due to a recovery from the harsh weather in December. The north-south divide in economic performance in the euro area had continued, with growth strongest in Germany, France and the Netherlands. In contrast, economic conditions in the Italian and Spanish economies remained weak, and there had been a heightening in concerns over the sovereign debt problems in several economies. GDP in Greece had fallen by around 10 per cent from its peak in September 2008 and further declines were expected. Members observed that the economy had been weaker than initially envisaged under the May 2010 IMF/European Union program, and that additional budget measures and asset sales would be needed to meet the program targets for the budget deficit. ", " Commodity prices were mostly lower than at the time of the previous meeting, although they remained at high levels. There had been falls in the prices of oil, base metals and some rural commodities in early May amid a fall in global financial markets, but prices for most commodities had since recovered somewhat. Spot prices for bulk commodities had also softened a little, but contract prices for iron ore and coking coal were expected to remain at near-record levels in the September quarter. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" GDP was estimated to have fallen by 1.2 per cent in the March quarter. The fall in coal and iron ore exports – which reflected weather-related disruptions – had subtracted 1¾ percentage points from GDP growth, with coal exports falling by 27 per cent in the quarter. In contrast to output, domestic final demand had grown solidly in the quarter. All the major components had increased, but growth was particularly strong in business investment. ", " The fall in mining production was expected to be temporary: indeed, iron ore exports were already back at normal levels, and the monthly data for coal exports showed a gradual recovery under way since February, although there was still some way to go before normal levels were regained. The rebound in mining production was expected to add significantly to GDP growth in the June and September quarters. The terms of trade had risen by nearly 6 per cent in the March quarter, and a further large increase to reach a new peak was expected in the June quarter, before a gradual decline over the medium term. ", " The past month had brought further evidence of the expected strength in mining investment. In the national accounts, the rise in business investment in the March quarter was driven by growth in machinery and equipment investment and engineering activity. According to firms' investment plans in the capital expenditure survey, investment in the mining sector was expected to grow very strongly in 2011/12. Other indicators showed that the pipeline of approved or possible projects was at a very high level, although members noted that it was likely that capacity constraints would result in delays or cancellation of some of the projects in the earlier stages of planning. ", " Investment intentions outside the mining sector were considerably weaker, with the capital expenditure survey suggesting a significant downward revision to planned spending on buildings and structures in 2011/12. Non-residential building construction had fallen in the March quarter and there was little evidence of a pick-up in the near term, despite the gradual tightening in office vacancy rates. Residential building approvals were also at fairly low levels, notwithstanding a bounce in apartment approvals in the latest monthly data. ", " Households had continued to be cautious in their spending and borrowing behaviour. With household income growth strong in the March quarter and consumption increasing more moderately, the household saving ratio was estimated to have risen. Members observed that the saving ratio was now back to levels seen in the mid 1980s and that the increase from earlier unsustainably low levels was a positive development. ", " Retail sales data and liaison suggested continued moderate growth in spending in the first two months of the June quarter. Motor vehicle sales had fallen significantly in May, largely reflecting the problems in the global supply chain emanating from Japan. Notwithstanding above-average sentiment about the general outlook for the economy, surveys continued to suggest that households' perceptions of their own personal finances over the coming year were well below average. ", " Consistent with ongoing consumer caution, the housing market had remained soft. Average dwelling prices had fallen modestly so far in 2011, with the weakness mostly in more expensive suburbs and in cities (notably Perth and Brisbane) that had seen a faster run-up in housing prices in earlier years. Housing credit growth had slowed and housing loan approvals had fallen in the first three months of the year, although preliminary numbers for April showed an increase. ", " The unemployment rate had been steady over recent months and around 1 percentage point below its peak in mid 2009. Employment was estimated to have fallen in April, following a large rise in March. Looking through this monthly volatility, however, the pace of employment growth appeared to have slowed from the rapid pace seen in late 2010. ", " The recent data for wages had indicated relatively firm growth, which – given poor aggregate productivity outcomes – implied a high rate of growth in unit labour costs. According to the wage price index, private-sector wages grew by 3.9 per cent over the year to the March quarter, which was above the average pace over the period since 1997, although not as high as the peak rates reached in 2008. Not surprisingly, wage growth had been strongest in Western Australia and in sectors exposed to the mining boom. In the 2011 Annual Wage Review, Fair Work Australia had announced an increase of 3.4 per cent to apply to all Federal awards from July. The decision was made in terms of a uniform percentage increase that would preserve wage relativities, as opposed to the fixed dollar increases for all awards in earlier years. ", " According to the Australian Government Budget for 2011/12, fiscal policy was expected to exert a significant contractionary impulse on aggregate demand over the next two years. The underlying cash balance was forecast to move from a deficit of 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2010/11 to a deficit of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2011/12 and a small surplus in 2012/13. This forecast consolidation reflected both growth in tax revenue and a fall in expenditure as a share of GDP, resulting from a cap on spending growth and the wind-down of fiscal stimulus programs, as had been intended. State government budgets also pointed to some contractionary effects on the economy. These developments in fiscal policy were broadly in line with what had been assumed in the Bank's forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members discussed the sustainability of the Greek sovereign debt situation, noting that market concerns had intensified over the past month. The European Central Bank, European Commission and IMF had just completed their review of Greece's compliance with the terms of the rescue package. Ahead of the announcement of that review, however, there had been extensive debate about whether the rescue package would achieve its goal of putting the Greek economy and its public debt position on a sustainable path. A financial assistance package totalling €78 billion had been endorsed by the European Union for Portugal over the past month. ", " Whereas in earlier months the debt problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal had been largely reflected in the interest rates of those countries, over the past month they had spilled over to long-term rates for some other European countries. ", " Members noted that the renewed concerns about the euro area, together with somewhat weaker macroeconomic data, had seen government bond yields in the major economies fall further in recent weeks, to be around their lowest levels for the year. The 10-year government bond yields in both Germany and the United States had fallen to 3 per cent. Movements in Australian yields had mirrored those in the major markets with <span class=\"no-wrap\">10-year</span> yields on government bonds falling to around 5¼ per cent. ", " Against that backdrop, global equity markets had also weakened over the month. Many markets were now back around their levels at the start of the year, while the Japanese market was more than 5 per cent lower. Resources stocks had declined following weaker commodity prices, while financials stocks had been weighed down by ongoing regulatory and legal challenges. ", " Members noted that volatility in foreign exchange markets had picked up over May along with the euro area concerns. The US dollar had appreciated, most notably against the euro but also against a number of emerging market currencies, such as the Brazilian real, that had previously appreciated strongly. The renminbi had moved up a little against the US dollar, resulting in a slightly larger increase against the currencies of its other trading partners. Having reached a new post-float high against the US dollar in early May, the Australian dollar had since depreciated. ", " Local credit markets had to date been broadly unaffected by these offshore developments. Issuance had been robust for banks and corporates as well as for asset-backed securities. The one-notch ratings downgrade by Moody's of Australia's four major banks had had no effect on banks' bond spreads, mainly because the downgrade had been expected for some time. ", " Market expectations of monetary policy tightening in the major economies had been pushed back over the past month, in part reflecting more mixed economic data. In Australia, market expectations had shifted higher after the release of the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, but subsequently fell back following softer domestic data. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members considered that the medium-term outlook for the economy was broadly as discussed at the May meeting. While inflation was currently in the bottom half of the target range in underlying terms, this had been partly due to the disinflationary effects of the appreciation of the exchange rate and the earlier moderation in labour costs. If the economy evolved in line with the staff forecasts, GDP growth would be somewhat above trend over the next few years, led by growth in the resources sector. A gradual pick-up in inflation could be expected under this scenario. ", " This outlook suggested that further tightening in monetary policy would be necessary at some point. Members considered, however, that the flow of data over the past month had not added any urgency to the need for an adjustment to policy. While there had been additional evidence of the coming strong pick-up in investment in the resources sector, activity remained quite subdued in some other important parts of the economy, partly reflecting the Board's earlier actions as well as the appreciation of the exchange rate. Credit growth remained quite moderate and asset prices had softened. In addition, the global activity data had been somewhat softer and downside risks to the international economy had become a little more prominent over the past month, especially in the case of sovereign debt problems in Europe. Accordingly, members judged that it would be prudent to leave the stance of policy unchanged, pending further data on international developments and on the strength of domestic demand and inflationary pressures. They therefore considered that the current monetary policy setting was appropriate. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.75 per cent. "]}},

"], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Philip Lowe (Assistant Governor, Economic), Tony Richards (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion with a review of financial markets. ", " Developments in Greece had again been the main factor influencing markets over the past month. Pessimism had been the dominant theme until late June. Sentiment improved after further fiscal measures were formulated and passed by the Greek parliament. The new package was necessary for the next tranche of official funds to be provided under the original EU and IMF program. There was continuing uncertainty about how the funding gap for 2012 would be filled, given Greece's inability to raise funds in bond markets at present. (The original support program had assumed that Greece could raise around €25 billion in the market from 2012.) ", " Members were briefed on some of the options under consideration for closing that funding gap. Part would come through further budget measures and additional official assistance, while part would come through participation by current bond holders in a debt rollover. The latter appeared to face some hurdles, however, including the need to avoid any such proposal being characterised as a debt default. An uncontrolled default could be damaging for the global economy, particularly if there were contagion to other countries in Europe and a significant loss of confidence in the ability of policymakers to manage the fall-out. ", " Reflecting the concerns about Greece, the yield spread between German Bunds and sovereign bonds of those European countries receiving financial assistance from the EU and IMF – Greece, Ireland and Portugal – all reached new highs. Spreads on 10-year Italian and Spanish government bonds also reached their widest levels in around 15 years. ", " Despite these movements, there was little sign of the tensions in the wider global money markets that had been evident in May 2010, when the Greek fiscal concerns first came to the fore, or in 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers. Members noted that spreads in the interbank market were little changed. The problems in Greece had combined with softer global macroeconomic data to cause government bond yields in the major markets to decline to their lowest levels this year, although yields had risen again in recent days on the passage of the Greek austerity package. ", " Members observed that the Federal Reserve had completed its second program of asset purchases and had reaffirmed its intention to maintain its balance sheet at the current size for the period ahead. For Europe, the market believed that the ECB was almost certain to raise its policy rate at its meeting later in the week. Other central banks, including in Brazil, China, India and South Korea, had tightened monetary policy further over the past month. ", " Global equity markets had fallen further on the Greek concerns and weaker-than-expected data in a number of countries, before reversing those declines following the passage of the Greek austerity package. European bank share prices had been particularly affected by these developments. The Australian share market had been primarily driven by these global factors. ", " Members also discussed the volatility in foreign exchange markets, which had remained elevated. By and large, the US dollar, Japanese yen and Swiss franc (along with the renminbi) had moved broadly together against the euro and most other currencies, including the Australian dollar. ", " Australian credit markets continued to be relatively unaffected by the global uncertainty over the past month. Issuance by Australian banks, both secured and unsecured, had remained solid and pricing had not materially changed. ", " Members noted that market pricing indicated that no change in the cash rate was expected at this meeting. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The pace of growth in the global economy had eased over the past few months, although this partly reflected the Japanese supply-chain disruptions, which would probably lessen over the months ahead. While the IMF had made a small downward revision to its outlook for world growth in 2011, its central forecast was still for growth to be at, or above, average in both 2011 and 2012. Downside risks had, however, increased, particularly because of the fiscal and banking problems in Europe. ", " The Chinese economy continued to expand at a solid pace. Growth in investment and exports remained strong, while growth in industrial production and retail sales had moderated in recent months. The efforts of the authorities to slow demand through tighter monetary policy and administrative controls were having an effect, with growth in credit and property prices slowing noticeably over the past year. The year-ended inflation rate had risen to 5.5 per cent in May, driven by higher non-food inflation, and recent increases in pork and other food prices were likely to result in further increases in overall inflation. Members observed that the rise in inflation implied that real interest rates were at low or negative levels. ", " In Japan, gradual progress was being made towards easing the supply-chain disruptions following the earthquake and tsunami. Industrial production rose strongly in May, and manufacturers expected another large increase in production in June. Output in the automotive industry, where the supply-chain disruptions had been most acute, appeared likely to return to normal more quickly than earlier expected, although the supply of electricity in the Tokyo region would be a constraint on production during the summer months. Retail trade had grown in April and May, but consumer confidence remained at low levels, despite some recovery in May. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, there had been a general softening of the industrial production and trade data in April. This appeared to be largely the result of disruptions to trade in intermediate goods resulting from the problems in Japan, and there were indications of a pick-up in some countries in May. ", " The difficulties in Europe, particularly Greece, remained a significant downside risk for the global economy. Despite the passage of legislation to implement new austerity measures, Greece had some way to go to resolve its fiscal problems and reduce its high domestic cost structure. ", " In the United States, a range of indicators suggested that growth had moderated in recent months. The recovery in consumption had lost momentum, which members attributed in part to households adjusting to higher oil prices. The housing sector remained extremely weak and the pick-up in employment had been disappointingly slow. As in many countries, the recent industrial production data had been affected by supply-chain problems in the automotive industry, although machinery and equipment investment had been growing solidly. ", " The prices of most commodities had fallen recently, although they generally remained at high levels owing to ongoing strong demand driven by growth in Asia. The prices of base metals and oil had fallen through June, as had the spot price for iron ore, although there had been some recovery in prices as the news on Greece had improved. There had also been a decline in the prices of some rural commodities, although members observed that wool had been an exception. Notwithstanding the recent declines in most commodities, Australia's terms of trade for the June quarter were likely to have been the highest on record. ", " Following the earlier surge in commodity prices, which had boosted year-ended headline inflation around the world, the recent decline in commodity prices, including food prices, was flowing through to a short-term easing in inflation pressures in some countries. Nevertheless, with global growth having been quite strong, underlying inflation was still trending up in many countries, including the United States. In emerging economies, inflation remained uncomfortably high, particularly in India and China. In Europe, inflation remained above the ECB's target, and well above target in the United Kingdom. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The multi-speed nature of the Australian economy was clearly evident in recent economic data. The resources sector remained strong, as did some service sectors. However, household cautiousness and the high exchange rate were having a dampening effect on a number of other sectors. Supply-chain disruptions, due to events in Japan, had also caused a fall in motor vehicle production and sales. Survey measures of overall business conditions and confidence showed significant differences across industries, but overall conditions remained around their long-term averages. ", " The unemployment rate had held steady at 4.9 per cent in May and had been around this level for about six months. Employment growth had slowed from the rapid pace in 2010, partly due to slower growth in the estimated working-age population. There had been some decline in the number of vacancies and job advertisements, although the overall vacancy rate remained at a high level. Employment growth was strong in the mining and business services sectors, and also in household services such as health and education. However, employment was flat or falling in manufacturing and goods distribution. The strong demand for mining-related occupations had led to increased wages pressures in some of these areas, but these pressures remained fairly localised. Overall growth in wages was running around the rate seen prior to the downturn, although the weak growth in measured productivity meant that unit labour costs looked to be rising strongly. ", " The household sector continued to be cautious in its spending and borrowing behaviour. Following a solid rise in April, data for retail sales for May had shown a fall, although imports of consumption goods (excluding motor vehicles) had been strong over the past couple of months. Despite official data recording quite strong growth in disposable income and overall measures of consumer sentiment being around their long-run average, households' perceptions about the state of their finances remained well below average. There had been little growth in nominal wealth over the past year, with housing prices having softened and equity prices lower recently. Members observed that this was in contrast to the experience of much of the past two decades. Housing credit growth had eased further, to its slowest pace in many years, although housing loan approvals had picked up in April and May. ", " The housing market remained soft, with nationwide measures of prices recording another small fall in May, although with some differences among cities. Mortgage arrears rates had risen over recent months, although they were still much lower than in most other countries. Arrears rates had increased the most in Western Australia and Queensland, where house prices had been falling after large run-ups in previous years. Members observed that this was similar to the pattern seen in Sydney following the rapid growth in house prices in the early 2000s: households that entered the market around the peak in prices, when lending standards were less stringent, had been more likely later to experience difficulties. In contrast, the arrears rates for borrowers who purchased their home in 2009, when lending standards were tighter, were not particularly high compared with earlier cohorts, despite these borrowers experiencing a significant increase in interest rates since they took out their loans. ", " The outlook for investment continued to be very strong, driven by the mining sector. Some companies were reporting rising costs in resource investment projects. A number of large LNG projects were under construction or progressing through the approvals process, and there was a high level of spending on projects to expand production capacity for iron ore in the Pilbara. Consistent with this, capital imports had trended higher over recent months. In contrast, investment in the non-mining sector remained soft, with signs yet to emerge of a pick-up in non-residential construction. ", " The recovery of coal exports from the Queensland floods was taking significantly longer than earlier expected, and the return to full capacity could be delayed to early 2012. In contrast, iron ore exports had already bounced back from the weather-induced weakness seen in the March quarter. The recovery in coal and iron ore exports was expected to boost GDP growth significantly over the next few quarters. Nonetheless, the delay in the recovery of coal production plus continuing signs of cautiousness on the part of households meant that growth in 2011 was likely to be lower than had been expected a couple of months earlier. ", " There had been little new information on inflation over the past month, with the June quarter CPI to be released on 27 July. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" While the central scenario for the world economy showed robust growth over the coming year, global growth had slowed in the June quarter. The downside risks associated with a possible adverse European financial shock looked more significant than had been the case a few months ago. Whether the slower global growth would persist was unknown. Growth in China had slowed somewhat, although it remained strong overall. ", " Members noted that with households remaining cautious and the impact of earlier fiscal measures abating, growth in aggregate demand was not showing signs of a further pick-up yet. The pace of employment growth had for some months been more moderate than had been the case in 2010, and the overall labour market was therefore not tightening significantly further at present. A number of indicators were consistent with overall growth at around average pace with noticeable differences between sectors. The delays in the recovery of coal production and supply-chain disruptions resulting from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami also meant that GDP growth through 2011 was unlikely to be as strong as earlier forecast, with some of the recovery being pushed into the early part of 2012. ", " Notwithstanding this, members considered that the continuing strong economic performance of Asian economies meant that the medium-term outlook for the Australian economy remained strong. The prices of Australia's main commodity exports were at elevated levels, and very strong growth in investment, led by the resources sector, was still expected over the next couple of years. ", " The extent to which these forces would strain the economy's productive capacity over time would be a key determinant of inflation. Members noted, however, that the flow of recent information suggested both that there was more time to assess the likely strength of inflationary pressures in Australia and that it would be prudent to use that time. Members noted that the CPI outcome for the June quarter, to be published later in the month, would be important in helping to shape views about inflation, and therefore the future path of interest rates. Accordingly, members considered that the current mildly restrictive setting of monetary policy remained appropriate.

"], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Philip Lowe (Assistant Governor, Economic), Tony Richards (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion with a review of financial markets. ", " Concerns over sovereign debt both in Europe and the United States continued to buffet financial markets over the past month. Early in July, concerns about debt in smaller countries in the euro area spread to Italy and Spain, causing government bond yields in those countries to rise to their highest levels since the inception of the euro in 1999. Concerns also spread to Belgium and, to a lesser extent, France. ", " It was against this backdrop that the European Union agreed on a new rescue package for Greece. While all the details were not yet apparent, it involved additional funding from the EU and the IMF, a lengthening of the maturities of the EU loans and a significant lowering of the interest rate, to around 3½ per cent under current conditions. Members noted that similar adjustments were to be made to the rescue packages for Ireland and Portugal. It was envisaged that private-sector bondholders would participate in the rescue package by rolling over or exchanging their Greek debt into bonds of longer maturities, which would effectively translate into a ‘haircut’ for bondholders of around 20 per cent. While the package would mean that Greece would not need to access the market for new funding until 2014, its ultimate effect on Greece's overall indebtedness remained unclear. ", " Members noted that the reaction in financial markets to the new package initially had been favourable – with spreads on euro area sovereign debt retracing part of their earlier rise – but that this had subsequently faded. ", " The other major factor affecting financial markets over the past month was the difficulty the US political system had in reaching an agreement to increase the US Government debt ceiling, with agreement reached only the day before the ceiling would have become binding. Also unsettling markets was speculation that the United States could lose its AAA credit rating. ", " There was little movement in Treasury yields prior to the agreement being reached, with market liquidity thin as participants awaited the outcome of the negotiations. Yields fell following the agreement, though this was also in the context of weaker US economic data released at the time. ", " Members observed that the largest impact of this uncertainty had been in currency markets, where the US dollar had depreciated against most other currencies, reaching multi-year lows in a number of cases. This was particularly stark in the case of the Swiss franc, which was viewed as a ‘safe haven’ from the perceived economic problems in both the United States and Europe. The Swiss franc had appreciated against the US dollar by around 5 per cent in the past month and 30 per cent over the past year. The Australian dollar had also appreciated strongly and rose further following the release of the CPI data in late July to reach multi-decade highs against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. ", " Global equity markets, too, had been buffeted by these developments. Bank shares were particularly affected, with European bank shares faring the worst. Movements in the Australian equity market were similar. ", " Money markets, in contrast, had experienced only relatively modest effects from the tensions in the United States and Europe. While rising over the month, spreads on short-term market debt remained considerably lower than the levels reached in 2008. US money market funds had reduced their exposure to European banks, both by not rolling over debt issued by these banks as it became due and by shortening the maturity of any debt that was rolled over. Australian banks benefited from this development, with the US money market funds purchasing more of their debt instead. ", " Domestic credit markets overall remained largely unaffected by these offshore developments. Issuance by Australian banks remained strong over the past month, onshore as well as offshore, and their funding costs and lending rates were little changed. ", " In reviewing changes in monetary policy settings around the world, members noted that the European Central Bank had increased its policy rate in July, as expected, though the likelihood attached by market participants to further increases had been scaled back. There was no market expectation of any policy rate increase in the United States and the United Kingdom in the period ahead because of weaker-than-expected data. In contrast, monetary policy had been tightened further in Brazil, China and India, as well as in some other smaller economies, over the past month. ", " Market expectations about monetary policy in Australia had fluctuated in a wide range. While the European and US debt concerns had seen the market price reflect a greater probability of future easing, this was reversed following the release of the higher-than-expected CPI for the June quarter. For this meeting, the market expected no change in the cash rate. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The pace of growth in the global economy had slowed in the June quarter. In the case of Asia, the slowdown appeared to reflect, at least partly, disruptions to supply chains following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. However, there had also been a broader slowdown in a number of advanced economies, including the United States. Confidence had been adversely affected by the sovereign debt problems in Europe and the debate over the debt ceiling in the United States. While the central scenario of most forecasters remained for global growth to be average, or a bit above, over the next year or so, the downside risks had increased. ", " The Chinese economy had continued to grow strongly in the June quarter, and most of the monthly indicators suggested that growth remained firm. The main exception was the trade data, with the volume of imports showing no growth over the past nine months or so, and exports declining in May and June after earlier strong growth. Inflation had continued to pick up, reaching 6.4 per cent over the year to June. While prices for food, especially pork, had contributed significantly, non-food inflation was at its highest level in a decade. ", " In Japan, economic activity was picking up as the supply-side problems eased, although a full recovery of industrial production was not expected until after the summer. There was also some pick-up evident in industrial production elsewhere in Asia, including a significant rebound in vehicle production in Thailand, where Japanese manufacturers account for the bulk of production. In economies other than Japan, consumption growth remained firm and unemployment rates were still trending down. Year-ended core inflation rates had moved higher and monetary policy was gradually being tightened across the region. ", " The recent US national accounts confirmed that the economy had slowed materially in 2011. Growth in the June quarter had come in below expectations and growth in the March quarter had been revised down significantly. The earlier data had also been revised to show a deeper recession than earlier estimated, with the latest estimates showing that output had not yet returned to its pre-crisis level. The unemployment rate had picked up recently, with growth in private-sector employment weak and further falls in public-sector employment. Despite some easing in energy prices, consumption growth remained weak and members noted that the debate about public finances appeared to have further depressed household confidence. One bright spot in the US economy, however, was that business investment was continuing to pick up, supported by strong profitability. Core inflation had risen in the first half of 2011, in part reflecting second-round effects from earlier increases in commodity prices. ", " The recovery continued in the larger euro area countries, although unemployment rates in most countries remained high. Concerns about the Greek fiscal situation had eased a little for the time being, although members noted that Greece still faced a very significant task in improving its competitiveness and public finances. ", " Members discussed the downside risks to global growth, in particular those risks stemming from the fiscal problems in the United States and Europe. It was possible that these could play out in a disruptive manner, leading to a marked rise in global risk aversion, as had occurred in 2008. While the financial exposures were better understood than in the earlier episode of private-sector debt problems, there would be less scope for monetary and fiscal policy to be eased in many of the large economies in the event of a marked slowing in global growth. ", " The prices of oil, base metals and bulk commodities had tended to strengthen over the previous month, but were still modestly below their peaks earlier in the year. Overall, Australia's terms of trade had reached their highest level on record in the June quarter and were now expected to increase further in the September quarter, before declining gradually as more global capacity in iron ore and coal came on line. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The main economic news over the past month had been the inflation data. In the June quarter, the CPI had increased by 0.9 per cent, to be 3.6 per cent higher over the year. Measures of underlying inflation were running at 2½–2¾ per cent over the year, which was higher than in 2010. ", " The year-ended headline inflation rate continued to be boosted by increases in the price of fruit, in particular banana prices, which were nearly five times their pre-cyclone level. However, vegetable prices had fallen in the quarter as production recovered after the floods. Petrol prices had also risen in the quarter and the CPI measure of deposit &amp; loan facilities – which would be removed from the CPI in the September quarter – was also estimated to have risen significantly. Utilities prices fell slightly in the quarter, reflecting seasonal factors, but would increase strongly in the September quarter. There had been larger-than-expected increases in a wide range of retail goods in the June quarter, notwithstanding the appreciation of the exchange rate and subdued level of consumer spending. While it was possible that this was a result of changes in the timing of discounting, it might also reflect cost pressures coming from an increase in global prices, as well as higher costs for a range of domestic inputs at a time when productivity growth was low. ", " There had been further evidence of cautious behaviour in the household sector. While there had been no official data on retail sales since the July meeting, the staff's liaison suggested that retail spending had been weak since mid May. Measures of consumer confidence had declined recently and were now below average. Housing credit growth had slowed further and the rate of credit card debt repayment had picked up. Housing price data suggested that nationwide prices had fallen slightly over recent months, to be down by around 2 per cent over the past year. Members noted that some of the developments in the household sector over recent years, most notably the significant increase in the saving ratio from the low rates seen in the early 2000s, had reduced the medium-term vulnerabilities of the economy. In addition, they observed that, in contrast to these various signs of household caution, there had been very strong growth in overseas travel by Australians over recent months. ", " Survey-based measures of business conditions remained around long-run average levels, although there were very significant differences across sectors, and measures of confidence had fallen to below-average levels. While business credit had fallen over the past couple of months, members observed that lending to unincorporated businesses had been rising gradually since early in the year. Imports of capital and intermediate goods had been quite strong in recent months, consistent with a pick-up in investment in the resources sector. Members noted that the past month had seen the announcement of final investment approval for another large LNG project. The data on coal shipments from Queensland for June had shown a significant pick-up, although industry sources indicated that coal production may not return to normal levels until early in 2012. ", " The unemployment rate had held steady at 4.9 per cent in June. Employment growth had clearly slowed from the rapid pace over much of 2010 and the unemployment rate was no longer falling. The forward-looking indicators continued to point to moderate employment growth over the period ahead, although the staff's liaison with businesses indicated some caution in hiring plans. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. The growth forecast for 2011 had been lowered to 3¼ per cent, 1 percentage point lower than the May forecast. This revision mostly reflected the delayed recovery in coal production, with the remainder largely accounted for by weaker growth in consumption. With some of the recovery in coal production pushed out to 2012 and investment picking up strongly, growth was expected to be around 3¾ per cent in both 2012 and 2013. Mining investment was expected to increase from its already elevated level of around 4 per cent of GDP to more than 6 per cent in 2012/13, and the terms of trade were forecast to remain very high, although down from current levels. Growth in consumption was expected to remain relatively subdued, with some further increase in the household saving ratio expected over the coming year. Members observed that significant structural adjustment was likely over coming years given the high level of the exchange rate relative to its average over the past decade or so. ", " In terms of inflation, the recent outcomes provided further evidence that the disinflationary influences stemming from the late 2008 slowdown had passed. However, subdued household demand and the appreciation of the exchange rate were likely to exert some dampening influence on inflation in the period ahead. In preparing the forecasts, the staff had included the estimated effects of the Government's intention to introduce a price on carbon, which was expected to add around 0.7 percentage point to headline inflation in the second half of 2012, with a smaller effect on underlying inflation. Incorporating these effects, underlying inflation was forecast to be 3 per cent or a little higher over the next few years. The rate of CPI inflation was expected to be above 3 per cent at the end of the forecast period. ", " Members recognised that the effects of instability overseas could pose a downside risk to the domestic economy. Of the domestic risks, the main uncertainty was the behaviour of households, as saving could increase further in an environment of uncertainty. Members also noted the importance of productivity outcomes for growth and inflation. Australia's productivity growth over the past five to ten years had been weak, with growth in output largely accounted for by growth in the factors of production. Growth in incomes had been held up by the rise in the terms of trade over this period. However, with the forecasts suggesting that the terms of trade were likely to be subtracting from income growth over coming years, a significant pick-up in productivity growth would be required to sustain real income growth around the rates seen in recent decades. Members noted that the task facing monetary policy in future would become more difficult if a continuation of poor productivity growth were combined with an expectation of growth in nominal wages and profits at the same sorts of rates seen over the past two decades. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that the global economy was continuing to expand, though growth was unbalanced between regions, and there had been some slowing in the pace of growth in recent months. Significantly, the downside risks had become more pronounced recently. There was considerable uncertainty about how persistent the current slowdown would turn out to be; when the fiscal problems in Europe and the United States would be resolved; and what effect the ongoing market volatility would have on the global economy. At the same time, commodity prices were remaining high and this was feeding through into higher rates of global inflation. ", " Domestically, there were significant divergences between sectors. Activity in parts of the economy was subdued, with consumers remaining cautious and business confidence having fallen somewhat. This was being mirrored in limited appetite for debt by both households and businesses. The appreciation of the exchange rate and the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus were also contributing to softness in various parts of the economy. In contrast, the boom in the resources sector was benefiting some other sectors. Overall, members noted that surveys suggested that business conditions, in aggregate, were around the average level of the past two decades and that the unemployment rate was at a low level. ", " The recent inflation data had been higher than expected. Year-ended CPI inflation had increased, partly reflecting the extreme weather events earlier in the year. As these effects reversed, CPI inflation was expected to decline. Measures of underlying inflation had also picked up, and it was reasonable to conclude that the earlier easing in underlying inflation had run its course. While recent year-ended figures remained consistent with the 2–3 per cent target, members believed there were grounds for concern about the medium-term outlook for inflation, given the relatively limited spare capacity in the economy, the widespread increase in cost pressures, including in imported goods, and the relatively low rate of productivity improvement. ", " Members considered whether the recent information warranted further policy tightening. The argument for tightening further was that underlying inflation had started to pick up and the central projection in the staff forecasts envisaged it rising above the target range during the forecast period. ", " The case against tightening at this meeting was that the downside risks to demand had probably increased, as a result of the acute uncertainty in global financial markets over the recent period. If the financial market turmoil continued, it could further weaken household and business confidence. This in turn could weaken the outlook for demand relative to the central forecast and, over the medium term, dampen the inflation outlook. ", " In considering the current stance of policy, members noted that although interest rates were only a little above average, credit growth had slowed over recent months and was very subdued by historical standards. Asset prices had softened and the exchange rate was high. While various other factors were affecting these variables, taken together they suggested that financial conditions were already exerting a reasonable degree of restraint. ", " Having considered all these factors, members judged that it was prudent to leave the setting of monetary policy steady at this meeting, and to continue to assess the outlook for growth and inflation at future meetings.

These concerns had led to particular focus on the financial strength of European banks. ", " Major share price indices had fallen by around 15 per cent, with even bigger declines in Europe. Financial stocks had been particularly affected. Government bond yields in the developed economies had fallen to new lows, with the 10-year US Treasury yield and German Bund yield both falling below 2 per cent, notwithstanding Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade of the sovereign credit rating of the United States to AA+. ", " In Europe, however, doubts about the fiscal positions of European governments had spread to Italy and Spain. This had led to significant increases in government bond yields in these countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) resumed purchases of government debt, including, for the first time, the debt of Italy and Spain. ", " Unease about the European banking system resulted in large declines in stock prices, together with a marked widening in credit spreads. Besides the ongoing concerns about exposure to ‘peripheral’ Europe, there were fears about the US dollar funding needs of European banks, as US money market funds continued to reduce their funding of European banks. Members noted that Australian banks had benefited from the reallocation of these funds. In addition, the ECB's US dollar swap line with the Federal Reserve was tapped for the first time in several months, although by only one bank and for a small amount. ", " As financial market concerns intensified, there were large appreciations of the Swiss franc and the yen. In the first case, this represented a flight to a perceived safe haven, which had also seen the gold price reach new highs. In the second, it reflected the oft-seen repatriation of funds by Japanese investors at times of financial turmoil. In response, the Swiss National Bank significantly boosted the supply of Swiss francs in the domestic market – resulting in negative short-term interest rates – while the Japanese authorities intervened directly in the foreign exchange market. Despite these actions, both currencies remained around historical highs. ", " More generally, foreign exchange market volatility was somewhat less than in other markets, although still elevated. The Australian dollar traded through a large range, but was more stable than equity markets; this was in contrast to 2008, when the Australian dollar tended to move <em lang=\"la\">pari passu</em> with movements in global equity prices. The Chinese renminbi had tended to appreciate, which was also different from earlier periods of financial volatility, when the authorities tended to maintain a steady peg to the US dollar. ", " Turning to monetary policy, members noted that in the United States the Federal Reserve had announced a commitment to keep its policy rate at zero for at least the next two years. In Europe, where the ECB had increased its policy rate as recently as July, the market now expected a rate reduction by the end of the year. ", " Members were informed that, in Australia, market pricing <em lang=\"la\">prima facie</em> pointed to expectations of large cuts in the cash rate by the end of the year, but a range of technical factors meant that market pricing might not be giving an accurate reading of expectations in the current circumstances. ", " The decline in government bond yields globally was reflected in the local market, with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">10-year</span> yield reaching a low of 4¼ per cent in late August and the 3-year yield declining to as low as 3½ per cent. The spreads on state government debt widened sharply, as liquidity in that market deteriorated (though yields still declined in absolute terms). This reflected the fact that while there had been considerable buying of Commonwealth Government securities by offshore investors, particularly foreign central banks, those investors generally have a smaller appetite for state debt. ", " The heightened volatility in markets resulted in very low bond issuance globally and in the domestic market. In any event, the Australian banks did not need to issue, given strong deposit inflows both on and offshore, and slow balance sheet growth. Indeed, the strength of deposit growth and the decline in the yield curve saw a reduction in some deposit rates as well as some fixed-term lending rates. ", " The local share market also moved generally in line with its global counterparts, but in contrast to recent months, it tended to outperform other markets. Earnings reports released during the month were, on balance, either in line with or in excess of analysts' expectations, although some of these expectations had been pared back in recent months. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " Compared with the pre-crisis period, banking systems in the major countries had strengthened their capital and funding positions over recent years. Most of them also continued to report profits in the most recent period, though overall returns on equity remained below pre-crisis averages. It remained the case, however, that many banks were still dealing with elevated levels of non-performing loans, particularly property-related loans, and their loan-loss provisioning was no longer declining rapidly from the peaks seen during the crisis. Banks in Europe were also carrying large exposures to sovereign debt whose creditworthiness had declined. Ongoing weak credit growth was weighing on banks' underlying revenue growth and had dampened property markets in the major economies. ", " The Australian banking system remained in a relatively strong condition. The recent global market turbulence contributed to falls in Australian banks' share prices and some tightening in wholesale funding conditions, but the overall effect had been modest compared with the experience in most other countries and in 2008. The Australian banking system was better placed to cope with periods of market strain than it was before the crisis, having substantially strengthened its liquidity, funding and capital positions in recent years. Profitability for the major banks had continued to improve to near pre-crisis levels, mainly because of declines in provisioning for bad and doubtful debts. While non-performing assets had yet to show significant signs of improvement, the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets remained well below the early 1990s peak. ", " The Australian insurance industry had coped well with the elevated levels of claims from the natural disasters at the start of 2011, assisted by robust reinsurance arrangements. ", " Members discussed the financial position of the household sector in Australia. Over the past year, the household saving rate increased further and the debt-to-income ratio declined slightly. Given the recent renewed volatility in global financial markets, the prevailing mood of caution among households appeared unlikely to lift in the near term. While households in aggregate were managing their debt levels well, the mortgage arrears rate had drifted up over the first half of the year, but from a low level by international standards. Moreover, this rise mainly related to loans taken out prior to 2009, when banks' lending standards were weaker; newer loans were performing well despite an increase in interest rates. ", " The business sector in Australia was experiencing mixed conditions: the mining and related sectors continued to benefit from the resources boom, while other sectors, including retailing, continued to face headwinds from subdued consumer spending and the high exchange rate. Sectoral measures of profits and business confidence had therefore diverged. Having deleveraged considerably, the business sector had attained a stronger financial position than it was in several years ago. Demand by businesses for external funding remained weak, partly because the business sector had been able to finance a larger share of its investment through internal funding in recent years, as much of that investment had been concentrated in sectors such as mining, where profitability had increased the most. ", " Members were briefed on recent international work to strengthen the regulation of financial systems. National authorities in most countries, including Australia, were in the process of deciding how best to implement the Basel III bank capital and liquidity reforms. The recent focus of the international reform agenda, however, had been on developing a complementary policy framework to address the risks posed by systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Agreement was close to being reached on a methodology to identify banks that were systemically important in a global context, along with the level and form of additional capital that these institutions would be required to hold above the Basel III requirements. Another aspect of this work was the development of a set of principles on effective resolution regimes for SIFIs, which sought to enhance the ability of authorities to resolve distressed SIFIs without disrupting the wider financial system or exposing taxpayers to losses. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The recent volatility in financial markets had added to the uncertainty about the global economic outlook and followed softer-than-expected June quarter GDP outcomes in a number of economies. These developments had contributed to declines in measures of consumer sentiment and business conditions in August in a number of countries. In addition, a number of private-sector forecasters had lowered their forecasts for global growth in 2011 and 2012. While it remained to be seen whether the financial market turbulence foreshadowed a period of significantly weaker growth in the global economy, members noted that circumstances differed from those in late 2008. ", " The Chinese economy had continued to grow solidly, but at a slightly slower pace than earlier in the year. Growth in retail sales and fixed asset investment had slowed somewhat, although investment in the interior provinces remained very strong. Exports in July had picked up further, although import growth remained weak. Inflation remained uncomfortably high, rising to 6.5 per cent over the year to July, but the earlier upward pressure on food prices appeared to have eased somewhat. The authorities had taken a further step over the past month to tighten policy by expanding reserve requirements to a wider range of deposits. ", " Elsewhere in Asia, there had been further signs that the disruptions to supply chains following the Japanese earthquake had lessened. In Japan, GDP contracted in the June quarter, but by a smaller amount than generally had been expected, and production in the automotive and electronics industries continued to recover towards pre-earthquake levels in July. June quarter GDP outcomes for other countries in the region were generally soft, although domestic demand had continued to grow solidly. More timely monthly data showed strong growth in exports from these countries. Year-ended rates of inflation had increased, particularly in Korea, though monthly inflation rates had levelled out for some countries. ", " In the United States, the economic data for July had been a little better than the data for previous months. However, the housing market remained weak and the payrolls data for August had been disappointing. Furthermore, the softer June quarter GDP data, fiscal concerns and the turbulence in financial markets had resulted in sharp falls in a number of the measures of consumer confidence and business conditions in August. Despite ongoing weakness in the economy, the pace of core inflation had been picking up gradually. Recent Congressional Budget Office projections showed that there would be considerable challenges in putting federal finances on a more sustainable medium-term path. Members noted also that the fiscal pressures faced by state and local governments were resulting in significant public-sector job losses. ", " Business and consumer sentiment had also declined in Europe, although confidence remained well above the levels seen in late 2008. GDP growth in Europe had been soft in the June quarter, with Germany and France recording little growth after having led the recovery over the previous year. This slowing in momentum, if sustained, was likely to compound the fiscal challenges facing the economies of southern Europe. ", " The prices of most exchange-traded commodities had fallen over August, though the falls were relatively small compared with those seen in late 2008 and prices remained at high levels. In contrast, spot prices for iron ore and thermal coal had risen slightly over the month, with physical demand from Asia continuing to be strong. Overall, Australia's terms of trade were expected to be at their highest level on record in the September quarter, before gradually declining as global production capacity in iron ore and coal increased. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" In Australia, while the recent economic data continued to show conditions varying significantly across industries, the National Australia Bank survey for July indicated that conditions in the business sector as a whole remained around their long-run average. ", " Members noted that the high exchange rate was having a material effect on the competitiveness of a number of industries, particularly manufacturing, tourism and education. The Bank's liaison suggested that a growing realisation that the exchange rate was likely to remain at a relatively high level was contributing to a re-evaluation of business strategies. In some cases this was leading to restructuring and even closure of facilities. However, in others it was prompting investment in new capital equipment to remain competitive, consistent with a pick-up in investment intentions in the manufacturing sector reported in the ABS capital expenditure survey. More broadly, however, the capital expenditure survey suggested that investment plans outside the mining sector remained subdued. Recent data for private non-residential building approvals remained weak. ", " In contrast, industries exposed to the resources sector continued to experience very strong conditions. Engineering construction grew strongly over the first half of the year, and the capital expenditure survey provided further evidence that firms in the resources sector were planning a very significant increase in investment in 2011/12. Over recent months, imports of capital goods had increased strongly. Demand from the mining industry continued to drive growth in a range of business services industries, including engineering, accounting, IT and consulting. ", " Public-sector building activity had continued to fall as projects funded by the fiscal stimulus were completed. Nevertheless, public building activity was at quite a high level as a share of GDP, in part reflecting construction of hospitals, while the relatively high level of spending on public engineering projects reflected activity in a range of areas, including road, rail and desalination plants. ", " Consistent with developments overseas, measures of consumer confidence had fallen further in August, to be well below average levels. In particular, consumers' perceptions of their personal finances were very weak, and households had become more concerned about the possibility of rising unemployment. The retail trade data for July had been better than for earlier months, although recent liaison with retailers suggested that conditions remained soft, especially for higher-end retailers. However, members observed that other measures of household spending showed greater strength, with overseas departures at high levels and motor vehicle sales rebounding strongly as the availability of cars had improved following the disruption to supplies from the Japanese earthquake. ", " The housing market remained weak, with nationwide measures of dwelling prices falling again in July, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3–4 per cent</span> below their peak in late 2010. Building approvals had been flat in July, at levels well below average. Members noted that building activity had been significantly stronger in Victoria than in other states in recent years. ", " A range of other indicators also suggested that financial conditions were tighter than normal. Business credit had fallen over the past year, reflecting weak demand for credit, along with stringent lending standards for some sectors, particularly commercial property. The real exchange rate remained near its highest level in almost 35 years. ", " The unemployment rate had increased slightly to 5.1 per cent in July, while employment was unchanged. Employment growth had clearly slowed from the rapid pace seen in 2010, and forward-looking indicators such as job advertisements had eased. Furthermore, liaison suggested that a rising number of firms were re-assessing their hiring plans. Outside of industries exposed to the mining boom, firms were not experiencing significant difficulties hiring suitable workers. ", " The wage price index increased by 3.8 per cent over the year to the June quarter, which was a little above its average pace over the past decade and a half. However, private-sector wage growth was a little softer than expected in the quarter and public-sector wage growth had moderated over the past year. Nevertheless, measures of aggregate wage growth remained high relative to the slow rate of productivity growth, implying that unit labour costs were growing more quickly. ", " Members were briefed on staff expectations for the June quarter national accounts. Strong growth in engineering investment and a bounce-back in exports were expected to have contributed to strong growth in GDP in the quarter, following the weather-related disruptions to coal and iron ore exports in the March quarter. Looking ahead, the recovery in coal production in Queensland was proceeding gradually and was expected to continue to boost GDP growth through to early 2012. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The international outlook had become significantly more clouded since the previous Board meeting. Conditions in global financial markets had been very unsettled as participants had confronted uncertainty about both the resolution of sovereign debt problems and the prospects for economic growth in Europe and the United States. There was little evidence available to help gauge the effects of the European and US problems on other regions. However, prices for key Australian commodities had remained very high, with growth in China continuing to be solid. ", " Australia's terms of trade were around record high levels and national income had been growing strongly. A large pick-up in resources sector investment was under way and some related services sectors were enjoying better-than-average conditions. The broader economy was, however, softer than earlier expected, employment growth had slowed and confidence was lower. Cautious behaviour by households and the high level of the exchange rate were having a noticeable dampening effect on some sectors, while the impetus from the earlier fiscal stimulus was abating, as had been intended. It was increasingly apparent that the economy was going through a period of considerable structural change and that this was causing difficulties in a number of industries. Overall, the near-term growth outlook looked somewhat weaker than had been expected earlier, but the medium-term outlook still appeared positive, providing that the world economic outlook did not continue to deteriorate. ", " While measures of underlying inflation had, to date, remained consistent with the 2–3 per cent target on a year-ended basis, they had picked up from their lows and the Board in recent months had been concerned about the medium-term outlook for inflation, on the basis that ongoing strength in demand would, over time, lead to a pick-up in cost pressures. Evidence of slow productivity growth over recent years added to these concerns. ", " Financial indicators were generally consistent with monetary policy already exerting a degree of restraint. Credit growth was slow, asset prices had declined and the exchange rate was high. ", " A key question for members was the extent to which recent global and domestic developments would reduce capacity pressures in the economy and, in due course, help to contain inflation. Very little hard data were available, as yet, on which to base such judgements. As further information became available on the domestic and international economies, members would continue to assess the medium-term outlook for inflation and growth. For the present, however, members considered that the current setting of monetary policy left the Board well placed to respond to evolving global and domestic economic conditions.

Growth in Australia's major trading partners strengthened in the December quarter, despite a decline in activity in the advanced economies. ", " Indicators suggested that growth of the Chinese economy had stabilised at a sustainable pace, although activity data were limited over the past month and the available data were difficult to interpret owing to the Spring Festival holiday. The Chinese authorities had expressed some concerns about the pace of house price growth. Financial conditions in China remained accommodative, with strong growth in total financing over recent months, much of which had been from sources other than banks' balance sheets. Output growth in India had picked up somewhat from low rates. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia (excluding Japan), growth had been a little stronger recently and inflation had remained contained for the region as a whole. Japanese economic activity remained weak in the December quarter, but more timely data pointed to some improvement in early 2013, with both consumer and business sentiment rising following the Government's earlier announcement of more stimulus measures. ", " Members noted that the US economy appeared to have continued to grow moderately, with further improvement in the housing market, and continued growth in payrolls. The automatic government spending cuts came into force in full from 1 March, in contrast to most forecasters' earlier expectation that not all of the cuts would be implemented. ", " Economic activity in the euro area contracted further in the December quarter, with falls in output in Germany and France, and larger contractions in the economies most affected by sovereign debt problems. Although there had been some improvement in sentiment and activity over recent months, conditions were expected to remain weak, partly reflecting further fiscal consolidation over the balance of the year. ", " Prices for iron ore remained relatively high, although this strength was still expected to be temporary, in part because of an expected increase in supply. Spot prices for coking coal had picked up slightly, while rural and base metals prices were a little lower over the past month. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" With the national accounts scheduled for release the day after the Board meeting, members noted that information to hand at the meeting suggested that the pace of output growth in the December quarter had been around trend. Coal and iron ore exports had grown strongly in the quarter, and most components of domestic demand were estimated to have recorded moderate growth. ", " While mining investment was reported to have grown further in the December quarter, it still appeared that mining investment as a share of GDP was approaching its peak and mining firms remained focused on containing costs. The gradual shift away from investment towards production and exports in the period ahead was expected to lead to some reduction in the demand for labour in the resources sector. ", " Investment outside the mining sector was estimated to have declined in the December quarter. However, there were indications that it would pick up in 2013/14, although this was expected to be modest, as business surveys of investment intentions and capacity utilisation were at below-average levels and liaison suggested that some firms were investing only to cover depreciation. Consistent with this, non-residential building approvals remained low and office vacancy rates had risen over recent quarters, reflecting softening demand for office space. Members noted that business profits had declined a little and business debt had been growing at a moderate pace of about 4 per cent per annum. ", " Members observed that dwelling construction activity had picked up further in the December quarter. Forward-looking indicators such as building approvals pointed to further growth in construction in the months ahead. The increase in approvals had been geographically widespread and the Bank's liaison with builders also suggested there had been an improvement in buyer interest in some states. Overall, recent housing market developments pointed to a further moderate increase in dwelling construction in the period ahead. ", " Indicators of consumption had been mixed but, overall, growth appeared to have been only modest in the December quarter. The value of retail spending was unchanged over the December quarter, although figures released during the meeting indicated that spending had increased in January, which was consistent with liaison contacts reporting stronger retail spending in early 2013. Motor vehicle sales to households were flat in February but remained at a robust level, while measures of consumer sentiment had increased further over recent months, to be a bit above their long-run average levels. ", " Members noted that conditions in the labour market remained subdued. The unemployment rate in January was steady at 5.4 per cent, but the rate of growth of employment remained modest, the trend in total hours worked remained flat and the participation rate had declined a little further. While leading indicators of labour demand were down from earlier levels, they remained consistent with modest employment growth in the near term. ", " As expected, the year-ended pace of wage growth continued to slow, with the wage price index increasing by 3.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter. This slowing had been broad-based across states and industries, and was particularly pronounced in the household services and retail sectors. Information from liaison and business surveys was consistent with private sector wage growth on a quarterly basis remaining around current rates over the period ahead. "], "Financial Markets": [" After a relatively quiet period over previous months, volatility in financial markets had increased somewhat through February, amid greater political uncertainty in Europe, particularly in Italy. ", " Members noted that the expectation within financial markets remained that forthcoming changes to the Bank of Japan's executive would usher in a more aggressive policy stance. There was a further decline in the balance sheet of the European Central Bank as early repayments of its three-year lending operations continued, with Spanish and French banks accounting for a large part of the decline to date. ", " Government bond yields in major markets declined over February, with Japanese 10-year bond yields falling to their lowest level in around a decade. Bond yields in the United Kingdom also fell, notwithstanding a downgrading of the UK's sovereign credit rating by one of the rating agencies. In contrast, yields on Italian government bonds rose sharply immediately after the Italian election as the lack of a decisive result became clear, although there had been little change since. ", " After increasing significantly in earlier months, share prices in most major markets were little changed over the past month, although those in Italy fell sharply after the election. Members observed that the Australian share market had continued to rise, with corporate earnings in the current reporting season generally meeting expectations. Members noted that despite the large increases in share prices since the middle of last year, price-earnings ratios in most markets, including Australia, were around their long-run average levels. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the yen had depreciated a little further over the past month and the pound sterling had continued to depreciate, reflecting the recent run of weak economic data as well as the UK's sovereign credit downgrade. The Australian dollar was slightly lower against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis in February, but it remained at a high level. ", " Members observed that spreads on corporate debt generally remained low, following a significant contraction globally during the second half of 2012. Domestically, there had been a substantial volume of asset-backed debt issued during February, with spreads on residential mortgage-backed securities reaching their lowest levels since prior to the financial crisis. Funding conditions for Australian banks remained as favourable as they had been for some months. In time, this improved environment should see some moderation in banks' strong demand for deposits but, for the present, spreads between deposits and comparable wholesale benchmarks remained elevated. ", " The Board's decision to leave the stance of policy unchanged in February had been anticipated by financial markets. Members noted that current pricing implied that the market expected only a small chance of the cash rate being lowered at the March meeting. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " Internationally, risks to global financial stability had eased over the past six months as global financial market sentiment had improved significantly. This mainly reflected various policy developments in Europe, which had increasingly demonstrated a strong commitment on the part of the European authorities to deal with their sovereign debt and banking sector problems while maintaining the monetary union. Also boosting confidence had been the partial resolution of the US ‘fiscal cliff’ around the end of the year and further signs of recovery in some of the major economies. ", " Overall, members noted that the improvement in sentiment had led to more favourable conditions in funding markets in the major economies (and Australia), although they recognised that the euro area, in particular, still faced significant stability challenges from its fiscal and banking sector problems. Therefore, it was too early to say whether the improved market sentiment was the beginning of a sustained recovery, or merely a temporary upswing. ", " Members observed developments in a number of broad indicators for commercial banks in several countries and regions – covering variables such as share prices, profits and indicators of asset quality – which showed that banks in Australia and Canada, as well as in several Asian economies, continued to perform more strongly than those in the United States, Europe and Japan. Members discussed the possible risks emanating from a change in behaviour of banks in the low credit growth environment. ", " The Australian banks, in particular, had continued to record strong profitability in recent periods, which had helped them to strengthen their capital positions further. Wholesale funding cost pressures on the banks had, at the margin, eased with the improved global market sentiment. This would take some time to be reflected in average costs. Banks' asset performance had also been improving, though at a gradual pace owing to the challenging conditions being experienced in some parts of the Australian business sector. ", " Both household and business borrowing had been relatively restrained over the recent period. Members noted that households' net wealth had risen recently with the recovery in asset markets and continued high saving rates and borrowing restraint. Debt-servicing capacity had also been boosted by lower interest rates, which had helped to keep housing loan arrears and other aggregate measures of financial stress low, despite the unemployment rate recording a modest rise over the past year. Over the same time, aggregate business profitability had fallen – particularly in the mining sector – and business failure rates had increased somewhat under the influence of a high exchange rate and a return to more traditional saving and borrowing behaviour by households over recent years. Overall, though, gearing ratios were low and deleveraging was continuing in some sectors. ", " Members were updated on the current state of international regulatory reforms, where the focus was now shifting to implementation of the agreed reforms at the national level (particularly the Basel III capital standards) and monitoring the consistency of implementation internationally through various assessments and peer reviews. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Global economic conditions continued to be more positive than they had been for much of 2012. Growth had stabilised in China at what appeared to be a sustainable pace, while picking up in the rest of Asia (excluding Japan) and recording a moderate pace in the US economy. Conditions in Japan and the euro area had been particularly weak in the second half of 2012, although some recent indicators had been a little more positive. Risks to the global outlook appeared more balanced than they had been in the previous year, although vulnerabilities remained, particularly in Europe. ", " Global financial market conditions remained very accommodative, with expansionary monetary policies contributing to rising asset prices over recent months. In Australia, asset prices were also rising, although household and business debt continued to grow at a moderate pace. The response of financial markets to political developments in the United States and Europe had been muted over the past month. ", " The available partial indicators suggested that the Australian economy grew at close to trend pace over the year to the December quarter. While mining investment had made a further contribution to growth, it appeared to be approaching its peak. Survey-based measures of business conditions were below average and non-mining business investment had, to date, remained subdued. That was likely to continue in the near term, but recent data suggested a modest increase in non-mining business investment was in prospect during 2013/14. There were signs that dwelling investment was growing and it was likely to continue to do so at a moderate pace in the period ahead, and exports were strengthening. Overall, the staff's assessment remained that GDP growth would be a little below trend this year, with a pick-up after that. ", " Members noted that further moderation in the year-ended growth of wages, evident in recent data, was consistent with the staff forecast of inflation remaining around the middle of the target. Given that the effect of the earlier exchange rate appreciation had waned, the inflation forecast assumed a combination of ongoing productivity growth and wage growth remaining around the more moderate pace seen in recent quarters. The latter was consistent with the softer conditions in the labour market evident since mid 2012. ", " Given the economic outlook, the Board considered it appropriate that the stance of monetary policy should be accommodative. After six cash rate reductions since late 2011, lending rates were close to the historically low levels of 2009 and clearly below normal levels. Interest-sensitive parts of the economy continued to show signs of responding to these low rates and it was likely that this still had further to run, though the exchange rate remained high. With inflation likely to remain around the middle of the inflation target, members judged that there would be scope to cut the cash rate further to support demand, should that be necessary. At this meeting, the Board's assessment was that, while further reductions may be required, on the information currently to hand it was appropriate to hold rates steady, and to assess further developments over the period ahead.

Members noted that Europe remained the main focus, reflecting market concerns about the possibility of a Greek default as well as the stability of the European banking system. These concerns had been accentuated by broader worries about the global economic outlook. ", " Members noted that European governments were currently voting on an expanded European sovereign support vehicle, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). To date, more than half the EU governments, including Germany, had approved the new structure of the EFSF. Discussions were ongoing as to whether the facility should be enlarged, how this could occur, and the purposes to which it could be put; these included using some funds to recapitalise European banks. ", " The pressure on European banks had intensified during this period, particularly French banks. The cost of US dollar funding for all European banks had risen significantly, leading the major central banks to extend US dollar swap lines to a three-month maturity. ", " Reflecting these developments, share prices of financial institutions, particularly those in Europe, had fallen significantly and had been extremely volatile. At one stage, the share prices of the three largest French banks had fallen by more than 30 per cent in the month, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">75–90 per cent</span> below their pre-crisis levels. Along with the heightened concerns about the global growth outlook, this had caused share prices globally to fall by nearly 10 per cent over the past month. ", " There had been a substantial reversal of the earlier strong capital inflows into emerging markets, which also drove down share prices in these economies. This reversal of capital flows had been reflected in large depreciations of emerging market currencies against the US dollar. The repatriated funds mainly went into the United States, particularly into US Treasury securities. ", " These forces were also at work in Australian financial markets, with the result that movements in the Australian dollar in September again became more highly correlated with movements in global equity prices, in contrast to the experience in earlier months. The Australian dollar traded in a large range over the past month, from a high of almost US$1.08 to a low of US$0.94. Notwithstanding this volatility, liquidity in the market had generally been reasonable. ", " Early in September, the Swiss National Bank announced that it had instituted a ceiling on the Swiss franc against the euro, at an already high level, to counter the rapid appreciation of the franc that had resulted from large safe-haven flows. The Swiss franc had subsequently traded somewhat below the ceiling. ", " During the month, the Federal Reserve had announced that it would increase the average maturity of its holdings of US Treasuries in order to reduce longer-term government yields, and thereby borrowing costs for US households and businesses. The initial effect of the Fed's announcement, together with the strong inflows into Treasuries because of the heightened risk aversion noted previously, had been a decline in 10-year Treasury yields to historic lows of around 1¾ per cent. Other interest rates, including the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate, had also declined, although members noted that the impact of that had been curtailed by tighter lending standards applied by lending institutions since the financial crisis and the limited amount of housing equity available to be withdrawn. ", " Members were briefed on the growing market expectations of an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) at its next meeting, to be held later in the week, together with the expectation that the ECB would announce further liquidity support to European banks. The ECB had continued its purchases of government debt to contain the rise in Italian and Spanish government bond yields, although the amount of its weekly purchases had declined recently. In other monetary policy developments, the Bank of England had indicated that it was contemplating further quantitative easing. ", " In the Australian markets, there was an expectation that the cash rate would be reduced significantly by the middle of next year, which was reflected in lower yields on comparable government paper and bank bills. ", " There had been very little bond issuance globally or locally over the past month given the heightened volatility. Nevertheless, the domestic banks remained well positioned to withstand a further period of dislocation, with deposit growth continuing to outpace lending growth. The Australian banks continued to have good access to short-term markets onshore and offshore. There had also been a reasonably sized issue of mortgage-backed securities. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members had limited information with which to assess the impact of the recent financial turbulence on the global economy. They noted, however, that business and consumer surveys had showed a sharp drop in confidence in the North Atlantic economies in August, with confidence remaining low in September. Survey measures of business conditions in the United States had strengthened slightly in September after large falls in August. While comparisons with late 2008 were inevitable, members noted that information available so far suggested a number of differences relative to that episode. Even though there was evidence that momentum in the global economy had slowed before the recent turbulence, growth in mid 2011 had been stronger than it was in mid 2008 in the lead-up to the global recession. In addition, there were no indications of a tightening in trade credit to date, again in contrast to the situation in late 2008. ", " The downside risks from developments in financial markets had been the main focus of the IMF's recently published <em>World Economic Outlook</em>, which had reported that the global economy was in a ‘dangerous new phase’ and that downside risks to activity had increased noticeably. Notwithstanding this assessment, the IMF's central forecast for the global economy was for growth of 4 per cent in both 2011 and 2012. While these forecasts were lower than those published in June, if achieved, they would represent around trend growth in the world economy, though it was possible the outlook would be downgraded further. Growth in most of Asia was expected to remain relatively solid, but growth was expected to be fairly subdued in many of the advanced economies, with unemployment likely to remain high. ", " In the United States, the economic data remained soft, although consistent with an economy that was still expanding. Industrial production and orders of core capital goods had risen in August, while retail spending was flat, partly reflecting the impact of Hurricane Irene. The labour market remained weak, with little net job creation over recent months. Given the deterioration in the outlook for the economy, President Obama had proposed a fiscal stimulus equivalent to 3 per cent of GDP, which would be offset by tightening measures spread over the medium term. ", " The euro area economy had clearly slowed and little growth was expected over the remainder of the year. While exports had contributed to growth, fiscal policy was being tightened and household consumption had been weak. Unemployment in the region remained at 10 per cent, though rates varied considerably across countries. Fiscal outcomes were also diverging, with the latest IMF forecasts showing a significant upward revision to the expected debt/GDP ratio in Greece, which was now forecast to rise to around 190 per cent partly as a result of the weaker economy. In contrast, the expected path of the debt/GDP ratio had been revised down slightly for Ireland. ", " In emerging Asia, growth remained solid, although slower than in 2010. In China, growth in fixed asset investment and consumption had softened a little, as had survey measures of business conditions in manufacturing, with members noting that the availability of finance to certain industries was quite tight. However, the broader economy still appeared to be expanding at a robust pace, with industrial production growing by 13 per cent over the latest year and continued growth in exports to advanced economies. Year-ended inflation had declined a little to 6.2 per cent, largely due to slower growth in food prices. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, indications were that domestic demand continued to grow strongly, although industrial production had been flat and global demand for electronics had softened over recent months. Notwithstanding the problems in the North Atlantic economies, the available measures suggested consumer and business confidence had remained at high levels across the region. ", " The global uncertainty had been accompanied by falls in the prices of exchange-traded commodities, with prices of base metals falling by 15–25 per cent over the previous two months. The price of oil in Asia had fallen by around 7 per cent, while gold and silver prices had fallen sharply, after a very large run-up over the previous year or so. In contrast, bulk commodity prices had remained at high levels, with spot prices down only a little over the previous month. Australia's terms of trade were estimated to have been at a record high in the September quarter, but were still expected to decline somewhat in the period ahead as global prices for Australia's main resource exports eased in response to softening demand in some economies and a rise in the global supply of commodities. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" In Australia, economic conditions continued to vary significantly across sectors, which was complicating the task of assessing the strength of the overall economy. ", " The national accounts for the June quarter were released the day after the September Board meeting. They showed an increase in GDP of 1.2 per cent in the June quarter after a fall of 0.9 per cent in the March quarter (previously reported as a fall of 1.2 per cent); over the year, GDP increased by 1.4 per cent. Private demand was continuing to grow at a slightly above-trend pace owing to strong investment in the resources sector. This was being partly offset by weak growth in public demand as the fiscal stimulus was being unwound, and by strong growth in imports, particularly of capital goods. GDP outcomes continued to be affected by the disruption to coal production caused by the floods at the beginning of the year, with a full recovery still not expected until early 2012. ", " The national accounts confirmed that growth in household spending on goods had been quite modest, while growth in spending on services had been strong. Overall, consumption increased by 1 per cent in the June quarter, to be 3.2 per cent higher over the year. While there were no new data from the ABS on retail sales, the staff estimated that the volume of imports of consumption goods had risen solidly in August. The Bank's liaison with retailers suggested there was a fall in spending in early August because of the market turmoil, with this fall reversed in late August and into September. Overall, retailers continued to report subdued conditions. Consumer confidence remained low, although part of the large decline in July and August had been reversed in September. ", " Indicators of business conditions had been mixed. In the mining sector, the pipeline of investment remained very strong, with another large project (the $29 billion Wheatstone LNG project) receiving final investment approval during September. This brought the value of LNG projects announced so far in 2011 to around $70 billion. More broadly, the NAB measure of current business conditions declined in August to be a little below its long-run average level. Conditions remained weak in the manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail sectors, but stronger in the mining, transport, and recreation and personal services sectors. As had been the case elsewhere around the world, business confidence had fallen noticeably and growth in business credit remained weak. ", " The housing market remained subdued, with housing prices having fallen by 3 per cent over the year to August. The REIA measure of the national rental vacancy rate had edged up in the June quarter, with increases in all cities except Perth, although the national vacancy rate remained below the long-term average rate. Members noted an increase in the vacancy rate in Melbourne, where there had been strong growth in apartment building and a slowing in population growth, in part because of falls in the number of foreign students. Growth in housing credit remained subdued, with annualised growth of around 5 per cent in the three months to August. ", " Recent data for the labour market were mixed, but on balance pointed to a softening in the labour market. After an extended period when it had remained steady at around 5 per cent, the unemployment rate had increased for the second consecutive month in August, to 5.3 per cent, with the number of people employed estimated to have fallen in August. Notwithstanding the pick-up in the unemployment rate, the vacancy rate had risen over the three months to August. Furthermore, in contrast to the pick-up in the estimated unemployment rate, the number of unemployment benefit recipients had continued to fall. Data on employment growth by industry showed growth over the past year had been strong in a range of business and household services industries, as well as in mining, construction and public administration, while employment had fallen in agriculture and manufacturing. Outside the resources sector, there were few reports of labour shortages and liaison suggested that the upward pressure on wages was tending to ease. ", " Members were briefed on the revisions to measures of underlying inflation, following a review by the ABS of the seasonality of components of the CPI. These revised measures showed recent outcomes for underlying inflation lower than those previously published. An example was the trimmed mean measure of underlying inflation for the June quarter, which was lowered from 0.9 per cent to 0.7 per cent, bringing the year-ended rate down from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent (though underlying inflation looked slightly higher in history). ", " The ABS had also updated the expenditure weights in the CPI for the first time in six years, with the new weights to be applied from the September quarter release. The reweighting took account of changing expenditure patterns, including consumers tending to switch their expenditure towards goods and services whose relative prices had fallen (for example, audio, visual &amp; computing equipment). One other significant change was the exclusion of the interest margin measure in the ‘deposit &amp; loan facilities’ category, which had been a source of volatility in inflation outcomes over recent years. If the new weights and seasonal factors had been in operation over the past year, the outcomes for inflation would have been lower than those published earlier. In particular, the staff estimated that underlying inflation over the year to the June quarter would have been 2¼–2½ per cent, rather than 2½ –2¾ per cent. ", " Members discussed the implications of recent developments for the economic outlook. Based on economic and financial developments over the preceding two months, it was likely that growth over the forecast period would be somewhat slower and that the labour market would be less tight than forecast at the time of the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. This prospect, as well as the lower starting point for inflation, meant that the inflation outlook appeared less concerning than was the case a few months ago. The inflation outlook would be reviewed after receipt of the next round of data on prices ahead of the November meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Conditions in global financial markets had continued to be very unsettled, with uncertainty increasing about both the prospects for resolution of the sovereign debt and banking problems in Europe and the outlook for global economic growth. This had been reflected in falls in measures of consumer and business confidence in the major economies, and it was likely to weigh on spending and growth in these economies. This could spread to other regions, but so far indications were that economic activity was continuing to expand in China and other parts of Asia. Overall, recent events had led forecasters to reduce their estimates for global GDP growth. Prices for commodities had also declined over recent weeks, although they remained relatively high. ", " Domestically, there continued to be large differences in conditions across sectors. Investment in the resources sector was picking up very strongly and some related services sectors were experiencing better-than-average conditions. In other sectors, cautious behaviour by households and the earlier rise in the exchange rate were having a noticeable dampening effect. The impetus from earlier Australian Government spending programs was also abating, as had been intended. While there remained good reasons to expect solid growth over the medium term, indications were that the pace of near-term growth was unlikely to be as strong as earlier expected, reflecting both local and global factors, including the financial turmoil and associated effects on business confidence. With labour market conditions now a little softer, the likelihood of a significant acceleration in aggregate labour costs was lessening. These developments, together with new data showing that the pick-up in underlying inflation had been more gradual than initially indicated, suggested that the medium-term inflation outlook may now be more consistent with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> target. Further data on inflation would be available later in the month. ", " Members believed that an improved inflation outlook, if confirmed by further data, would increase the scope for monetary policy to provide some support to demand, should that prove necessary. Members noted that financial conditions had already eased somewhat, with interest rates for some housing and business loans declining slightly because of increased competition and the fall in funding costs in financial markets. The exchange rate had also declined somewhat from the very high levels of a few months ago. ", " Taking all these factors into account, members considered that the existing stance of policy remained appropriate. That assessment would be reviewed based on developments in international financial markets and on further data on economic activity and prices ahead of the Board's next meeting.

As optimism increased about the prospects for resolving Europe's current financial problems, many asset prices had recovered from their lows at the time of the previous Board meeting. The announcement of measures to support market liquidity in the euro area and better-than-expected economic data in the United States also helped to improve market sentiment. ", " Members noted that the changes to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) proposed in mid 2011 had now been approved by all euro area countries. The approved facility had a lending capacity of €440 billion (some of which had already been committed). Subsequently, European policymakers had proposed several further measures to help restore confidence in European sovereign debt and banking systems, including a larger haircut on private-sector holdings of Greek debt, a substantial recapitalisation of European banks and an increase in the effective size of the EFSF to around €1 trillion through some form of leverage, though the details had not been finalised. ", " Share markets in the United States and the major European countries had risen by more than 10 per cent over the month. Bank share prices had also recovered strongly (except in Europe), notwithstanding the mostly lacklustre third-quarter results for the large global banks. The share prices for Australian banks had generally outperformed banks from other countries; all three of the major banks that were scheduled to report their annual reports by early November were expected to deliver strong results. ", " The improved sentiment in financial markets also saw government bond yields in the major advanced economies rise from their historic lows reached a month earlier. However, spreads on Italian sovereign bonds had widened significantly, as had those on French bonds, with the latter partly reflecting concerns about the fiscal costs of resolving Dexia. ", " Short-term funding costs for European banks remained relatively high and the market for unsecured borrowing in euros was effectively closed for some borrowers. This led the European Central Bank (ECB) to announce that it would provide unlimited funding to European banks at its policy rate for 12- and 13-month terms (against eligible collateral), thereby circumventing the strained interbank market. Overall, ECB lending to European banks had increased by around 40 per cent in the previous six months. Members observed that, together with the US dollar swap lines in place, these facilities should help ease funding pressures on European banks. ", " Members were informed that foreign exchange markets had remained volatile. The euro, Australian dollar and many other currencies traded in a wide range against the US dollar, with the Australian dollar moving through a 14 cent range over the month. In contrast, the Japanese yen had traded in a very narrow range against the US dollar until late in the month, when the yen reached a new high on 31 October, in nominal terms, thereby triggering aggressive intervention by the Japanese authorities and an immediate fall in the yen of around 5 per cent. ", " In monetary policy developments, the Bank of England announced that it would ease policy by conducting further quantitative easing in the form of purchases of UK government debt. Authorities in a number of emerging market countries had also eased policy over the past month, including in Brazil, Indonesia and Singapore, although the Reserve Bank of India had continued to tighten policy to stem inflation. ", " In Australia, there remained an expectation in financial markets that the policy rate would be reduced at this meeting. Beyond that, however, markets now expected that the policy rate would not be reduced as much as previously had been expected. Members noted that some fixed-term lending rates had been reduced, reflecting the decline in market rates. ", " Members were informed that while the total amount of bonds issued globally had been subdued over the past month, Australian banks had been able to conduct a number of unsecured bond raisings and had also issued mortgage-backed securities. In addition, they continued to access short-term markets onshore and offshore with comfort. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Since the previous Board meeting, the economic data for the United States had been a little stronger than in earlier months, while the data for Europe had continued to soften. Consumer and business confidence generally remained quite low in most of the advanced economies. ", " Growth in Asia had remained solid, although it had moderated following the general tightening in macroeconomic policies over the past year, and there were also some early signs that the slowing in some of the advanced economies was having an impact in the region. The effects were most evident in exports, with the value of east Asian exports to the United States and the European Union broadly unchanged over the previous half year. Global demand for electronic goods had softened and, outside of China, there had been little growth in industrial production recently. Members noted that floods were having a significant effect on production in Thailand and that, in some industries, this was expected to flow on to production in other countries in the region. Notwithstanding the slowing in trade, growth in domestic demand across the region remained generally firm and the volatility in global financial markets did not appear to have had any noticeable effect on the availability of trade finance. There had been some easing of near-term inflation pressures across the region as a result of the recent declines in commodity prices, although inflation rates generally remained relatively high. ", " In China, the economy had grown at a solid 2.3 per cent pace in the September quarter and by 9.1 per cent over the year. While the annual rate was down from the unsustainably high pace coming out of the global recession, members noted that the authorities had been seeking some slowing, given the increase in inflation. Consistent with developments elsewhere in the region, growth in exports looked to have slowed, as had growth in investment. Credit conditions facing some sectors were very tight, most notably in the property market. In contrast, other sectors continued to grow very strongly, with, for example, sales of cars and household appliances recording large increases over recent months. Inflation looked to have peaked, with the year-ended rate edging down in September. ", " Recent data for the United States, including for the labour market, had shown a more positive tone than was the case around mid year. The initial estimate showed GDP growth of 0.6 per cent in the September quarter and 1.6 per cent over the year, suggesting that the marked slowing in the first half of the year was partly the result of temporary factors, including the increase in the price of oil and the effect of the Japanese earthquake. With corporate sector balance sheets in good shape, business investment had grown strongly in the September quarter and by 9 per cent over the year, and growth in capital goods orders had remained strong. Notwithstanding the recent falls in consumer confidence to very low levels, the growth rate of household consumption spending had picked up a little in the quarter, with the saving rate falling. However, public expenditure was 2½ per cent lower over the year, and members noted that the United States faced its own significant fiscal challenges. ", " In the euro area, conditions remained very subdued, with consumer and business confidence having fallen in recent months. The unemployment rate had risen by 0.1 percentage points to 10.2 per cent in September. Growth appeared to have slowed in Germany and France, the two countries that had driven the European recovery since 2009. The OECD had recently revised its 2012 euro area GDP growth forecast down from 2 per cent to just 0.3 per cent. Credit conditions appeared to be tightening, reflecting the problems in the European banking system, and members noted the very large fiscal adjustment facing many countries. ", " The prices of most exchange-traded commodities had increased a little over the past month, after sharp falls in August and September. However, the prices for iron ore had recently fallen sharply, after initial resilience relative to other commodity prices. Since its recent peak in September, the spot price in China had fallen by more than 30 per cent. Members noted that the global supply of iron ore had increased at a time when European demand had declined. In addition, while the official data for crude steel production in China had remained strong up to September, available data for October had shown a fall in production. Reflecting developments in commodity markets, Australia's terms of trade were likely to have peaked in the September quarter. The forecast for the terms of trade had been revised down, in line with the steep declines in iron ore prices, but the terms of trade were still expected to remain at very high levels. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The main economic news in the month had been the release of the CPI data for the September quarter. In underlying terms, inflation was lower than had been expected, with the various measures showing inflation of 0.3–0.5 per cent in the quarter. On a year-ended basis, underlying inflation was running at a little below 2½ per cent, the midpoint of the medium-term target. Headline inflation was 0.6 per cent in the quarter, or 0.4 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis. The year-ended CPI inflation rate, at 3.5 per cent, was still being boosted by the large rise in fruit and fuel prices earlier in the year. As expected, there was a large rise in the price of utilities in the quarter, with this being offset by a decline in housing construction costs and a seasonal decline in pharmaceutical prices. The prices of tradable goods had fallen slightly in the quarter, after more significant falls around the turn of the year, which suggested that the effects of the earlier exchange rate appreciation were waning. Excluding the effects of fruit and vegetable prices, food price inflation had remained subdued. ", " Taken together, the information on inflation over the past two months suggested that there was less inflationary pressure in the economy than had been expected earlier in the year. While it remained possible that this was just the result of noise in the data, it was consistent with the softer growth in the non-mining economy and liaison reports that many firms felt that they had limited pricing power. ", " The recent data on economic activity had been a little more positive than in the previous couple of months, although conditions remained subdued in a number of sectors. ", " The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.2 per cent in September, after having risen by 0.4 percentage points over July and August. In the month, employment increased by around 20,000, although there had been little net employment growth over the past six months. Other indicators also pointed to a softening in the labour market over the course of 2011, with the Bank's liaison suggesting that firms were waiting to see evidence of stronger demand before hiring additional workers. ", " The retail trade data for July and August had also been stronger than in previous months. Members noted that there were divergent trends in retail sales, with weakness in the categories of department stores, household goods and clothing, footwear &amp; accessories, but more strength in a range of categories such as food, cafes &amp; restaurants, and other retailers. Survey measures of consumer confidence remained below average, despite some improvement in September and October. ", " The housing market remained subdued, with preliminary estimates suggesting another small decline in nationwide prices in September, to be around 3–4 per cent lower over the year. Growth in housing credit continued to run a little below growth in disposable income. There had been a noticeable pick-up in building approvals in August owing to a large rise in the apartments category, although this could be volatile from month to month. ", " Data for September indicated that growth in business credit remained subdued, although a little stronger than a few months earlier. Survey-based measures of business conditions were mostly around long-run average levels but conditions continued to vary significantly across industries. In September, business confidence had improved after the sharp fall in August, but it was still well below average. Conditions in parts of the construction sector remained quite soft. In contrast, conditions in the resources sector were very positive and, consistent with this, there has been strong growth in imports of capital goods. Iron ore exports had risen strongly over recent months, but the recovery in coal exports continued to be slower than earlier expected because of difficulties in removing water from flooded mines. Information from the Bureau of Meteorology suggested a growing risk of a wetter-than-usual summer, which could further delay the recovery in coal production. ", " The staff had undertaken a review of the forecasts ahead of publication of the November <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. The forecasts for domestic growth had been revised lower reflecting the weaker global outlook, the decline in confidence and asset prices since August, and a downward revision to the outlook for coal production. Over the forecast period, domestic demand was expected to grow at an annual rate of around 4 per cent, with growth in imports substantially faster than this, owing to both the high exchange rate and the mining sector's relatively greater use of imported capital goods. Overall GDP growth was expected to be around 3–3½ per cent in 2012 and a little stronger in 2013. Correspondingly, the unemployment rate was expected to increase a little, before drifting lower again. ", " The outlook for the resources sector remained very strong, with mining investment expected to increase to around 7 per cent of GDP by 2013/14. In contrast, growth in the non-mining economy was expected to be below trend. The household saving rate was forecast to remain around its current level and growth in public demand was expected to be subdued. The sovereign debt problems in the euro area posed the most significant risk to the growth outlook. ", " The inflation forecasts had also been lowered, reflecting both the lower starting point and the modest downward revision to the forecast for output growth. Based on the current set of assumptions, inflation in underlying terms (excluding the effect of the carbon price) was expected to be around 2½ per cent in 2012, and to pick up a little in 2013, but still be consistent with the inflation target. This general outlook for inflation was conditional on aggregate wages growth remaining at around its current pace and a pick-up in productivity growth. The year-ended rate of CPI inflation was expected to fall below underlying inflation in early 2012, as banana prices fell to more normal levels. It was then expected to increase to around 3¼ per cent following the introduction of the price on carbon in mid 2012, before again declining. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Recent information suggested a moderation in the pace of global growth compared with expectations earlier in the year. The US economy had picked up pace in the third quarter, but growth remained moderate and there was still significant spare capacity. The Chinese economy had slowed modestly, as the authorities there had intended, and inflation looked like it had peaked. Around the Asian region, output had recovered from the effects of the Japanese earthquake and domestic demand appeared to be still expanding at a good pace, but there were some early signs that exports to Europe had weakened. Commodity prices had generally declined over recent months. ", " European policymakers had made progress in their response to the sovereign debt and banking problems over the past month. This had been reflected in a more optimistic tone in financial markets compared with the previous meeting. But there were as yet many details to be confirmed as to how the various elements of the package would work. It was likely that economic conditions in Europe would weaken further over the period ahead, given the effects of the recent turmoil on confidence, likely tightness of credit supply and the need for further fiscal consolidation. As a result, the risks to the global economy still seemed to lie predominantly on the downside, notwithstanding the positive initial reception of the recent announcements. ", " Members considered the significance of the inflation data that had become available over the past month. While revisions had altered the earlier quarterly profile somewhat, the latest data suggested that after a pick-up in underlying inflation in the first half of the year, there had been a moderation more recently, notwithstanding ongoing large increases in utilities charges. CPI inflation had remained above 3 per cent on a year-ended basis, but was expected to decline significantly over the next few quarters, as prices fell for some key food products that had been affected by adverse weather earlier in the year. ", " Information on economic activity suggested that the pace of growth in demand and output outside the resources and related sectors was a little lower than had been expected earlier in the year. The revised staff forecasts pointed to the likelihood of overall GDP growth being close to trend over the next one to two years, and inflation being consistent with the 2–3 per cent target. ", " Financial conditions had already been easing somewhat, with a range of lending rates edging down over the past couple of months. Nonetheless, with overall credit growth remaining low, financial conditions on balance appeared to remain somewhat tighter than normal. ", " Members discussed whether the improved picture for inflation meant that it was no longer necessary to maintain the slightly restrictive stance of monetary policy that had been in place over the past year. A case could be made for leaving rates unchanged on the basis that, unless the world economy turned down in a serious way, the expansionary effects of the high terms of trade and the associated investment build-up would, in time, assert themselves more fully, even though recent conditions had been softer than expected. In that event, policy settings on the tight side of normal would be appropriate over the medium term. In the meantime, the expectation that policy might be eased was itself being reflected in a reduced level of market interest rates. ", " The case for an easing in policy was that there had clearly been material changes to the recent course of, and outlook for, underlying inflation over recent months, while the downside risks for the global economy had increased. While the financial conditions that had been in place over the past year had helped contain inflation pressures in the economy, with the change in outlook that stance was no longer necessary. A more neutral setting would, on this view, be compatible with achieving sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target over the period ahead. ", " On balance, members concluded that it was appropriate for there to be a modest easing in the stance of monetary policy.

This was consistent with expectations of a gradual pick-up in the growth of global economic activity following the weakness seen in the September quarter 2012. Overall, growth was forecast to be around or a little above its long-term average over the next two years, with a strong contribution from faster-growing Asian economies. ", " A wide range of indicators showed that growth in the Chinese economy had stabilised, underpinned by public spending and somewhat stimulatory financial policies, which had boosted investment in infrastructure and housing. This had provided some additional support for demand for commodities and also for activity in east Asia (excluding Japan), where growth had remained a little below the average of the past decade. There had also been indications of stronger growth of domestic demand in the region. Members noted that activity in Japan remained weak, although the new government had announced plans to stimulate domestic economic activity and combat deflation. ", " In the United States, the full extent of the large fiscal consolidation that had been legislated to commence at the beginning of 2013 had been avoided. The resolution was, however, only partial and temporary, with several key decisions delayed. National accounts data implied no growth in the US economy overall in the December quarter, reflecting some one-off factors, but most other recent economic indicators had been broadly positive. ", " The euro area economy looked weaker and was estimated to have contracted again in the December quarter, notwithstanding a slight improvement in economic conditions and sentiment late in the quarter. Earlier policy announcements had contributed to a period of financial market stability, but the structural problems facing a number of countries were significant and would take time to resolve. ", " Members observed that iron ore prices had increased significantly over the past two months, largely reflecting stronger demand from China owing to increased industrial activity there as well as some rebuilding of iron ore stocks after earlier depleting inventories. However, iron ore prices had run well ahead of Chinese steel prices in recent months and it was widely expected that iron ore prices would not be sustained at these high levels. More generally, the improved global outlook had led to higher spot prices for many metals, coal and crude oil over recent months, but coal prices remained well below levels of a year earlier. Overall, the terms of trade were around 17 per cent below their late 2011 peak and the forecast profile was little changed.  "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members recalled that the national accounts, which had been released the day after the December Board meeting, showed that the Australian economy grew by 3.1 per cent over the year to the September quarter, which was around trend pace. Growth in the September quarter at 0.5 per cent was a bit slower than trend, with public demand declining – consistent with the fiscal consolidation that was occurring – while growth in consumption slowed somewhat following very strong growth earlier in the year. In contrast, mining investment rose strongly in the quarter and was still expected to peak sometime over the next few quarters, with information generally suggesting that the outlook for mining investment had not substantially changed despite the recent increase in iron ore prices. ", " More timely information pointed to growth in economic activity having picked up in the December quarter, with a significant contribution coming from exports. Against that, members noted that surveys of business conditions remained below average for most industries. While conditions remained soft in the construction industry, there were some signs that the housing market had firmed, partly due to the series of interest rate reductions over 2012. Notwithstanding month-to-month volatility, building approvals had increased since the middle of 2012, particularly in states other than Victoria, and prices and rental yields in the established housing market had also picked up. ", " Members were briefed that resource exports were estimated to have increased strongly in the December quarter, including coal exports following the end of a significant industrial dispute. The recent heavy rainfall in Queensland was likely to have a noticeable impact on the transport of coal to ports, but at the time of the meeting it appeared that the effect on exports would be much less pronounced than was the case in 2011. The heavy rainfall and flooding had also affected some agricultural areas. ", " Household consumption in the September quarter had slowed from the rapid pace seen in the first half of 2012. Information available at the time of the meeting, including from liaison, suggested that growth in the December quarter may have picked up a little, although conditions varied for different types of retailers. Over the same period, sales of motor vehicles had risen strongly. Measures of consumer confidence were at, or even a little above, long-run average levels. ", " Household income growth had slowed, in line with the weaker labour market. The unemployment rate had drifted up gradually over 2012, to be 5.4 per cent in December. Members noted that, over the same period, the labour force participation rate had declined a little and average hours worked were a little lower. Total employment had grown moderately in the second half of 2012, despite some decline in employment in mining and business services. Job vacancies and other forward-looking indicators had continued to soften, but remained consistent with modest employment growth in the months ahead. ", " CPI inflation was 0.5 per cent in the December quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis, following 1.2 per cent in the previous quarter, which had been boosted by the introduction of the carbon price and means testing of private health insurance rebates. The various measures suggested that underlying inflation was about ½ per cent in the December quarter. This followed a slightly higher-than-expected outcome three months earlier. Year-ended underlying inflation had remained around 2¼ per cent since the middle of 2012. Consistent with earlier expectations, the effect of the introduction of the carbon price on these measures appeared to be modest. ", " Prices of tradable items declined in the December quarter. Members noted that prices of consumer durables declined in recent quarters by more than would have been implied by the historical relationship between these prices and the exchange rate, perhaps reflecting the effect of ongoing competitive pressures. Abstracting from the one-off policy changes in the September quarter, non-tradables inflation appeared to have edged a little higher. This was largely attributed to higher prices for a range of market services, including financial services, insurance, telecommunications and domestic holiday travel &amp; accommodation. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. GDP growth was expected to be a bit below trend at around 2½ per cent over 2013 before picking up a little over the course of 2014. The forecasts had been revised down slightly, largely reflecting information that accumulated late last year suggesting a softer outlook for mining and non-mining investment. The forecast for growth over the next year or so incorporated several factors, notably the likelihood that the mining investment boom would reach its peak, the effect of both fiscal consolidation and the persistently high level of the Australian dollar, and few indications of an impending pick-up in non-mining business investment at this stage. At the same time, improving conditions in the housing market were expected to continue to provide support to dwelling investment, while non-mining business investment was expected to pick up gradually over time. ", " The slightly softer outlook for economic activity overall was expected to affect the labour market. Employment growth was forecast to remain modest over the course of the next year, before rising gradually towards the end of the forecast period. ", " The near-term outlook for inflation was a little lower than previously, reflecting the lower starting point implied by the December quarter CPI data and the softer outlook for activity and employment. In year-ended terms, the rate of underlying inflation was expected to be around 2½ per cent over the coming few quarters and then remain around the middle of the target for the rest of the forecast period. This was predicated on a further gradual slowing in the growth rate of wages combined with a higher rate of productivity growth compared with the slow pace seen over the 2000s.  "], "Financial Markets": [" Conditions in financial markets had continued to improve over the past couple of months, with sentiment supported by the partial resolution of the fiscal situation in the United States, approval of the revised Greek bailout package in December, policy developments in Japan and generally better-than-expected economic data globally. Members observed that there had been a marked decline in volatility in financial markets since mid 2012, as the perceived risk of extremely adverse outcomes had declined, accompanied by expectations that further policy actions would be taken if and wherever required. These favourable developments had resulted in a portfolio reallocation since the start of 2013, with an increasing number of investors who had adopted a conservative strategy during the second half of 2012 having shifted funds into higher-yielding assets, including the share market. ", " Central banks in the major advanced economies had undertaken a range of policy actions in the past two months. In Japan, the new Prime Minister had reiterated his election commitment to boost domestic economic activity and combat deflation. The Bank of Japan announced an inflation target of 2 per cent, to be achieved ‘at the earliest possible time’ through ‘aggressive monetary easing’. ", " The US Federal Reserve had also announced a program of further purchases of longer-term Treasuries at its December meeting. Together with the previously announced program of purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities, net monthly purchases would be around US$85 billion. These would continue until the outlook for the labour market ‘improves substantially’. In addition to its guidance regarding asset purchases, the Fed had announced changes to its guidance on policy rates, which would now be specified in terms of economic thresholds rather than being temporally based. ", " In contrast, the balance sheet of the European Central Bank (ECB) had declined recently, as a portion of the ECB's earlier three-year lending had been repaid early. Overall financial conditions in Europe had improved further, most evident in the decline in funding costs for the Spanish and Italian governments, particularly for debt instruments of shorter maturities. Yields on shorter-term Italian bonds had fallen back to historical lows despite the political uncertainty caused by the announcement of upcoming elections. In Spain, the Prime Minister had reiterated that the country did not currently need a precautionary financial assistance program (as a precursor to ECB purchases of its bonds), but Spanish government yields were nonetheless benefiting from an expectation that such a program might be requested at some point. ", " In the major advanced economies, members noted that the improved sentiment and better economic data had seen government bond yields rise, although they remained near historically low levels. This was the case in Australia as well. ", " Globally, share prices had increased by 13 per cent over 2012, and by 7 per cent from the time of the December Board meeting. Australian equity markets had also moved up largely in line with global markets. Japanese equity markets had risen by around 30 per cent since the announcement in mid November of an election in that country. ", " The Japanese election and statements by Japanese politicians had contributed to a significant depreciation of the yen since mid November. With the yen depreciating sharply, officials from an increasing number of countries had expressed concerns about the strength of their currencies. The Australian dollar had appreciated by 13 per cent against the yen since mid November, but there had been little change on a trade-weighted basis and against the US dollar. Members observed that the Australian dollar remained at a high level by historical standards. ", " Credit market conditions for non-financial corporates remained favourable as investors continued to seek higher-yielding assets. Corporates in many countries, including Australia, recorded strong bond issuance in 2012, with some of the funds raised replacing bank-intermediated credit. ", " Following the December cash rate announcement, most Australian lenders had reduced their standard variable housing rates by around 20 basis points. This reduction had brought the average interest rate on outstanding housing loans to well below its longer-run average and only a little above its 2009 low. Rates on small and large business loans were also close to their 2009 lows. ", " Members noted that competition for deposits remained strong. Deposit rates in Australia had fallen in line with the reduction in the cash rate. The cost of bond issuance had declined significantly and banks had raised a considerable amount of wholesale funding in January. It would, however, take some time for these lower bond yields to flow through to aggregate funding costs, with the movement in deposit costs having a much larger influence. ", " The Board's decision to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points in December had been fully anticipated by the market. At the time of the meeting, market pricing implied around a one-in-four chance of a 25 basis point reduction in the cash rate at the February meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Since the December meeting, global economic conditions had been a little more positive and the downside risks had abated somewhat. The United States had avoided the full extent of the large fiscal contraction that had been legislated. Along with the earlier policy measures in the euro area and plans announced by the new government in Japan, this had contributed to improved financial market conditions. Data from China continued to indicate that growth had stabilised after the softening earlier in the year. The pick-up in industrial activity had contributed to higher bulk commodity prices, although not all of the rise in prices was expected to be sustained. ", " Domestically, data since the previous meeting had been mixed. The labour market had softened a little further, while inflation remained contained and consistent with the target. This was expected to remain the case for the next year or two. Over 2012, the economy appeared to have grown at around trend pace. Resource exports had increased strongly up to December and a range of indicators pointed to further gradual improvement in conditions in the housing market. On the other hand, housing finance remained relatively subdued, and indicators suggested that non-mining business investment would continue to be weak in the near term. Businesses' external debt funding had increased at a steady pace in recent months. Growth in economic activity was expected to be a little below trend over 2013, before picking up to around trend through 2014. ", " In response to the weakening in the outlook for economic activity domestically, and with inflation remaining contained, the Board had reduced the cash rate by 175 basis points since late in 2011, including by 50 basis points in the last quarter of 2012. Interest rate sensitive parts of the economy had shown some signs of responding to these lower rates, which were well below their longer-run averages, and further effects could be expected over time. At the same time, the exchange rate remained high despite the terms of trade having declined significantly since peaking about 18 months earlier. The inflation outlook, as assessed at this meeting, would afford scope to ease policy further, should that be necessary to support demand. Noting that monetary policy was already accommodative as a result of the substantial easing of policy over the past 15 months, and that this stimulus was continuing to work its way through the economy, the Board judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged at this meeting.

A range of monthly indicators suggested that China's economic growth had continued at a steady pace, with strong contributions continuing to come from infrastructure and real estate investment. Conditions in the housing market had picked up noticeably over recent months. The central authorities had announced further support for social housing construction as well as additional restrictions on property transactions. ", " Conditions had recently been more favourable in the rest of east Asia than had been the case for most of 2012. Across much of the region, export values increased in early 2013 while industrial production had been flat, although generally higher than several months earlier. In India, GDP had increased strongly in the December quarter, after two very weak quarters. In Japan, measures of business and consumer confidence had picked up, along with inflation expectations, following the earlier announcements of fiscal expansion and changes to the monetary policy framework. ", " Members observed that the US economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, with private sector demand strengthening further. Household spending had increased in recent months despite tax increases from 1 January, and housing sector indicators had shown further improvement. The pace of growth in non-farm payrolls had increased over recent months and the unemployment rate was lower than it had been in the middle of 2012. At the same time, however, budget spending cuts effective from 1 March were expected to weigh on growth this year. ", " Members noted the contrast with the euro area, where conditions remained poor. GDP declined in the December quarter and the unemployment rate had risen again in January, to almost 12 per cent. While some indicators had improved a little recently – including consumer confidence, retail sales and exports – activity overall was likely to remain subdued in early 2013. Negotiations over the support package for Cyprus had again highlighted the fragility of conditions in the euro area. ", " The spot price for iron ore had declined over the past month, consistent with earlier expectations of a correction from recent high levels. Other commodity prices had been little changed overall. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the national accounts data, released the day after the March Board meeting, confirmed that growth of the economy was close to trend over 2012 as a whole, but with slower growth over the second half of the year. GDP expanded by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, reflecting strong growth in resources exports, mining investment and dwelling investment, while household consumption recorded modest growth and public demand declined further. Overall growth over the year was 3.1 per cent, which, with total hours worked recording a small decline over the same period, implied strong growth in labour productivity. ", " The limited new data to hand for this meeting were broadly consistent with the earlier outlook for the economy. In particular, mining investment still appeared to be close to its peak (and hence its impetus to growth was likely to slow) but resources exports were projected to continue to grow strongly. A moderate rise in dwelling investment was expected and household consumption was forecast to grow broadly in line with household incomes, while growth in public demand was likely to be modest. Non-mining investment was likely to remain subdued in the near term but to pick up gradually in the second half of 2013. ", " Recent indicators suggested that growth of consumption had increased over recent months after a softer December quarter. The value of retail sales picked up strongly in January and the Bank's liaison pointed to further growth in February and March. Motor vehicle sales had remained high, though they had fallen a little from their recent peak. In addition, measures of consumer confidence had risen to be clearly above their long-run averages. ", " Members observed that conditions in the housing market had continued to improve. House prices increased again over March, to be 4¼ per cent above their mid-2012 trough, auction clearance rates had moved higher and there were signs of somewhat stronger growth in housing loan approvals. The Bank's liaison with home builders suggested that demand for new housing had been a little more positive of late, with a rise in activity reported in most capital cities. ", " Surveys of business conditions were somewhat mixed over the month, although conditions generally remained a little below long-run averages. Business conditions appeared to have improved for the construction industry overall but declined in the mining sector, notwithstanding the prospect of strong growth in resources exports. Information from the Bank's liaison indicated some willingness on the part of firms outside the mining sector to increase investment spending, especially on information technology assets and systems. Business debt was still growing, albeit at a somewhat slower pace over recent months; credit to smaller businesses was rising at a steady pace and large corporations were able to access non-intermediated funds. ", " Members discussed the various labour market indicators. There was a surprisingly large increase in employment in February, accompanied by a rise in the participation rate. However, a substantial part of the increase in employment appeared to reflect changes in the sample. The unemployment rate, which tends to be less volatile than employment growth, was unchanged at 5.4 per cent. While the most recent quarterly data showed a decline in vacancies, higher-frequency forward-looking indicators showed tentative signs of stabilising. Overall, these indicators were consistent with moderate growth in employment in the months ahead. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members opened their discussion on financial markets with the observation that markets had remained generally calm over the past month, despite the uncertainty emanating from developments in Cyprus. In order to secure financial assistance of up to €10 billion from the European authorities and the IMF, the Cypriot Government had initially proposed a one-time levy on all bank deposits in Cyprus, including insured deposits, but this failed to pass the Cypriot Parliament. A second proposal had now been made, involving the winding up of Cyprus' second largest bank – with bond and equity holders basically losing everything and a significant ‘haircut’ imposed on large depositors – as well as the recapitalisation of the largest bank, which would see shareholders, bondholders and large depositors again sharing some of the financial burden. ", " To date, members noted that there had been little apparent spill-over from these events to other financial markets. Spanish and Italian government bond yields were little changed, notwithstanding the continued absence of a government in Italy as a result of the recent election. Expectations of further asset purchases by the Bank of Japan had contributed to a decline in government bond yields in Japan to near record lows, while those in major European markets also fell. US bond yields were little changed. Members noted, however, that the various resolution proposals in Cyprus may have increased the risk of future depositor withdrawals in other countries in times of increased uncertainty. ", " Funding conditions for non-financial corporates in the major markets had remained favourable. Issuance in the United States and the euro area had been strong, including by sub-investment grade companies, while issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities in Australia in the March quarter had been the strongest in nearly two years, with much of the issuance coming from the non-bank sector. ", " Members observed that little spill-over from the Cypriot crisis had been evident in most equity markets as well, with share prices in both the United States and euro area higher over the past month, while the Japanese market had risen by around 10 per cent (to be more than 50 per cent above its 2012 low point). In contrast, share prices in Australia had fallen over the past month – with the declines most pronounced in the major resources stocks – although this had followed a period of relative outperformance. ", " Most major currencies continued their recent trends. The Japanese yen depreciated further against the US dollar as the new Governor of the Bank of Japan stated that the central bank would do ‘whatever it can’ to achieve the new inflation target of 2 per cent. The euro had depreciated against the US dollar as a result of developments in Cyprus, while better-than-expected domestic economic data saw the Australian dollar reach its highest level on a trade-weighted basis since early 1985. Members again noted that the exchange rate remained high despite the terms of trade having declined significantly since peaking about 18 months earlier. ", " Members were updated on the funding composition of Australian banks, with deposits rising further as a share of total funding, despite being more expensive than comparable wholesale funding sources. Average interest rates on outstanding housing and business loans had been largely unchanged since the end of February. In the money market, current pricing implied a very small expectation of an easing in monetary policy at the current meeting, and less than one 25 basis point easing priced in by the end of the year. Members also discussed recent changes announced by the Australian Financial Market Association to the way in which the bank bill swap rate in Australia would be set in future. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Global economic conditions were consistent with growth generally being close to average, but with Europe the main area of weakness. Indications were that the Chinese economy had continued to grow at a steady pace and signs of improved economic conditions across the rest of Asia had emerged over the past six months or so. In the United States, growth of private demand was acting to offset the headwinds associated with fiscal consolidation. While the risks to the global outlook appeared to be more balanced than they had been in the preceding year, recent events had highlighted the fact that important vulnerabilities remained, particularly in Europe. With activity across Europe as a whole expected to remain weak this year, there was some risk of further adverse feedback between fiscal restraint and economic activity. Despite recent turmoil in Cyprus, financial markets had remained generally calm. ", " Domestically, the national accounts showed that GDP growth was around trend over the year to the December quarter, but slower in the second half of the year. Over the past few months, housing loan approvals had picked up for both owner-occupiers and investors, and stronger conditions in the established housing market more generally were expected to support moderate growth of dwelling investment this year. ", " Business investment outside the resources sector remained subdued. While there remained uncertainty about its anticipated pick-up, the recent data were, on balance, consistent with this pick-up taking place. In general, access to funding did not appear to have been an impediment to investment. Firms in some industries had shown a willingness to add to their workforce – including in the construction industry – and recent labour market data had been mixed. ", " Members noted that the national accounts pointed to further growth in productivity over the year to the December quarter. The Bank's forecasts for inflation to remain close to the target over the next year or so assumed ongoing productivity growth and wage growth remaining around the more moderate pace of recent quarters. ", " Overall, recent data suggested that interest-sensitive parts of the economy were responding to the historically low levels of lending rates and it remained likely that this had further to run. At the same time, the factors weighing on the economy – including the high exchange rate, the waning growth of mining investment, and fiscal consolidation – were likely to persist. The key issues were what the balance of these factors would turn out to be. With growth forecast to be a little below trend in 2013, and inflation close to target, members judged that it was appropriate for the stance of policy to be accommodative. The outlook for inflation, as currently assessed, would provide scope for further easing should that be necessary to support demand. At this meeting, the Board's judgement remained that, on the information currently to hand, the most prudent course was to hold rates steady and to continue to assess developments over the period ahead.

", " Growth in the Chinese economy had slowed a little in the March quarter, primarily reflecting weaker consumption growth, but had remained a little above 7½ per cent, which was the authorities' stated target for growth. Strong infrastructure investment and demand for residential property were likely to continue to support steady growth in the economy in the coming quarters. In east Asia, growth appeared to have slowed a little in the March quarter after picking up quite strongly at the end of 2012; consumption in the lower-income economies continued to grow at a faster pace than in the higher-income economies. In Japan, there was increased optimism about future economic prospects following the fiscal and monetary policy initiatives and tentative signs of increased activity. ", " Members observed that the US economy had continued to grow at a moderate pace. In the March quarter, growth in consumption, residential investment and business investment had more than offset a large fall in public spending. The cuts to public spending that came into force in early March were expected to weigh on economic activity and limit growth through 2013 to a moderate pace. Members noted that the unemployment rate had been declining slowly, and that stronger employment growth would be needed for this to continue if the participation rate were to recover. ", " The euro area had remained in recession, with the level of GDP still below the peak prior to the financial crisis, although there were tentative signs that economic activity was stabilising. Members noted that it was possible that some countries would ease their fiscal austerity programs. ", " Most commodity prices had declined over the month following some weaker-than-expected global economic data. Coking coal and base metals prices had fallen to the low levels seen last year. There had also been falls in the prices of iron ore, crude oil and precious metals, while the prices for rural commodities had been little changed. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Consumer price inflation had been a bit lower than had generally been expected. The quarterly rate of CPI inflation declined in the March quarter, to 0.1 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, while year-ended CPI inflation was 2.5 per cent. The various measures suggested that underlying inflation had been just below ½ per cent in the March quarter, and a little below 2½ per cent over the year. The year-ended inflation rates reflected the increase in some prices that flowed from the introduction of the carbon price and changes to the private health insurance rebate in the previous year. ", " Prices of tradable items fell substantially in the March quarter, with price declines widespread across items despite the relative stability of the exchange rate over the past couple of years. Members discussed the downward pressures on domestic costs and margins and the resulting declines in tradables prices, and whether these pressures would continue. In contrast to tradables inflation, non-tradables inflation appeared to have increased a little over the past year (abstracting from the direct effect of government policy changes). In the March quarter, inflation in new dwelling costs had risen, although inflation in a range of market services and non-traded food prices had eased. ", " Other domestic data over the past few months had been mostly consistent with the earlier forecasts for growth of economic activity to remain a little below trend over 2013. Labour market conditions had remained somewhat subdued in recent months and the unemployment rate had edged higher, with trend employment growth below the rate of growth in the working-age population. Indicators of job advertisements suggested a degree of stabilisation, albeit at relatively low levels, while the Bank's liaison suggested that firms remained cautious about hiring staff. ", " Members noted that household consumption appeared to have strengthened early this year. The volume of retail sales had increased noticeably in the March quarter, and liaison suggested that retail sales had increased further in April. Indicators of consumer sentiment were above average levels, with reported buying conditions for dwellings and motor vehicles at relatively high levels. Sales of motor vehicles declined in the March quarter but remained at a high level. ", " Dwelling prices were around 4 per cent above their trough in mid 2012, and auction clearance rates had increased. New borrowing for housing had also picked up, while forward-looking indicators and the Bank's business liaison suggested that demand for new housing was improving – notwithstanding a decline in building approvals in the March quarter – with enquiries from prospective purchasers and visits to display homes increasing. New dwelling investment had increased since the middle of the previous year, with members observing that approvals for higher-density dwellings had increased, while approvals for detached dwellings had been flat over this period. ", " Members noted that survey-based measures of conditions in the business sector remained below average, although some measures of business confidence had picked up a little in recent months. Indicators of business investment in the near term remained soft: capital imports had declined in recent months, office vacancy rates had risen and indicators of capacity utilisation were below long-run average levels. Liaison continued to suggest that firms remained cautious about undertaking significant expansion. Consistent with this, growth of business debt had been more modest in the early part of 2013. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. The outlook overall was little changed since the February Statement on Monetary Policy. GDP growth was expected to be a little below trend over 2013, before picking up to an around trend pace through 2014. The forecasts continued to incorporate the effect of both fiscal consolidation and the high level of the Australian dollar, as well as the approaching peak in mining investment. ", " Members noted that the nature of mining investment was changing. There had been some pull-back in coal investment plans in the previous year and a significant amount of investment in iron ore projects had been completed. In contrast, a larger share of ongoing mining investment related to LNG projects, which were based on long-term supply contracts. This characteristic implied less uncertainty about mining investment arising from volatility in commodity prices over the next couple of years. ", " The effects of stimulatory monetary policy were continuing to emerge. Improved conditions in the housing market and strong population growth were also expected to support dwelling investment and household spending more generally. While growth in business investment outside the mining sector looked to have been a little softer than expected in the first half of 2013, it was forecast to pick up to a moderate pace over the remainder of this year and into 2014. This was consistent with the most recent ABS survey of firms' capital expenditure plans. ", " Conditions in the labour market were expected to remain somewhat subdued in the near term, with growth of employment projected to be below that of the working-age population over coming quarters. Employment growth was then forecast to pick up as output growth gradually improved. Consistent with the forecast for the labour market over the next year or so, wage growth was expected to remain moderate over the forecast period. ", " In the near term, the outlook was for inflation on a year-ended basis to be a little lower than had been published in the February Statement on Monetary Policy, largely reflecting lower-than-expected inflation in the March quarter. At a quarterly pace, underlying inflation was expected to be close to the middle of the target over the course of the next two years. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets over the past month with the announcement by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) of a range of policy measures that sought to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target. The new policy measures included a shift in the BoJ's operational target from an overnight interest rate to a measure of the money base, and were more expansionary than had been anticipated by markets. Overall, the measures were expected to double the BoJ's holdings of Japanese government bonds over the coming two years and thereby boost the size of its balance sheet to nearly 60 per cent of GDP. Members noted that, while the absolute size of these purchases was smaller than the US Federal Reserve's comparable program, they would be much larger relative to the size of the economy. ", " Japanese bond yields had fallen sharply immediately following the BoJ's announcement, with the 10‑year yield falling to a record intraday low of 32 basis points, before quickly rising in highly volatile conditions. These movements reflected investors' uncertainty about whether the measures would eventually lead to inflation of 2 per cent, and members noted that success in this regard would be likely to result in Japanese bond yields rising significantly at some point. Members noted that developments in wages in Japan over the next year or two would be a key indicator of the success or otherwise of this policy. ", " Members were briefed on the initial market commentary around the BoJ's announcement, which had suggested this policy action would prompt Japanese investors to allocate more of their funds to offshore securities. Members discussed the likely incentives of the various holders of Japanese government bonds to invest offshore. They noted that, to date, there had been little evidence of Japanese investors increasing their offshore holdings. If anything, the evidence was to the contrary, with flows back into Japan since late 2012, as domestic investors sought to realise valuation gains arising from the large decline in the yen. ", " Apart from the yen, exchange rates generally had been little changed, with the Australian dollar remaining high by historical standards despite depreciating a little against most currencies. The Chinese renminbi (RMB) had appreciated over the past month, and members noted that the Australian dollar had recently become the fifth currency to be approved for direct trading against the RMB in the Chinese onshore market, with trading having commenced on 10 April. ", " The recent depreciation in the yen had also contributed to a further sharp rise in Japanese share prices, which were now more than 60 per cent above their trough the previous year. Elsewhere, equity prices had generally been a little higher over the past month, with China the main exception as softer-than-expected Chinese economic data contributed to further declines in equity markets. Australian share prices had increased, as gains in the financial sector, following strong earnings reports by Australian banks, had more than offset a decline in the resources sector associated with lower commodity prices. Members noted that share prices of Australian banks had gained around 30 per cent since November 2012. ", " Government bond yields had again approached their historic lows in Germany and the United States during April. The declines in yields on Spanish and Italian government debt had been particularly noticeable, with 10-year yields currently around 4 per cent. This in part reflected speculation about increased demand from Japanese investors, although there had been little evidence to suggest such demand had emerged yet. Bond yields in Australia had declined further, with the yield on three-year Australian government bonds again below the cash rate. ", " Credit market conditions in the major markets remained favourable as investors sought higher-yielding assets, with spreads continuing to narrow for lower-rated non-financial corporates. In Australia, corporate bond spreads reached their lowest levels since 2008 and yields were at their lowest levels since at least the early 2000s. ", " The Board's decision to leave the cash rate unchanged in April had been largely expected by financial markets. Over the month, average interest rates on outstanding housing and business loans had remained largely unchanged. Members noted that current market pricing implied a near even chance of the cash rate being lowered at the May meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Since the April Board meeting, data on the global economy had been somewhat mixed and commodity prices had declined. Even so, growth of Australia's trading partners was still expected to be around average this year, before picking up gradually next year. ", " Domestically, the data on economic activity since the previous meeting had not materially changed the earlier staff forecasts. A range of indicators pointed to a pick-up in spending by the household sector, conditions in the housing market remained generally positive and measures of consumer confidence had been above average. In contrast, measures of business conditions had remained below average and business investment outside the resources sector was expected to remain subdued in the near term. Employment growth had remained moderate and the unemployment rate had edged a little higher, which had been broadly as expected. ", " Inflation in the March quarter had been a little lower than expected, driven by falls in the prices of tradable items. At the same time, inflation in non-tradable items appeared to have increased a little over the past year. Overall, the staff forecast remained for inflation to be consistent with the target over the next couple of years. ", " Growth in economic activity was still expected to be a little below trend this year, picking up gradually to be close to trend through 2014. The near-term forecast reflected the slowing in overall business investment, given the peak in the mining investment boom along with the effects of fiscal consolidation and the high level of the exchange rate. This was expected to be partly offset by growth of resources exports, a pick-up in consumption and moderate growth in dwelling investment. ", " With inflation contained and domestic economic activity forecast to be below trend over the period ahead, the Board had maintained the cash rate at a level consistent with borrowing rates being close to previous lows. Increasingly, the household sector had shown signs of responding to these low rates: wealth had been bolstered by higher equity and dwelling prices; measures of consumer confidence were above average; housing and personal loan approvals had been rising, although credit growth remained subdued to date; and dwelling construction activity was growing. At the same time, however, conditions in the business sector, as assessed in surveys, generally had remained below average, possibly in part because the exchange rate had remained high despite lower export prices and interest rates. ", " For some months the Board had considered that the inflation outlook provided scope to ease monetary policy further, should that be necessary to support demand. Members recognised that the effects of the earlier reductions in interest rates were still working through the economy. Nonetheless, growth was expected to be somewhat below trend for a while, and the inflation outlook had, if anything, been revised down slightly. Members were conscious of the strengthening conditions in the housing market, but also noted that, thus far, credit growth had remained subdued. Taking all the factors into consideration, the Board decided that some of the scope to ease policy should be used at this meeting.

{"Date": ["Brisbane - 2 July 2013"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Jonathan Kearns (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "Financial Markets": [" Members opened their discussion with the observation that the main driver of financial markets over the past month had been the reappraisal by the markets of the future path of monetary policy in the United States. Following its policy meeting in June, the Federal Reserve had reiterated that it would not consider raising the federal funds rate as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ per cent and inflation expectations were well behaved. However, the Fed had added that if its forecast for the economy came to pass, it would expect to begin scaling back its rate of bond purchases later this year, and to end bond purchases completely in mid 2014. While there was little new in this statement, financial markets subsequently brought forward their expectation of the first increase in the federal funds rate to early 2015 from the end of that year. ", " Reflecting this assessment, US 10-year bond yields had risen by 40 basis points, following a 50 basis point rise in May. Volatility in fixed income markets had also increased, which had added further to the rise in yields by reducing the willingness to take risk. While the reaction to the Fed's statement may have been disproportionate to its news content, members observed that the level of US 10-year yields, at 2½ per cent, was still low by historical standards. ", " The shift in expectations about US monetary policy had affected most markets. Notably, mortgage rates in the United States (pricing of which tended to be linked to longer-term yields) had risen further, along with bond yields in all major markets apart from Japan, where the market had been relatively settled after the volatility in the previous month. Spreads between euro area periphery bonds and German Bunds had widened, with Spanish and Italian yields rising to around 5 per cent for a time. ", " The Australian 10-year bond yield had moved broadly in line with US yields and rose to more than 4 per cent at one point during June, the highest level in more than a year. Spreads on state government debt remained narrow, which was somewhat unusual given the heightened volatility in bond yields. The volatility in fixed income markets had been associated with limited issuance both globally and locally, including minimal new issuance by Australian banks over the past month. ", " Members noted that riskier asset markets, which had been the recipient of large capital inflows resulting from the accommodative monetary policy settings in the major economies, had been most affected by the shift in expectations about US monetary policy. Currencies and share markets of emerging market economies had fallen sharply, while sovereign bond yields in those countries had increased to their highest levels in around a year. ", " Another factor contributing to the volatility in financial markets was a tightening of short-term liquidity conditions in China. It appeared that the People's Bank of China was comfortable with some tightening in the interbank market to help rein in the pace of credit growth, particularly in the ‘shadow’ banking system where growth had been strong in the first half of 2013. ", " The rise in global bond yields had been mostly associated with weaker equity prices in the major economies, although the decline in the US equity market had been less than had occurred elsewhere. Japanese equity prices had fallen particularly sharply and reversed most of the gains since the Bank of Japan had introduced its new policy measures in early April. Chinese equity prices also experienced large declines, reflecting the tightening in financial conditions there, while Australian equity prices had reversed almost all of the previous gains over the year to date, with the biggest falls occurring in resources stocks. ", " Members noted that the US developments had led to a small decline in the US dollar on a trade-weighted basis, notwithstanding an increase in terms of most emerging market currencies and relative stability against the euro. ", " These global developments had also seen a further depreciation in the Australian dollar. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar was around 12 per cent below the high reached in early April and close to its lowest level since September 2010. Overall, domestic financial markets viewed the lower exchange rate as reducing the need for monetary policy to be eased further, with the market at the time of the meeting attaching a 25 per cent probability of a decline in the cash rate occurring in July, with only a single reduction expected by the end of the year. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members observed that the data released over the past month were consistent with growth of Australia's major trading partners remaining around average. Monthly indicators of economic activity continued to point to steady growth of the Chinese economy, with stable growth in investment and ongoing demand for new housing. It remained too early to tell how long the tightening in financial conditions in China would be sustained and what its effect on borrowing and economic activity might be. ", " The recovery in the United States appeared to be continuing at a moderate pace, notwithstanding some signs that fiscal consolidation was weighing on private demand. The pace of growth in household consumption had slowed a little in recent months and industrial production had been somewhat subdued. Against this, however, a wide range of indicators pointed to further improvement in the housing sector and total employment continued to grow at around the same pace as the average of the past year or so. ", " In Japan, economic activity had strengthened a little further in recent months but few details had been provided on the anticipated structural reforms. In the rest of east Asia, after softer-than-expected growth in the March quarter, data available for April and May pointed to improved growth in the June quarter. ", " The euro area economy remained weak, with GDP across much of the region likely to have declined again in the June quarter, although activity appeared to be more resilient in Germany than elsewhere. ", " Measured in foreign currency terms, most global commodity prices had declined in recent months. Spot prices for bulk commodities had declined further, while prices for base metals and oil had also fallen to around their mid-2012 levels. Members observed, however, that, in Australian dollar terms, Australia's commodity export prices had changed little over recent months because of the recent exchange rate depreciation. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The national accounts for the March quarter were released the day after the June Board meeting and confirmed the Bank's expectation that GDP had continued to grow at a pace a bit below trend in recent quarters. Members noted that consumption was weaker than had been implied by the relatively strong pick-up in retail sales in the March quarter, while business investment declined and dwelling investment was flat. Exports increased further in the quarter, particularly resources, while imports fell sharply in line with the decline in mining investment. ", " More timely indicators of economic activity had been broadly consistent with growth remaining below trend. Retail sales were flat in April, though the Bank's liaison contacts suggested that sales rose modestly in May and June. Measures of consumer sentiment were close to long-run averages, although consumers' concerns about unemployment had been high and increased in June. ", " Members noted that conditions in the housing sector continued to improve gradually. Overall, dwelling investment was flat in the March quarter as continued growth in investment in new dwellings was offset by lower spending on alterations and additions. Forward-looking indicators for new construction continued to be favourable, with the number of building approvals increasing strongly in April and loan approvals rising noticeably over recent months, including for new dwellings. Dwelling prices increased over the June quarter and auction clearance rates remained high by historical standards. This was consistent with the Bank's liaison with builders, which suggested that housing conditions had improved further in most states. ", " Survey-based measures of business conditions improved in May, but were still a little below long-run average levels. Over the past few months, measures of sentiment had improved for some industries, including construction and business services, and declined slightly for other industries, most notably mining and manufacturing. While the volume of resources exports had risen further, and was expected to continue to grow with the addition of new capacity for bulk commodities, the decline in commodity prices over the past year or so had weighed on the resources sector. Members noted that while mining investment remained at a high level, planning and development work related to future projects had declined significantly since the previous year. Even so, given the considerable volume of firmly committed work, mining investment was likely to remain high for some quarters. ", " Members were briefed that the Bank's liaison suggested that the near-term outlook for non-mining business investment remained modest, in line with a range of other indicators and survey measures. At the same time, however, the depreciation of the exchange rate over the past two months was expected to provide more supportive conditions for the tradable sector. ", " Labour market conditions remained somewhat subdued. While changes in employment had been volatile from month to month, year-ended growth, at a little over 1 per cent, continued to be below population growth. Overall, unemployment had been on a gradual upward trend over the past year or so, even though the unemployment rate ticked down to 5.5 per cent in May. Average hours worked declined further in May and were at a two-year low. Over the past few months, employment growth had been strongest in New South Wales and South Australia. Employment had been flat to declining in Queensland and Western Australia, consistent with a decline in demand associated with mining-related activity in those states. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand implied only modest growth in employment in the months ahead. ", " There had been little new data on prices or wages during the month. The national accounts measure of average earnings per hour fell in the March quarter, although this measure is typically quite volatile from one quarter to the next. While measured productivity growth had also slowed a little of late from a high rate, members observed that unit labour costs had actually declined over the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Overall economic activity in Australia's major trading partners appeared to have been growing at close to its long-run average over recent months, and while commodity prices continued to decline, they were little changed in Australian dollar terms over the past two months because of the exchange rate depreciation. ", " Recent data suggested that domestic economic activity continued to grow at a below trend pace. The outlook for both mining and non-mining business investment remained uncertain. Mining investment was likely to remain high for some quarters given the considerable volume of firmly committed work, even though it looked to be close to, if not past, its peak. At some time beyond that, however, mining investment was expected to decline more rapidly, partly reflecting a significant decline in the planning and development work that is a precondition for new projects. Resources exports were expanding at a strong rate and this was expected to continue as projects currently under construction began production. The outlook for investment in the non-mining business sector remained for moderate growth, but near-term indicators for investment were still somewhat subdued. ", " The effects of lower interest rates were apparent across a range of indicators and, given the lags involved in the transmission of monetary policy, this process had further to run. The effects to date were most evident in the housing market and were expected to be apparent in further growth in dwelling investment. ", " The news in recent months had generally been consistent with the outlook for growth being a little below trend and inflation remaining consistent with the medium-term target. The most significant change had been the depreciation of the exchange rate, though members noted that it remained at a high level. The depreciation was expected to add a little to inflation over time, but the forecast was for inflation to remain consistent with the target. Members noted that it was possible that the exchange rate would depreciate further over time as the terms of trade and mining investment declined, which would help to foster a rebalancing of growth in the economy. ", " Given the exchange rate adjustment that was occurring, and with the substantial degree of monetary stimulus already in place, members assessed the current stance of policy to be appropriate for the time being. The Board also judged that the inflation outlook, although slightly higher because of the exchange rate depreciation, could still provide some scope for further easing, should that be required to support demand.

Total social financing flows (a measure of credit) moderated in June from the high levels seen earlier in the year, although conditions in the housing market remained buoyant. ", " In Japan, a range of indicators of economic activity had improved over the past couple of quarters and import prices were rising in response to the exchange rate depreciation, thereby contributing to a slight rise in consumer prices overall. In the rest of east Asia, weaker external demand had weighed on growth, but with domestic demand remaining relatively resilient, GDP was estimated to be growing at close to average. ", " Members observed that the US economic recovery had continued at a moderate pace, notwithstanding the effect of fiscal consolidation. Conditions in the household sector continued to improve, with employment growing at a steady pace since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate declining. Further rises in prices and turnover in the established housing market were supporting the growth of dwelling investment. In contrast, economic activity in the euro area remained weak. ", " The Board was briefed on the updated staff forecasts for global growth. Aggregate growth of Australia's major trading partners – including China – was expected to be a bit below its decade average in 2013 before picking up somewhat in the following year. The forecast had been revised a little lower since the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, with the change reflecting the accumulation of news over the previous three months and the Bank's assessment that growth in China was unlikely to pick up much, if at all, in coming quarters. ", " Commodity prices overall had been little changed over the past month. The spot price for iron ore had moved higher along with Chinese steel prices, while prices for coal remained low following the large falls earlier in the year. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the news received on domestic activity over the month was consistent with Australian economic growth being below trend in the June quarter. ", " Indicators of household consumption had suggested continued moderate conditions overall. Motor vehicle sales grew in the June quarter, but had fallen in July. Retail sales data showed that spending was flat in real terms in the June quarter and liaison pointed to only modest growth more recently. Consumer sentiment had declined since earlier in the year to be close to average levels. Overall, the softer run of recent indicators of consumption was consistent with the somewhat subdued conditions in the labour market. The unemployment rate rose a bit further in June, to 5.7 per cent, while trend employment growth had declined a little over the past few months. ", " In contrast, conditions in the housing sector had continued to improve. Auction clearance rates remained high and dwelling prices had increased further in recent months. A number of indicators were pointing to a further recovery in dwelling investment, consistent with the low level of interest rates. Residential building approvals, especially for detached housing, had increased in the June quarter and loan approvals were at their highest level in over three years. Members did, nevertheless, note that dwelling investment had thus far experienced a muted recovery relative to past cyclical upturns. ", " Survey measures of business conditions had remained below average and members noted an apparent reluctance on the part of businesses to take on new risks. Non-mining business investment remained subdued and a range of indicators suggested that this was likely to persist in the near term. Mining investment had been at a high level although it looked set to decline over coming years. Consistent with this, imports of capital goods had declined from the high levels in the previous year. ", " Exports had continued to grow in the June quarter. Strong growth in resources exports was expected in coming quarters, with increased productive capacity coming on line following the high level of investment in the mining sector. ", " Largely as expected, the inflation data for the June quarter had indicated that underlying inflation was a touch above ½ per cent in the quarter and just under 2½ per cent over the year. CPI inflation picked up in the quarter, to 0.5 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms and 2.4 per cent over the year. The year-ended rates of both CPI and underlying inflation incorporated the introduction of the carbon price from July 2012. ", " The prices of tradable items rose slightly in the June quarter, following falls in the previous two quarters. In large part this was attributable to unchanged prices of consumer durables following recent significant declines. Historically, these prices show a strong relationship with the exchange rate, although it was too early for the recent depreciation to have affected retail prices of most goods and services, with petrol prices a notable exception. ", " Non-tradables inflation had eased a little in the June quarter, consistent with the softer wage growth over the past year. Indeed, quarterly inflation in the prices of market services, for which labour is a significant cost component, had been quite a bit lower than in recent quarters. In contrast, year-ended housing inflation remained relatively high, partly reflecting the effect of the carbon price on utilities prices but also some increase in demand in the housing market. ", " The Board was briefed on revisions to the staff forecasts, which reflected the combination of the recent run of generally weaker data, a lowering in the expected profile for mining investment and the effects of the recent exchange rate depreciation. GDP growth was expected to remain below trend, at close to 2½ per cent through to mid 2014, before picking up thereafter. ", " The outlook for employment growth was slightly weaker than at the time of the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, consistent with the revisions to the GDP forecast. Employment growth was expected to remain modest over the next few quarters, before subsequently increasing in line with the forecast higher growth in GDP. ", " The staff's inflation forecast incorporated the offsetting influences of a slightly weaker outlook for the labour market (and the economy more generally) and the significant depreciation of the exchange rate, with the latter expected to boost prices of tradable items gradually over the next few years. In the near term, these effects were expected roughly to offset one another. In year-ended terms, underlying inflation was expected to remain close to the lower end of the inflation target range this year, before picking up to around the middle of the target in the first half of 2014 and staying close to that rate thereafter. "], "Financial Markets": [" The outlook for US monetary policy continued to be the main focus of global financial markets during July. Members noted that market conditions had been calmer than over the previous two months, as comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke had repeated that any future reduction in US monetary stimulus remained conditional on the economic data. Financial markets generally expected that the Fed would begin tapering its asset purchases from around September 2013, and had priced in the first increase in the Fed's policy rate by mid 2015. ", " After having risen by around 90 basis points over the previous two months, US 10-year bond yields showed little net change in July. Members noted that, at 2½–2¾ per cent, those yields appeared more reflective of the outlook for the US economy than when they had been in the 1½–1¾ per cent range. In Europe, comparable yields were little changed, after initially following the increase in US yields, as both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England sought to distinguish their economies' weaker circumstances from those prevailing in the United States. In Japan, 10-year government bond yields were also little changed over the month, while those in Australia had generally moved in line with those in the United States, though to a somewhat lesser extent, resulting in a narrowing in the relevant spread towards 100 basis points. ", " The reappraisal by the markets of future changes in the Fed's monetary policy had led to yields on emerging market government bonds partially reversing their earlier rises. Members observed, however, that central banks in a number of emerging market economies had tightened policy and/or intervened in currency markets, because of concerns about the speed and extent to which the capital inflows over the past few years could reverse when US monetary policy became less expansionary. ", " With conditions in debt markets less volatile than in the recent past, issuance by corporates picked up in July, particularly for financials in the United States and other developed markets. Corporate yields showed a modest decline over the month, although there was little change in spreads. ", " Members noted that the most significant effect of the reappraisal by the markets of the outlook for US monetary policy had been in global equity markets. Most markets had risen by around 5 per cent over the past month, with additional support provided by some stronger-than-expected economic data and corporate earnings results. US equity prices had reached a fresh historical high, while Japanese share prices had pared back more than one-third of the loss since their peak in May, to be 50 per cent higher than in mid November 2012. Australian equity prices had also moved broadly in line with global indices. Chinese equity prices provided a notable exception to global trends, posting a more modest increase than in other markets and remaining significantly lower than at the start of the year. While the tightening in interbank liquidity conditions in China had eased significantly through July, there had been broader concerns among market participants about the slowing in Chinese growth and the structural challenges facing the Chinese authorities. ", " Members observed that foreign exchange markets had exhibited less volatility in July, with most major currencies showing little net change. The Chinese renminbi was relatively steady following a period of gradual appreciation. In line with generally softer economic data, the Australian dollar had depreciated further in trade-weighted terms over the past month and was now around 15 per cent below its peak in early April. ", " Turning to the funding of Australian banks, members noted that the share of deposit funding had continued to increase for banks and advertised spreads on term-deposit ‘specials’ remained at elevated levels as institutions continued to compete for deposits. ", " On the future path of Australian monetary policy, domestic financial markets had viewed the lower Australian dollar as reducing the need for the Bank to ease monetary policy further. However, with recent domestic economic data generally weaker than the market had expected, current market pricing implied a 25 basis point reduction in the cash rate at the August meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Recent information suggested that the economy was growing at a below trend pace. Indicators of consumer spending had been soft. Borrowing for housing had picked up, as had dwelling prices, and there had been an increase in leading indicators of dwelling construction, but to date this had been moderate rather than strong. Employment growth was continuing, but at a pace below the rate of growth of the labour force, and unemployment had tended to rise. Inflation remained low and, allowing for the effects of the introduction of the carbon price, was around the bottom of the target range. Wages growth was slowing. ", " The revised staff forecasts were for below trend output growth over the coming year or so, before growth was expected to pick up partly because of the effects of the recent exchange rate depreciation. The path of business investment spending would be affected by the turning of the cycle in resources investment, where indicators continued to suggest that a decline was likely over the next several years. Near-term prospects for business investment outside the resources sector remained subdued, with quite weak levels of confidence across many segments of business. In due course, inflation would be pushed up for a period by the lower exchange rate, but even so was forecast to be around the middle of the target range. ", " Members noted that there had already been a substantial easing of monetary policy over the previous 18 months. At recent meetings the Board had held the cash rate steady, but had judged that the inflation outlook might afford some scope to ease policy further, should that be necessary to support demand. The forecasts for this meeting suggested no lessening of that scope, but did show a weaker outlook for activity overall. The course of the exchange rate would be important. It had declined since the previous meeting, though remained high by historical standards. It was possible the exchange rate would decline further over time, which would assist in rebalancing growth in the economy, though it would also be affected by developments in other countries. ", " On balance, with growth expected to remain below trend for longer and inflation to remain within the target even with the effects of a lower exchange rate, members concluded that a lower level of the cash rate would better contribute to achieving sustainable growth in demand consistent with the inflation target. Regarding the communication of this decision, members agreed that the Bank should neither close off the possibility of reducing rates further, nor signal an imminent intention to reduce rates further. The Board would continue to examine the data over the months ahead to judge whether monetary policy was appropriately configured.

Growth had been driven in large part by domestic demand, with demand for property continuing to rise, although perhaps at a slower rate than earlier in the year. Along with strong growth of infrastructure investment, the demand for property was underpinning the demand for construction materials. ", " Members noted that the pick-up in activity in Japan in the June quarter had been less than expected given the available monthly indicators of activity. Nonetheless, growth had been relatively strong over the first half of the year, driven by consumption and exports. Growth in the rest of east Asia had increased in the June quarter and inflation was generally well contained. There were some concerns that recent outflows of capital may have adverse effects for a number of economies in the region and the emerging market economies more widely.

Employment had been rising moderately since the start of the year. ", " The euro area economy expanded in the June quarter for the first time in almost two years, driven by growth in Germany and France, while the rate of decline in the crisis economies had eased a little. Measures of business and consumer sentiment had improved a little from low levels and the unemployment rate had been steady over recent months. ", " There had been a modest rise in global commodity prices since the previous Board meeting. Spot prices for iron ore had increased, consistent with further growth in Chinese steel production. Crude oil and base metals prices had also risen over the past month. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members were advised that the national accounts, scheduled to be released the day after the Board meeting, were expected to show that the economy grew at a little below trend pace in the June quarter. Household consumption growth appeared to have been below the average of recent years, while business investment overall looked to have increased and exports growth remained relatively strong. ", " The ABS capital expenditure survey and information on construction work done suggested that investment increased in the June quarter after a small fall in the March quarter. There appeared to have been a pick-up in investment in buildings and structures in the mining sector, although other investment had remained soft. The survey also reported that firms' capital expenditure plans for non-mining investment remained subdued for the coming year. For the mining sector, the survey of capital expenditure plans still implied further growth in investment. However, members noted that, based on a profile for projects derived from the Bank's liaison and public statements by mining companies, the staff assessment was that mining investment was likely to decline noticeably over the next few years from its recent very high levels. Mining profits had increased in the June quarter owing in part to higher prices for iron ore, while non-mining profits had dipped in the quarter. Despite generally good access to funding, businesses still appeared averse to taking on risks associated with new investment projects. ", " Exports had been supporting overall growth in the economy. Iron ore exports had continued to grow strongly in the June quarter as new production facilities came on stream following the significant investment in recent years. Coal export volumes were also higher over the past year, although coal prices had declined. Members noted that rural exports remained at a high level, following generally good rainfall in recent years. ", " The available indicators suggested that growth of household consumption in the June quarter had been below average. Retail sales had been little changed since March and liaison contacts reported that retail sales growth had been only modest in recent months. Sales of motor vehicles to households declined in July, although this followed relatively strong growth in the June quarter. In contrast, measures of consumer sentiment had moved higher and were a little above long-run average levels. ", " Conditions in the housing sector had continued to improve in response to lower interest rates. Information to hand suggested that building activity had increased moderately in the June quarter and building approvals increased in July. Dwelling prices had increased further over recent months, to be 7 per cent above their trough in the middle of the previous year, auction clearance rates were noticeably higher than a year earlier and housing turnover had increased from relatively low levels. Overall, recent data and information from liaison were consistent with further recovery in the established housing market and moderate growth in dwelling investment. ", " Labour market conditions remained somewhat subdued. Employment had been little changed since earlier in the year, while the population had continued to expand, resulting in a decline in the employment-to-population ratio and a gradual rise in the unemployment rate. Average hours worked had picked up, although members noted that these data tend to be volatile. ", " There were further signs that wage growth had eased over the year. The wage price index rose by 0.7 per cent in the June quarter to be 2.9 per cent higher over the year, which was around ¾ percentage point below the average over the past decade. The easing in wage growth over the year had been broad based, although it was more pronounced in those states and industries with greater exposure to the resources sector. The slowing in wage growth in recent quarters was consistent with somewhat subdued conditions in the labour market, elevated concerns by households about unemployment and the lower inflation expectations of households, unions and businesses. "], "Financial Markets": [" Prospective changes in the stance of US monetary policy remained the main focus of financial markets over the past month. Members observed that while the Federal Reserve was not expected to increase its policy rate until 2015, markets anticipated that the Fed could commence ‘tapering’ its asset purchases at its September meeting. In anticipation of this, yields on 10-year US Treasuries had risen further during most of August to reach 2.9 per cent before falling because of increasing concerns about the situation in Syria. Similar rises in long-term rates had occurred in US mortgage rates and in other major bond markets. In Australia, the 10-year government bond rate had risen above 4 per cent during August before also falling. ", " Members observed that the most notable impact of the change in expectations about US monetary policy had been on emerging economies, where capital outflows had put downward pressure on exchange rates and caused domestic bond yields to rise sharply. While many emerging market economies were affected, those countries that were generally perceived to be more reliant on foreign capital had experienced the most pressure, including Brazil, India, Indonesia and Turkey. Exchange rates in these particular countries had declined by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5–10 per cent</span>  over the past month and by around 15 per cent since the end of April, notwithstanding steps taken to moderate capital outflows or offset their impact. In most cases, the authorities had undertaken exchange rate intervention, although other tools, including higher interest rates as well as restrictions on capital outflows, had been used in some cases. ", " Members noted that the authorities in these four countries appeared to be less concerned about depreciating exchange rates per se than they were about the speed of the depreciation, partly because of the implications for inflation. They also observed that emerging market economies generally had become much better placed to handle this type of pressure than in the past, with most jurisdictions now holding large foreign exchange reserves relative to their short-term debt and having relatively less foreign currency-denominated debt than in the past. ", " While share prices in the US and European markets had declined a little, the Chinese share market had risen in response to better-than-expected economic data. The Australian share market had risen slightly, with company earnings announcements generally having been received positively by investors. Higher commodity prices had also helped prices of Australian resources companies rebound strongly over the past couple of months. ", " The Board's decision to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points in August had been fully anticipated by financial markets and had been passed through to lending rates, taking them to historically low levels. Members noted that current market pricing suggested only a slight probability of a change in monetary policy in September. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " Risks to global financial stability had shifted somewhat over the past six months. Conditions in most major banking systems continued to improve. In contrast, profitability of the euro area banking system remained weak and the share of non-performing loans continued to rise. Despite further positive policy developments in the region, there was still a chance that negative outcomes in the euro area could harm global financial stability. ", " Banking systems in Asia had remained quite profitable and the ratios of non-performing loans remained low. Members noted, however, that financial systems in emerging market economies could be sensitive to a turn in sentiment stemming from changes in the outlook for US monetary policy. As previous capital inflows reversed and exchange rates depreciated, some foreign currency borrowing and lending could result in losses, especially in fast-growing financial sectors where credit risk had perhaps been building. However, indicators of vulnerability in the region were generally not as high as in earlier periods of stress. ", " Given the importance of the New Zealand business to the operations of the major Australian banks, the Board was briefed on developments in the New Zealand housing market and the macroprudential policy framework recently introduced by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. ", " The Australian banking system remained in a relatively sound position. Banks were well placed to meet the Basel III capital requirements, which APRA had begun phasing in from the start of the year. Members observed that banks' asset performance and funding structures continued to improve, and their profitability remained strong compared with that seen in most other advanced economies. In the current environment of low interest rates and slow credit growth, members agreed that it was especially important that banks maintained prudent lending standards. ", " Members noted that conditions in the domestic business and household sectors had changed little in the past six months. Although business failure rates remained above average, business balance sheets were in good shape overall. The period of deleveraging following the global financial crisis appeared to have ended, but at this stage gearing ratios in the listed corporate sector were only slightly above their recent troughs. Households continued to show prudence in managing their finances, with higher levels of saving and a slower pace of credit growth in place for some time. Members observed that the continued high rate of excess home loan repayments was consistent with low rates of financial stress among households with mortgages. Property gearing in self-managed superannuation funds was one area identified where households could be starting to take some risk with their finances; members noted that this development would be closely monitored by Bank staff in the period ahead. ", " The Board was also briefed on the extensive program of regulatory reform instigated in response to the global financial crisis, and the Bank's involvement at domestic and international levels. This multi-year program involved strengthening prudential regulation, improving arrangements for the management of distressed institutions, limiting risks of contagion in over-the-counter derivatives markets and addressing risks posed by shadow banking. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" For the domestic economy, GDP looked to have grown at a pace that was a little below trend in the June quarter and more timely data suggested a similar pace of growth over recent months. Household spending looked to have been growing at somewhat below average, although measures of consumer confidence had picked up and were a little above average. Conditions in the housing market had continued to improve in response to the current low level of lending rates. ", " Mining investment was expected to decline over the course of the next few years. With investment projects reaching completion, the strong growth in exports of bulk commodities was expected to continue for some years. Indicators of conditions elsewhere in the business sector remained subdued. The latest ABS survey of firms' investment intentions for the year ahead suggested that non-mining business investment would remain restrained in the immediate period ahead, which was consistent with the apparent reluctance of businesses to take on new risks at present. ", " The unemployment rate had continued to drift higher over the past year and indicators of labour demand remained soft. In line with this, recent wages data had been broadly softer as expected and showed that wage growth across the economy had eased over the past year. ", " The decision to reduce the cash rate at the August meeting, where the Board had judged that the outlook for inflation provided the scope to ease monetary policy further, brought the total reduction in the cash rate since late 2011 to 225 basis points. Lending rates had declined to historically low levels as a result, which, together with the lower – though still high – exchange rate, were continuing to provide a substantial degree of policy stimulus to the economy. This was most evident in the housing market, with the lags in the effect of policy meaning that earlier actions were still likely to take some time to have their full effect on demand more generally. These conditions would, over time, help the economy negotiate the prospective downshift in resources investment via a switch to other sources of demand. Some further decline in the exchange rate would be helpful in achieving such an outcome. ", " Given the substantial degree of policy stimulus in place, the Board judged that it was appropriate to retain the current setting of interest rates. Members agreed that the Bank should again neither close off the possibility of reducing rates further nor signal an imminent intention to reduce them. The Board would continue to examine the data over the months ahead to assess whether monetary policy was appropriately configured.

", " While the US economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, the latest payrolls data showed that employment growth had slowed a little in recent months. Members noted that the weakness in the labour market had been associated with softer consumption, and there were signs that the fiscal consolidation was weighing on economic activity. There was some evidence that the tightening in financial conditions over recent months had lessened the demand for mortgage finance, but the housing market overall continued to show signs of improvement. ", " In China, data released in the past month had generally been a bit stronger than earlier in the year. Key components of industrial production were growing at a little above 10 per cent and overall indications were that the Chinese economy was growing at a rate consistent with the government's target of 7.5 per cent. Non-credit financing grew strongly in August and conditions in the property market remained buoyant, with transaction volumes remaining at high levels. ", " Members noted that, in Japan, data released in the past month had been generally positive. Both exports and industrial production had rebounded following recent declines, and GDP growth in the June quarter had been revised higher, owing to an upward revision to business investment. Inflation had increased a little more, much of which was attributable to the depreciation of the yen. In the rest of Asia, there had been little data of note released in the past month. Inflation in India increased somewhat in July, which had prompted the Reserve Bank of India to tighten monetary policy. ", " In the euro area, economic conditions had improved a little in recent months, although the labour market remained very weak. Domestic demand and exports had contributed to a modest pick-up in activity in the June quarter, although credit was still contracting. ", " Commodity prices overall were a little lower over the past month. The spot prices of iron ore and Chinese steel had declined, despite Chinese steel production remaining relatively strong. Oil prices had also declined, while coking coal prices had increased slightly, albeit from relatively low levels. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The national accounts data for the June quarter, which were released the day after the previous Board meeting, confirmed that the economy had been growing at a below-trend pace up to the middle of the year. Members were informed that recent indicators suggested that growth remained below trend into the September quarter. The transition from the investment phase to the production phase of the resources boom had become more evident over the course of the past year. The decline in business investment in the June quarter, especially in mining investment, was evident in falls in investment in machinery and equipment as well as in engineering activity. Export volumes had increased, driven by higher iron ore and rural exports, and strong growth in resources exports was expected to continue in coming quarters with more mining projects scheduled to come on line. ", " Household consumption growth had been below average in the June quarter, which was consistent with the slower growth of household income that had accompanied softer conditions in the labour market. More recent indicators of consumption had been mixed, with retail sales increasing only a little in July and August, while the Bank's liaison suggested that retail sales picked up in September and motor vehicle sales to households rebounded in August. In addition, measures of consumer sentiment had increased to be clearly above average levels. ", " Household interest payments had continued to decline and conditions in the established housing market had strengthened over 2013. House prices increased by around 2½ per cent over the September quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5½ per  cent</span> over the year. However, the value of the dwelling stock relative to household income remained below the levels that had prevailed for most of the past decade. Auction clearance rates remained well above average and turnover had picked up over recent months. Loan approvals for established dwellings for both owner-occupiers and investors had increased strongly over the past year. While the growth of housing credit remained moderate, it was edging higher, with stronger growth in investor credit. ", " Dwelling investment had declined a little in the June quarter following a soft patch in building approvals earlier in the year, but dwelling construction remained higher than a year earlier and forward-looking indicators pointed to a further recovery in the second half of 2013. ", " Surveyed business conditions remained below average, although business confidence had increased noticeably to around long-run average levels. Some trade-exposed firms reported an improved outlook in the Bank's liaison, in part owing to the depreciation of the exchange rate over recent months. While this was generally yet to translate into concrete plans for higher investment spending or employment, members noted that there had been an improvement in prospects for investment in the tourism sector. Bulk commodity exports continued to grow strongly. ", " The labour market had softened further in recent months. The unemployment rate had increased to 5.8 per cent, the participation rate had declined and the level of employment was little changed from earlier in the year. Members noted that hours worked had increased. Although the hours worked data are volatile, possible explanations for the increase included changes in sectoral employment shares, increased hours for existing staff as firms attempted to contain labour costs or reluctance of firms to take on new staff. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand remained soft and the Bank's liaison suggested that employment intentions had been subdued in recent months, most notably in mining and mining-related sectors. ", " Members were briefed on longer-run changes in the industry composition of output and employment. The share of economic activity occurring in service industries had increased over time. Employment in services had recorded a greater increase than in goods-related industries, in part reflecting slower productivity growth in service industries. Over the past decade, the bulk of the increase in employment had been in service industries. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that developments in the United States continued to be the main driver of financial markets in September. Contrary to market expectations, the Federal Reserve had refrained from changing the scale of its asset purchase program at its September meeting. ", " The Federal Open Market Committee's economic outlook had changed little from the time of its June meeting, when the possibility of the Fed scaling back its asset purchases had first been signalled. However, the Fed was now seeking more certainty about the outlook before it began scaling back these purchases. In addition to discussing the prospects for US monetary policy, Board members noted the uncertainty in the US fiscal environment, with a shutdown in the federal government likely and the US government's debt ceiling being reached around mid October. ", " The Fed's decision partly reversed the recent dynamics in many financial markets, with long-term bond yields recording a sizeable fall, particularly in emerging markets. Capital outflows from emerging markets, evident in recent months, were substantially reduced. Both Bank Indonesia and the Reserve Bank of India had raised their policy rates owing to concerns about the inflationary effect of recent exchange rate depreciations. They had also announced various measures designed to encourage capital inflows. ", " Conditions in global corporate bond markets strengthened in September, particularly in the United States, where the record for issuance by a non-financial corporation was recently surpassed by a large margin. Conditions in Australian bond markets were stronger too, with the marginal cost of new long-term debt for the major banks nearing its lows of recent years and strong investor demand for several issues of mortgage-backed securities by Australian banks. ", " Members noted the rise in global equity markets as well, with noticeable rebounds in share prices in emerging markets. The Australian equity market had also risen, but by somewhat less than most other markets. ", " The Fed's decision at its September meeting led to a depreciation of the US dollar against the major currencies as well as against most other Asian and Latin American currencies, with the Indonesian rupiah a notable exception. The Australian dollar appreciated significantly against the US dollar on the day of the Fed decision and had appreciated further over the past month following the release of stronger-than-expected economic data, particularly for China. However, members noted that the Australian dollar was still around 10 per cent below its peak in April. ", " Current market pricing implied a very low likelihood of a near-term reduction in the cash rate. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Recent indicators were consistent with growth of Australia's major trading partners remaining around its long-term average. Financial conditions globally remained accommodative. In the United States, market reaction to the decision by the Federal Reserve not to scale back the rate of its asset purchases, together with the more positive Chinese data, saw the Australian dollar appreciate over recent weeks, although on a trade-weighted basis the exchange rate remained around 10 per cent lower than in April. ", " Recent data for the domestic economy had confirmed that, as expected, overall growth had been below trend. Non-mining investment had remained subdued, as businesses had been reluctant to take on new risks, and mining investment had turned down. Growth of household consumption had been below average, consistent with subdued conditions in the labour market and softer growth of wages. Consumer confidence was above average levels and business confidence had increased, although it remained to be seen if this would be sustained. ", " The effect of low interest rates was evident across a range of indicators and had further to run. House prices and turnover had increased and leading indicators pointed to a pick-up in dwelling investment over the period ahead. While credit growth remained moderate, there were signs of an increased appetite for borrowing, most notably among investors. ", " The information to hand at the meeting was consistent with growth of economic activity remaining below trend over the next year or so before an expected pick-up. Inflation was expected to be consistent with the target over the next one to two years. Members noted two developments over the past month, namely the appreciation of the exchange rate and the pick-up in measures of both consumer and business confidence over recent weeks. It was difficult to know how significant the effects of either of these developments would be, partly because it was uncertain whether they would be sustained. ", " The Board's judgement was that, given the substantial degree of policy stimulus that had been imparted, it would be prudent to leave the cash rate at the existing low level while continuing to gauge the effects. Members agreed that the Bank should again neither close off the possibility of reducing rates further nor signal an imminent intention to reduce them. The Board would continue to examine the data over the months ahead to assess whether monetary policy was appropriately configured.

In addition, there had been a decline in inflation across much of the globe in recent months. ", " In China, economic activity appeared to be expanding at a steady pace, driven by strong investment growth, with both infrastructure and real estate investment continuing to grow strongly. Conditions in the residential property market remained buoyant in April, although members observed that recently announced controls could weigh on activity in coming months, depending on how widely and strictly they were enforced. ", " Available indicators suggested that the US economy was continuing on a path of moderate growth. Household consumption was being supported by improving conditions in the housing and labour markets. However, recent indicators suggested that conditions in the manufacturing sector had been somewhat subdued in April and May. ", " Members noted that the euro area remained in recession, with output falling in most countries in the March quarter. More timely data indicated that economic conditions remained weak. ", " Growth in the Japanese economy picked up in the March quarter and indicators of activity pointed to continued growth in April. This was consistent with the increased optimism following the announcement of additional fiscal and monetary policy measures since late last year. In the rest of east Asia, growth of domestic final demand had been reasonably stable in recent quarters. Some indicators, such as capital imports, had recently picked up. ", " Over the past month, the spot price for iron ore had fallen further, unwinding the sharp increase around the turn of the year, and the spot price for coking coal had also declined. In contrast, prices for thermal coal, base metals and rural commodities had showed little change. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The limited data for the Australian economy released over the previous month had been mixed, with indicators for the household sector generally remaining stronger than those for the business sector. With the March quarter national accounts scheduled for release the day after the Board meeting, members were briefed on the indicators that were available at the time of the meeting. These suggested that economic activity had grown at close to, or a little below, trend pace in the March quarter, consistent with growth over the year being a bit below trend. However, members noted that this estimate remained subject to the usual degree of uncertainty. ", " Exports had grown further in the March quarter. Resources exports, particularly of bulk commodities, had grown strongly over the past year, while services exports had resumed growth more recently. ", " Available information indicated that business investment had declined in the March quarter. According to the latest ABS capital expenditure survey, the decline had been in both the mining and non-mining sectors. The fall in capital imports since the beginning of the year was consistent with a decline in investment in the first quarter, although recent data showed that capital imports had bounced back somewhat in April. ", " According to the ABS survey of firms' capital expenditure plans, non-mining investment was expected to show moderate growth over the next year or so. While the survey also continued to imply further growth in mining investment, in the past actual annual capital expenditure by mining companies had often differed by a wide margin from their forecasts as reflected in the ABS survey. Based on public statements by mining companies and information from the Bank's liaison, it seemed likely that mining investment was near its peak but would probably remain at a high level for the next year or so. However, members observed that there was considerable uncertainty about mining investment beyond that period. In particular, changes in production and exports of energy commodities in other countries were making it more difficult to assess the potential for new projects in the gas sector in Australia. Overall, conditions in the business sector remained somewhat subdued, with survey measures for all industries at, or below, average levels. ", " Household spending appeared to have picked up early in 2013, after having slowed late in 2012 and having been supported by higher asset prices. In the March quarter, growth of retail sales volumes was strong across most categories, amid a decline in retail prices. Liaison suggested that the pace of retail spending might have eased somewhat more recently, while measures of consumer confidence fell back to around average levels in May. ", " Members observed that the effects of low interest rates had been evident in a range of housing market indicators. Building approvals for both higher-density and detached dwellings had increased over recent months. The Bank's liaison contacts were generally becoming more positive about the outlook for dwelling investment. Also, loan approvals had grown more strongly in recent months, including for new housing, and auction clearance rates were well above average in Sydney and had picked up to be a bit above average in Melbourne. While measures of dwelling prices had been relatively flat over recent months, they were still higher than the previous year. ", " Labour market conditions remained somewhat subdued. The monthly employment data continued to be volatile, with a large increase in employment in April following a sizeable decrease in March. Looking through this volatility, employment growth had not been as fast as growth of the labour force, which had led to the unemployment rate drifting higher over the past year, to 5½ per cent. Job advertisements had stabilised earlier in the year, but had edged down in recent months. Overall, leading indicators of employment pointed to continued moderate employment growth. ", " The wage price index had increased by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter, a little less than had been expected, and year-ended wage growth was below the average of the past decade. The easing in wage growth had been broad based across industries and states, with notable declines in areas related to the mining sector. While the decline in the pace of wage growth in recent quarters had been most pronounced in the private sector, growth in public sector wages continued to slow in the March quarter and remained relatively subdued, consistent with ongoing fiscal restraint. ", " The Australian Government's budget was tabled in May. Members noted that the profile for the fiscal impact over coming years was broadly in line with the assumptions underpinning the forecasts for growth published in the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. "], "Financial Markets": [" Developments in international financial markets over the past month were largely driven by uncertainty about the likely effects over time of the Bank of Japan's recent policy announcement and whether the US Federal Reserve was approaching a turning point in its monetary policy cycle. ", " In Japan, financial market participants had been weighing up two competing forces: the direct, downward pressure on yields from bond purchases by the Bank of Japan versus the upward pressure from expectations that these purchases would succeed in reflating the economy. The net result had been a marked increase in volatility and higher bond yields in Japan. Members noted that, while Japanese investors had shifted out of bonds and into equities, there had been little evidence to date of a shift into foreign bonds. Nonetheless, if it occurred, such a shift had the potential to affect Australian foreign exchange and debt markets. Despite Japanese investors allocating a relatively small share of their holdings of foreign debt securities to Australia, the absolute value of this allocation was large relative to the size of both Australian debt markets and capital inflows. ", " In the United States, 10-year Treasury yields had risen by around 50 basis points during May, mainly reflecting the uncertainty about a possible turning point in the US monetary policy cycle. In this context, members discussed the possibility of further substantial increases in yields on US Treasuries, and noted the increase that had occurred in 1994, which was associated with the Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy during that period. ", " Members noted that a number of other central banks had reduced their policy rates during May, including the European Central Bank, which had lowered its policy rate to 50 basis points. Members also observed that spreads in peripheral European markets had fallen to their lowest level in two to three years, and Portugal had been able to issue its first new bond since early 2011. Yields on sub-investment grade corporate bonds had fallen further, with yields for most classes of corporate bonds reaching record lows. ", " In Australia, yields on Commonwealth Government securities had risen, but by less than yields on US Treasuries. Spreads and yields on Australian corporate bonds were broadly unchanged over the month and, in common with those in other countries, remained at low levels. ", " Members noted that most equity markets had continued to rise over the past month. Despite a sharp fall in late May and early June, the Japanese market remained around 50 per cent higher than in November 2012 at the time the Japanese elections were announced. Equity markets elsewhere had generally showed small gains over the past month. However, the Australian equity market had declined, with share prices for some companies falling in response to profit warnings. Share prices of Australian banks had retraced the significant increases recorded earlier in the month, which had followed their positive earnings reports. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had appreciated further against most currencies over the past month, with the Chinese renminbi a notable exception. The appreciation of the US dollar had mostly reflected changing expectations about US monetary policy. In that regard, an important contributor to the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar had been the US dollar's appreciation. Members noted, however, that the Australian dollar had depreciated against most currencies, reflecting further declines in commodity prices and market concerns about the outlook for China, as well as the reduction in the cash rate in May. Over the past month, the exchange rate had depreciated by around 5 per cent in trade-weighted terms and it was around 8 per cent below the historical high reached in early April. ", " Following the Board's decision in May to reduce the cash rate target by 25 basis points, most lenders in Australia had subsequently lowered their standard variable housing rates in line with the reduction in the cash rate. This resulted in lending rates for most households and businesses reaching or approaching historic lows. ", " Members noted that current market pricing in Australia indicated little expectation of a change in the cash rate at the June meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Data on global economic activity released over the past month had been broadly consistent with earlier forecasts of around average growth in Australia's major trading partners this year, with growth picking up gradually thereafter. Prices of some bulk commodities had declined further in the past month and global inflation had eased somewhat. Financial conditions internationally remained very accommodative. ", " For the domestic economy, the best estimate was that growth had been a bit below trend over the past four quarters. Most recent data were consistent with earlier forecasts of this continuing in the near term. Mining investment appeared to be close to its peak and was expected to remain at a high level for the next year or so, although the exact profile was difficult to predict. Exports of bulk commodities had been growing strongly, and this was expected to continue for some time given the large amount of investment recently completed and currently underway. ", " Conditions in the non-mining business sector remained subdued. Survey measures of conditions and investment intentions, together with only modest growth in business debt, suggested that non-mining business investment would remain subdued in the near term. Nonetheless, the latest ABS survey of firms' investment intentions for 2013/14 indicated that modest growth in non-mining business investment was likely over the course of the year ahead. ", " There were also signs that the appetite for borrowing in the household sector was picking up, and the housing market generally appeared to be improving, as the effects of the most recent and earlier reductions in the cash rate worked their way through the economy. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand were consistent with further moderate growth in employment. Wages growth had slowed over recent quarters, which would help to contain inflation as the exchange rate depreciated. ", " Interest rates had declined further as a result of the Board's decision at the May meeting. The exchange rate had also depreciated noticeably, though it remained at a high level considering the decline in export prices that had taken place over the past year and a half. It was possible that the exchange rate would depreciate further over time as the terms of trade declined, which would help to foster a rebalancing of growth in the economy. ", " At this meeting, members viewed the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate for the time being. The Board also judged that the inflation outlook as currently assessed might provide some scope for further easing, should that be required to support demand.

Total social financing flows had picked up after slowing in the middle of the year. The Japanese economy continued to grow, although on the basis of recent data at a slower rate than the relatively strong pace seen in the first half of the year. The latest indicators suggested that investment in Japan had begun to pick up. In the rest of east Asia, growth had continued at around its decade-average pace, while conditions remained fairly subdued in India. ", " Members noted that the US economy appeared to have been growing at a moderate pace (although several data releases had been delayed by the partial shutdown of the US federal government in the first half of October). The increase in payrolls had been a bit lower over recent months than earlier in the year. In addition, while house prices had risen further, housing starts and mortgage applications for purchases had declined since earlier in the year. The government shutdown was expected to reduce growth only slightly in the December quarter. Economic activity in the euro area had continued to recover, albeit at a moderate pace. Indicators of retail spending and sentiment had improved, but remained at subdued levels. ", " The Board noted that the updated staff forecasts for global growth were little changed from those three months earlier. Growth in Australia's major trading partners in 2013 was expected to be slightly below its decade average of around 4 per cent, before picking up to be slightly above average in 2014. ", " Overall, global commodity prices had increased slightly over the past month. Iron ore prices had been supported by strong growth in Chinese steel production. Thermal coal prices had increased of late but were well below levels of recent years. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that information that became available over the past month was consistent with the Australian economy continuing to expand at a below-trend pace in the September quarter. At the same time, forward-looking indicators had generally improved. ", " Growth in household spending looked to have remained below average in the September quarter, consistent with softness in the labour market weighing on income growth. However, retail sales had strengthened through the September quarter and there were reports from liaison of further growth in October. Motor vehicle sales increased further in the September quarter. In addition, measures of consumer sentiment were well above long-run average levels, following sharp increases in September. ", " Members noted that conditions in the housing market continued to strengthen. Nationally, dwelling prices were above their late 2010 peak, with prices over the three months to October increasing significantly in Sydney. Housing turnover and loan approvals had picked up noticeably. Improved conditions in the established housing market were providing an impetus to dwelling investment, with residential building approvals increasing over the year. Approvals increased notably in September, driven by a pick-up in high-density approvals, which tend to be quite volatile from one month to the next. In discussion, members observed that developments in the established housing market and the increase in new dwelling activity seen to date were among the expected effects of the low level of interest rates. ", " Survey-based measures of business confidence, and some timely measures of business conditions, had increased markedly over the past two months. However, it was too early to tell whether this improvement would signal a willingness of businesses to take on new risks and thereby add to employment and investment. Indicators of current conditions in the non-mining sector remained mixed. Non-residential building approvals were above levels of a year earlier. However, members noted that office vacancy rates had risen to relatively high levels and that the decline in government employment was likely to weigh on demand for office space in some markets. While investment in the mining industry had declined, resources exports, particularly of iron ore, had been growing strongly as more projects were completed. ", " Labour market conditions remained soft. There had been little growth in employment since earlier in the year, although the unemployment rate had been relatively stable over recent months with the participation rate declining. At the same time, the trend in total hours worked remained quite positive and there were recent signs that a number of forward-looking indicators of employment growth were no longer declining. ", " CPI inflation picked up in the September quarter, to 1.0 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, although the year-ended rate declined slightly to 2.2 per cent as the initial effect of the introduction of the carbon price in the September quarter 2012 was no longer in the year-ended rate. The various measures of underlying inflation were between ½ and ¾ per cent in the quarter, which was a touch higher than had been expected, and a little above 2¼ per cent over the year. ", " Prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) rose in the quarter. A pick-up in tradable food prices accounted for much of the increase while prices of consumer durables declined further, although at a slower pace than in recent quarters. Overall, based on historical experience, it was likely that the effect of the exchange rate depreciation earlier in the year was yet to be seen in most tradable consumer prices. Non-tradables inflation had been relatively stable in recent quarters at a rate a little below its average over the past decade. ", " The Board discussed staff forecasts for the domestic economy, which had been revised reflecting several influences. The exchange rate had appreciated somewhat over the past three months and the fall in mining investment was expected to be larger than previously expected. Public demand was also expected to be quite weak. Working in the other direction, there had been an improvement in housing market conditions and a pick-up in measures of business and consumer confidence. GDP growth was expected to remain below trend, at close to 2½ per cent, through the next year. Growth was then expected to pick up to above trend by the end of 2015. ", " The outlook for the labour market over the next two years was slightly weaker than at the time of the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, consistent with revisions to the GDP forecast. The forecast was for employment growth to be below population growth in the near term and for the unemployment rate to continue to increase gradually for the next year or so, before beginning to decline later in the forecast period as non-resources activity picked up. ", " Staff forecasts for inflation were little changed, with small influences from a slightly higher-than-expected outcome for the September quarter, softer conditions in the labour market and a higher exchange rate. The subdued outlook for the labour market implied that domestically generated inflationary pressures were likely to remain contained. Despite the recent appreciation, the exchange rate had depreciated in net terms since earlier in the year, with the result that rising import prices were expected to exert an upward influence on tradables prices in coming quarters (but by less than was expected three months earlier when the exchange rate was lower still). In year-ended terms, the central forecast was for underlying inflation to remain consistent with the inflation target over the forecast period. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial markets with a focus on the United States. While uncertainty about raising the debt ceiling had attracted considerable attention during October, members noted that the impact on financial markets was primarily confined to the short-term money market in the United States. Yields on short-term US government debt rose by up to 50 basis points as investors were concerned that payment on these securities would be delayed. In the event, these effects were largely reversed after Congress passed last-minute legislation to continue to fund spending and suspend the debt ceiling, but only until early in 2014. ", " Members observed that, in contrast, longer-term yields and equity prices in the major financial markets had been relatively unaffected. Prices in major equity markets fell modestly in the lead-up to the US debt ceiling being reached, but subsequently rallied on the markets' assessment that events had reduced the likelihood of the Federal Reserve scaling back its asset-purchase program this year. This expectation was further strengthened by weaker-than-expected US employment data for September, with the US equity market rising to a record high subsequently. Members noted that the Australian equity market had also increased, to its highest level in five years. ", " The changed expectations about the path of US monetary policy during October also further eased pressures in the emerging market economies, with a continued unwinding of the sharp rise in bond yields that had occurred between late May and August. ", " The currencies of Brazil, India and other emerging economies had appreciated from their recent low points, while foreign exchange markets generally were more subdued through October. Volatility in foreign exchange markets declined further over the course of the month, despite the uncertainty over the US fiscal position. As expectations of the timing of asset purchase ‘tapering’ by the Federal Reserve were gradually pushed back, the US dollar tended to depreciate against other major currencies and on a trade-weighted basis, although this move was largely reversed later in October. The Australian dollar was little changed in trade-weighted terms over the month. Members noted that the exchange rate was around 5 per cent higher than its trough in early August and 10 per cent below its peak in April. ", " Members devoted time to review data on capital flows to and from Australia. They noted that net capital flows into Australia over the past couple of decades – which were the counterpart to the current account deficits – had mostly been inflows into private sector assets, but the composition of these flows had changed quite substantially over the past five years. In contrast to past patterns, most of the private capital flows into Australia since the onset of the global financial crisis had been to the non-financial sector, rather than the financial sector (mainly banks), with much of that representing inflows into the resources sector, which had funded the recent high level of investment in that sector. ", " Members were briefed on the most recent ABS survey of foreign currency hedging practices by Australian entities, which was released in late October, and noted that the results were similar to those reported in previous surveys. In particular, Australian entities continued to have more foreign liabilities than assets but most of these liabilities were denominated in Australian dollars and much of the remainder was hedged, which meant that Australian entities as a whole had a positive net foreign currency asset position. A further breakdown of sectoral foreign currency exposures indicated that, after hedging, Australian banks had minimal unhedged foreign currency positions. ", " Bond issuance by Australian banks totalled $4 billion in October but, after accounting for maturing bonds and buybacks of government-guaranteed bonds, net bank bond issuance had actually been negative in the month, which continued the decline in the stock of bonds that had commenced in March this year. This outcome reflected both the restructuring of bank balance sheets in favour of deposit funding as well as only moderate demand for credit. On the other hand, Australian non-financial corporations had recorded solid issuance of corporate debt in 2013 and there had also been higher issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities. ", " Members concluded their discussion of financial markets with the observation that market interest rates currently implied that no change was expected in monetary policy at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Recent data had been consistent with growth of Australia's major trading partners remaining around its long-term average. Growth was expected to pick up to be slightly above average in 2014. Global financial conditions remained very accommodative and volatility in financial markets had abated. ", " Recent indicators suggested that the Australian economy had been expanding at a below-trend pace. The revised staff forecasts suggested that growth in the near term would be constrained by the decline in mining investment, the high level of the exchange rate and weak public demand. A range of indicators showed that dwelling investment was picking up and this was likely to continue. In time, non-resources business investment was also expected to increase given the low level of interest rates and recent substantial increases in measures of business confidence and conditions. Members noted that while the timing of investment upturns was very difficult to predict, it appeared likely that growth of the economy over the coming year would be below trend but that growth could reasonably be expected to pick up thereafter. ", " At recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged while continuing to gauge the effects, including in the housing market, of the substantial degree of monetary policy stimulus that had been put in place over the past two years. There was mounting evidence that monetary policy was supporting activity in interest-sensitive sectors and asset values, and given the lags with which monetary policy operates, the stimulatory effects would likely continue coming through for some time. At the same time, inflation remained within the target and the Australian dollar, while below its level earlier in the year, remained uncomfortably high. Members noted that a lower level of the exchange rate would likely be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy. ", " The Board's judgement was that, given the substantial degree of policy stimulus that had been imparted, it was prudent to hold the cash rate steady while continuing to gauge the effects, but not to close off the possibility of reducing it further should that be appropriate to support sustainable growth in economic activity, consistent with the inflation target. The Board would continue to examine the data over the months ahead to assess whether monetary policy remained appropriate. "], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent."]}},
{"Date": ["Melbourne – 1 April 2008"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Ric Battellino (Deputy Governor), Ken Henry AC (Secretary to the Treasury), John Akehurst, Jillian Broadbent AO, Roger Corbett AM, Graham Kraehe AO, Donald McGauchie AO, Warwick McKibbin "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Malcolm Edey (Assistant Governor, Economic) ", " David Emanuel (Secretary), Anthony Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The Board's discussion of the world economy commenced with a briefing on the global growth outlook. The latest IMF forecasts were for growth in world GDP to be around 3¾ per cent in both 2008 and 2009, following expansion of around 5 per cent in the previous two years. While these IMF forecasts had been marked down by about ½ percentage point for each year from those published in January, they were in line with staff forecasts for Australia's major trading partners made earlier in the year. They implied that the global economic downturn would be relatively mild compared with earlier episodes. The main driver of the slowing in growth was the weakness of the US economy and to some extent the other G7 economies. Good growth was still expected for the emerging economies, in particular China and other east Asian economies, albeit slower than in earlier years. Members discussed the relative importance of trade and financial linkages in transmitting economic developments from one country to another. ", " Turning to the United States, data on employment and retail sales in the past few months indicated that the economy was experiencing a downturn in line with those forecasts. Retail sales growth had slowed to 2½ per cent over the year to February, a similar growth rate to that seen in 2001/02, when the US economy went into a mild recession. Housing construction activity had continued to weaken and house prices were still falling. The main source of growth in the economy was exports, which were being stimulated by the low level of the US dollar exchange rate. ", " Economic growth in China had continued to be very strong, with industrial production still expanding by over 15 per cent per annum. Interpreting data on activity in the past few months had been made difficult by the timing of the Chinese New Year, but there was little sign of any slowing in the pace of growth. Inflation in China was rising significantly, mainly because of higher food prices. ", " Information on other economies in east Asia suggested that they grew in the early part of 2008, with strength in both industrial production and merchandise exports. Exports to the United States had slowed, but this had been more than offset by increased exports to other markets. Members noted that, as in China, increasing inflationary pressures were an emerging problem in several east Asian economies. ", " In Europe, members observed that there had been a slowing in the pace of economic activity, but not as marked as in the United States. Year-ended growth in industrial production had eased to around 2½ per cent and consumer and business confidence had continued to decline from the peaks in mid 2007; notably, business confidence remained well above its long-run average. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members discussed the national accounts for the December quarter, which had been released the day after the previous meeting. The accounts confirmed that demand and output had increased strongly in 2007. GDP rose by 3.9 per cent over the year, with non-farm GDP rising slightly faster. The growth in domestic demand was much faster, at 5.7 per cent over the year, and had been met partly by rapidly rising imports, which reflected pressures on domestic productive capacity as well as the high exchange rate. Members noted that this was an environment conducive to rising inflation. ", " The strength exhibited in the national accounts was consistent with the picture of a strong economy coming from employment data. This was in contrast to the position a couple of years earlier, when relatively weak GDP and strong labour market indicators had been giving conflicting signals. ", " Members then reviewed information provided by the run of more timely data releases, covering household consumption, the housing and business sectors, commodity prices and the labour market. ", " Retail sales were flat in January, following large increases over the course of 2007. The staff's liaison with retailers, which had been stepped up over the recent period, suggested that sales had been flat in the March quarter as a whole. Consumer sentiment had fallen sharply over the past few months, most likely reflecting tighter financial conditions and the financial market turmoil more generally. Motor vehicle sales had fallen in February, but it was not yet clear whether this marked a break from the strongly rising trend over the past two years. Members noted that rising sales of motor vehicles had not been matched by increased domestic production; the latter had remained fairly steady over the past decade, with a growing share of demand being met by imports. ", " Discussion turned to the housing sector. Members noted that activity had continued to be flat into the early part of 2008, after several years of little growth. Housing finance had softened in the past few months. Loan approvals as a proportion of housing credit outstanding were the lowest for some years and appeared to have fallen further in February, according to estimates based on bank lending. There were little reliable data on developments in house prices in the March quarter, though clearance rates had fallen in the major auction markets of Sydney and Melbourne in recent months. ", " In the business sector, investment had increased by 8 per cent over the year to the December quarter, in a continuation of the strong growth recorded since 2001. Mining investment was the fastest-growing sector over the past few years, but other sectors had also recorded large increases. Overall, the level of investment was adding to the nation's capital stock at a higher-than-average pace, which would help to boost growth of the economy's productive capacity. The latest capital expenditure survey pointed to strong investment plans in 2008/09, though members anticipated that some scaling back of these plans could occur in the period ahead. ", " Business surveys showed some divergence. According to the NAB survey, the business conditions index, reflecting activity and sales, remained above average levels in February, although confidence about the general business outlook had fallen well below average. ", " Members observed that commodity prices had been volatile in the first quarter of 2008. Prices for several commodities, including base metals and crude oil, had risen early in the year, then fluctuated below their early March peaks. The spot coal price had come off its peak somewhat, but the increase in the contract price for this year was still likely to be substantial. ", " All up, the terms of trade were expected to increase by around 15 per cent in the middle of 2008, based on the likely increases in contract prices for the bulk commodities of coal and iron ore. The ensuing large rise in Australian incomes would impart a significant stimulus to the economy. ", " Turning to the labour market and wages, members observed that there had been no sign of slowing in employment growth, which had been steady at just below 3 per cent in year-ended terms for the past year or so. Job vacancies, as measured by the ABS survey of employers, fell slightly in the three months to February but remained very high, confirming the current tightness of the labour market. ", " Despite the sustained strength of the labour market, wages growth remained reasonably contained, with the spike in the average earnings figures for the year to the September quarter falling away in the subsequent quarter. Looking through the volatility, growth in average earnings appeared to have picked up only modestly over the past few years. In other wages data, there had been no pick-up in the pace of wages growth associated with recent new enterprise agreements, leaving the rate of growth of wages in current enterprise agreements steady at 4 per cent during 2007. ", " Members were informed that the CPI data for the March quarter, to be released towards the end of April, were likely to show inflation of around 4 per cent on a year-ended basis in the March quarter. A large quarterly increase was expected partly because of recent rises in retail petrol prices. Underlying inflation was also expected to rise in year-ended terms in the March quarter, before declining over time. The staff's inflation forecast through to 2010 would be revised after the release of the March quarter CPI, but the preliminary assessment, based on current policy settings, was that inflation on both a CPI and underlying basis would fall by a little more than earlier thought over the next two to three years. This was premised on demand growth slowing sufficiently to reduce capacity pressures. Members recognised that a considerable degree of uncertainty continued to surround the outlook for both demand and inflation. "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board noted that there had been substantial volatility in financial markets over the past month. Much of the latest bout of volatility was the consequence of the process of de-leveraging, notably by hedge funds, which had faced margin calls and subsequently needed to sell assets. It also reflected the near-collapse of Bear Stearns, an investment bank that had been at the centre of the financial crisis since mid 2007, and its rescue through a take-over by JPMorgan Chase, facilitated by the Federal Reserve assuming some of the risk in the Bear Stearns portfolio. ", " Information on the US mortgage market showed that delinquencies, defined as loans that were 30 days or more overdue, and foreclosures had continued to rise. This was reflected in both sub-prime and prime loans, though foreclosures were far higher on sub-prime than prime loans. ", " Turning to financial market conditions more generally, there had been a tightening of conditions in the market for term paper, peaking around the time of the rescue of Bear Stearns, but this had since eased somewhat. However, conditions remained tight in short-term money markets. Partly, this reflected end-quarter balance-sheet adjustments. The G10 central banks had announced co-ordinated action to increase US dollar swap lines between the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank, which was similar to action taken in December 2007. The Fed had also announced significant changes to its framework for domestic market operations, which extended the list of counterparties with which it dealt and the collateral that it would accept. These changes did not involve any significant net injection of liquidity to the system, but gave additional flexibility for providing liquidity when it was needed. ", " Members discussed the process of de-leveraging, which was evident in many financial markets. Among those affected was the European government bond market, where spreads between yields on German government bonds and those on bonds of several other countries had widened sharply in March as liquidity dried up. ", " Volatility in share prices had also continued to be very high. Net movements in share prices around the world in March had been modest, however, with small falls in most markets apart from Japan, where share prices had fallen by a larger amount owing to the effect of the appreciating yen on listed Japanese exporters. Share prices in China, India and other emerging economies had fallen sharply over the past month. Financial stocks globally had fallen more than other stocks, and were now back to 2005 levels. Reflecting the high weighting of financial stocks in the Australian share market, it had fallen by more than most other share markets since its peak in November 2007. Traditional measures of price-earnings ratios in Australia were now below longer-run averages. ", " Members noted that, in addition to its other actions, the Fed had cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points at its March meeting, to 2.25 per cent. This took the total reduction to 300 basis points over the past six months. The market expected further small reductions in the next few months. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank had continued to hold its policy setting steady, highlighting ongoing inflation risks. Policy rates were also steady in Japan and the UK, but had been cut by 50 basis points in Canada. There had been further policy tightening in China, though policy settings in other emerging economies were generally steady. ", " Members noted the large movements in currencies over the past month. In terms of movements against the US dollar, the yen was at its highest level since 1995 and the euro had reached a new high. The euro was at a high in real effective terms also. The US dollar had depreciated sharply in real effective terms, and on this measure was close to the lows recorded over the past two decades. The renminbi had continued to appreciate gradually against the US dollar, but depreciate against the euro. Owing to relatively high inflation in China compared with its main trading partners, the renminbi had risen in real effective terms over the past two years. ", " The Australian dollar had experienced large swings over the past month. Intraday volatility was among the highest in recent years, against both the US dollar and the yen. Over the past month, in trade-weighted terms the Australian dollar exchange rate fell by 4 per cent, with depreciation against most currencies in the basket, particularly the yen and the Swiss franc. Over the year, however, the Australian dollar TWI was about 4 per cent higher; over a longer period, the TWI was currently about 15 per cent above its post-float average. ", " In the domestic money market, members noted the 90-day bank bill rate had peaked above 8 per cent during the month, a very large spread to the expected cash rate, but had fallen since mid March to be around 7¾ per cent. The Bank had increased exchange settlement balances during the month and conducted more operations at longer terms, between 90–180 days, where liquidity was needed. There had been no deviation of the cash rate from the target. ", " Members then discussed recent trends in bond issuance by Australian banks, which had continued apace in the first quarter of 2008. The large amount of bond issuance by the banks in part reflected strong growth in balance sheets, owing to the increased corporate demand for bank credit after the drying up of activity in the corporate bond market in Australia. Members observed that the banks had acted as a shock-absorber in terms of corporate funding. The large bond issuance by the banks also reflected a precautionary element. Bond issuance offshore had accounted for the bulk of total issuance. Yields paid by Australian banks on their debt had continued to rise in line with international trends. ", " The further rises in banks' funding costs over the past month had been passed on to borrowers in the form of higher lending rates. Business funding had risen rapidly, partly owing to reintermediation, though there were some signs of slowing in the pace of business credit expansion in February. ", " Members observed that financial results published during the latest corporate reporting season showed that the rise in debt levels among companies had been only modest. ", " Current pricing in the money market indicated that no change in the cash rate was expected at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was to leave the cash rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent. ", " In considering their policy decision, Board members noted that developments in the global economy over the past month were consistent with the world growth forecasts outlined in the previous month. These included weak outcomes for the United States. Growth in the emerging economies looked set to moderate, but remain relatively strong. Overall growth in the world economy in 2008 and 2009 was likely to be below the average of recent years. Downside risks could be identified to growth, though inflation remained a concern in a number of countries. ", " For the Australian economy, information from the December quarter national accounts confirmed that the economy had grown strongly through 2007, driven by rapid growth in domestic spending. The labour market had also remained very strong through to February. However, other recent information, including through liaison sources, provided indications that domestic demand was slowing. Business and consumer sentiment had softened in the early part of 2008, and retail sales had slowed, as had household credit demand. ", " Members noted that the economy continued to be affected by a number of cross-currents. Large increases in real income were likely to flow from further increases in the terms of trade, foreshadowed by recent contract price negotiations for key bulk commodities. On the other hand, the slowing global economy and tighter financial conditions in Australia were likely to reduce expansionary forces on the economy. Members judged that, taking account of the additional rises in funding costs that banks had passed on to borrowers, the current stance of monetary policy was exerting a significant restraining influence on both households and businesses. Further, there had been some tightening in credit standards for more risky borrowers. ", " These developments were working to foster the moderation in demand growth that was needed to ease the pressure on inflation. Provided this moderation continued, members expected inflation to decline over time, though they recognised that there were significant risks in both directions. Members also noted that in the short term inflation was likely to remain relatively high, with both the CPI and underlying measures expected to rise further in year-ended terms in the March quarter. ", " Members decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current setting of monetary policy for the time being, and to continue to evaluate prospects for economic activity and inflation in the light of new information. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent. "]}},

"], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Malcolm Edey (Assistant Governor, Economic) ", " David Emanuel (Secretary), Anthony Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Inflation": [" Board members were briefed on the CPI data for the March quarter 2008. The CPI rose by 1.3 per cent in the quarter and by 4.2 per cent over the year. The various measures of underlying inflation were similar to the CPI over the latest year. The general increase in inflationary pressure was the result of strong growth in domestic demand in the face of limited spare capacity and rapid growth in commodity prices over the past few years. ", " In their discussion, members noted that the increase in prices over the past year had been broadly based, with three-quarters of the items in the CPI basket, by weight, rising faster than 2.5 per cent per annum. Non-tradables prices, mainly comprising services, had picked up noticeably. Tradables prices excluding the volatile components of food and petrol were rising at less than 1 per cent per annum, and had been held down by the effect of the higher exchange rate. International comparisons suggested that inflation in Australia, on both a headline and underlying basis, had for some time been noticeably higher and was now rising more steeply than the average of the G7 economies excluding Japan. This reflected the relatively stronger demand conditions prevailing in Australia in recent years. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members reviewed recent data on the domestic economy, most of which indicated that the pace of activity had slowed since the start of the year. ", " In the case of retail sales, year-ended growth had slowed to 5 per cent in March, from about 8 per cent in December. In volume terms, retail sales fell slightly in the March quarter. Liaison with retailers conducted by the staff indicated that sales of discretionary items had recently been weak. Members also noted that consumer sentiment had fallen well below average in the past few months. Buying conditions, a sub-component of the consumer sentiment measure, had fallen particularly sharply in recent months. ", " Turning to the housing sector, members observed that the level of new building activity was running well below estimates of underlying demand. The early signs of a pick-up in building approvals late in 2007 had since faded. ", " Other indicators, such as auction clearance rates, house prices and housing finance, pointed to activity in the established housing market also softening. ", " The available information suggested that house prices rose only slightly in the March quarter, with weakness in prices in Sydney and Perth offset by increases in prices in Brisbane and Adelaide. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had fallen in recent weeks and were roughly consistent with a continuation of stable house prices. ", " Housing finance had softened further in the past few months. Housing loan approvals as a proportion of housing credit outstanding had fallen significantly in February and another sizeable fall was estimated to have occurred in March, according to bank lending figures. Monthly housing credit growth had slowed to around 0.8 per cent on average since mid 2007, and was likely to fall further in coming months. ", " In the business sector, activity had slowed. On a three-month-ended annualised basis, growth in business borrowing from intermediaries had fallen from over 25 per cent at the end of 2007 to 12 per cent in February. The fall in business credit growth had been preceded by a sharp fall in commercial loan approvals, though this was typically a very volatile series. Members commented that business credit for companies with strong balance sheets was still readily available and spreads had not widened excessively. ", " According to the NAB survey, confidence about the business outlook had fallen over the past year and was now well below average. However, firms' assessment of their own business conditions, reflecting activity and sales, had declined more modestly and remained above average. ", " Turning to the labour market, members noted that employment growth was strong in March, with the year-ended rate of increase remaining at just below 3 per cent. Given that employment lagged developments in economic activity, members judged that it was too soon to expect to see much effect in these data of the slowing in the wider economy. "], "Commodity Prices and the Terms of Trade": [" Members were briefed on the large increases in bulk commodity contract prices that had been agreed over the past month. In US dollar terms, there were price rises of 80 per cent for iron ore, over 200 per cent for coking coal and 125 per cent for thermal coal. Other commodity prices were also high at present. The price of Tapis crude oil had risen steadily so far this year, and base metals prices were not far below the peak reached in mid 2007 after having roughly doubled over the previous three years. ", " The rises in bulk commodity contract prices were significantly higher than previously forecast and would lead to an estimated rise in the terms of trade of 20 per cent this year. The increase in the terms of trade was expected to boost national income by about 3–4 per cent, which would be a significant potential stimulus to spending, notwithstanding possible constraints inhibiting a further rise in business and public-sector investment spending. Members were informed that, measured by the change in the terms of trade over the past five years, Australia had received a larger income gain than any other comparable country, even before taking this year's projected increase into account. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The Board's discussion of the world economy began with the United States, where GDP had been quite weak; there was little growth in the December and March quarters. As a consequence, employment had fallen in recent months, including a modest fall in April. Housing starts had fallen further in March and continued to exert a considerable drag on overall growth. The low level of residential building activity meant that excess stocks of unsold new houses were being worked off, but the adjustment was slow and had some way to go. ", " In China, economic growth had continued to be very strong, though it had moderated slightly in the early part of 2008 as exports had slowed. The Japanese economy was slowing, according to a range of indicators of business and consumer sentiment. Elsewhere in east Asia, there were few signs of slowing. Growth in industrial production and merchandise exports for the region as a whole had, if anything, strengthened further over recent months. Members discussed the fact that inflation seemed to be an increasing problem in Asia. ", " In the euro area, growth in industrial production and measures of consumer and business confidence had peaked in mid 2007 and since then there had been a slowing in the pace of economic activity. Growth in the United Kingdom had also moderated, according to GDP data for the March quarter, though this was relatively mild. "], "The Outlook": [" Members were informed that the staff forecast for world economic growth had not changed over the past month. Growth in the GDP of Australia's trading partners was expected to be a little below 4 per cent in both 2008 and 2009. ", " Following a review of the forecasts for domestic economic growth and inflation after the release of the CPI for the March quarter, the staff now expected non-farm GDP growth to slow to 1¾ per cent over the course of 2008. Subsequently, non-farm GDP growth was expected to increase over the rest of the forecast period, but remain below trend. This slowing in GDP reflected much weaker growth in domestic demand. This, in turn, was the net outcome of significant opposing forces: weaker world growth and tighter domestic financial conditions (some of which were due to difficulties in financial markets) were likely to moderate growth, while the strong rise in incomes resulting from the terms of trade would boost demand. ", " The forecast for inflation was for both the headline and underlying measures to remain above 4 per cent through to late 2008. Thereafter, inflation was expected to decline steadily to about 2¾ per cent by the end of 2010. The forecast decline in inflation was driven by the easing of capacity strains as a result of below-trend growth in non-farm GDP. ", " In discussing the outlook, members noted that there was considerable uncertainty in the forecasts for demand, production and inflation, given the nature and size of the opposing forces operating on the economy at present. "], "Financial Markets": ["<p id=\"Body\"> Members examined the improvement in sentiment in financial markets that had been apparent over the past month. A summary indicator of the improvement was the narrowing of credit default swap spreads from the peaks reached at the time of the rescue of US investment bank Bear Stearns. However, spreads were still higher than in the second half of 2007. ", " Reporting of first-quarter earnings by a number of global banks had again been accompanied by announcements of large write-downs, but at the same time there had been substantial capital raisings. In some cases, these had been oversubscribed. ", " In another sign of more favourable financial market conditions over the past month, global share prices, including financial stocks, recovered from their troughs in mid March. Members noted that first-quarter US corporate earnings were not as weak as had been expected by analysts. The Australian share market also rose over the month, with a sharp rise in resources stocks. ", " In contrast to the general improvement in sentiment in financial markets, conditions in money markets in the major economies remained strained. Spreads in these markets had risen in April despite significant changes to operating procedures by central banks in the United States and United Kingdom, in particular. These involved dealing at longer maturities, transacting with a wider range of counterparties and accepting a broader range of collateral. ", " Members observed that while there had been ongoing strains in money markets in the major economies, the position in Australia was more settled, and there was a general sense that funding conditions domestically were improving. The three-month LIBOR to swap spread in the Australian market was now back at the low end of the international range, which had been the situation for most of the period since the onset of the financial crisis. The Bank had reduced aggregate daily exchange settlement balances to below $2 billion from the level of over $5 billion reached at the end of the March quarter. During the past month, the Bank had on occasion dealt at longer-than-usual maturities and had accepted residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) under repurchase agreements. This provided some support for activity in the RMBS market. ", " The Board's discussion then moved to monetary policy settings around the world. It was noted that while three major central banks (the Federal Reserve, Bank of Canada and Bank of England) had reduced policy rates, central banks in many other countries were concerned about inflation. It was also noted that market expectations were that the Fed had now completed the easing process. Most other developed economy central banks had held interest rates steady. Central banks in emerging economies were generally tightening monetary policy. The People's Bank of China, for example, had tightened monetary policy settings again and there had been increases in policy rates in India, Brazil, South Africa and some eastern European countries. ", " Looking at foreign exchange markets, members noted that the US dollar had recovered somewhat from the all-time low against the euro in April, but that it remained near historic lows on a trade-weighted basis. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated against most currencies over the past month. The trade-weighted index had risen by 4 per cent over the month and by about 8 per cent over the past year. Members thought that the rise of the exchange rate over recent months had been less than might have been expected given the strength of commodity prices. ", " In reviewing developments in capital markets, members noted that bond issuance by Australian banks had returned to around average levels over March, April and early May after the very large raisings in the first two months of the year. There were tentative signs that banks' bond spreads, while still high, might have peaked. There had been some corporate issuance in recent weeks, following very little activity in the fourth quarter of 2007. Conditions in the domestic RMBS market also seemed to be improving, following a period in February and March in which there had been a large amount of distressed selling from offshore as portfolios were liquidated. Banks had also been raising funds aggressively through deposits. ", " Interest rates on loans had continued to be raised across the spectrum of products. Housing loan rates had risen by 10–12 basis points in April. Since July 2007, apart from the increases attributable to the cash rate, there had been an additional 40 basis point increase on housing loans and a 55–65 basis point increase on business loans. ", " Members noted that there had been a large fall in margin lending in recent months, concentrated particularly in very large loans. This was an encouraging sign that the excesses of earlier years were starting to be unwound. ", " Current pricing in the money market indicated that no change in the cash rate was expected for the foreseeable future. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was to leave the cash rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent. ", " In considering their decision, Board members noted that there was further evidence that the growth of domestic demand had moderated significantly. Household spending had been subdued over recent months and demand for credit by both households and businesses had weakened. Nevertheless, CPI and underlying inflation had risen further and was uncomfortably high. Price rises had been widespread, in an environment of limited capacity and strong growth in demand in recent years. ", " Financial conditions were now tight, following the rises in the cash rate since mid 2007, the additional market-induced increases in lending rates and the tougher lending standards for some borrowers imposed by lenders in the past few months. ", " Looking ahead, members could see powerful opposing forces affecting the Australian economy. On the one hand, the slowdown in the developed economies, the ongoing strains in world financial markets and tight domestic financial conditions were working to slow demand and activity. Working in the other direction was the larger-than-expected stimulus to domestic incomes from the rising terms of trade that would flow from the very large recent increases in bulk commodity contract prices. Members acknowledged that the net effect of these forces on the prospects for growth and inflation was highly uncertain. ", " Board members noted the importance of reducing inflation if Australia was to avoid a prolonged period of economic difficulty. The staff forecast was that inflation would return to the target by the end of the forecast period in 2010, if the recent slowing in demand was sustained. This would most likely be associated with output growth falling to quite low rates in the year ahead, something that was required to ease pressure on capacity and slow the pass-through by businesses of higher input costs. Even so, members noted that the forecast path for inflation involved it remaining above 4 per cent for much of 2008. This carried the risk that expectations of high ongoing inflation could develop, which could in turn affect price- and wage-setting behaviour. ", " The question therefore remained whether the setting of monetary policy was sufficiently restrictive to secure low inflation over time. Members spent considerable time discussing the case for a further rise in the cash rate. But on balance, given the substantial tightening in financial conditions since mid 2007, and the extent of uncertainty surrounding the outlook, the Board decided that it was appropriate to allow the current setting of monetary policy more time to work. However, should demand not slow as expected or should expectations of high ongoing inflation begin to affect wage and price setting, the outlook, and the stance of policy, would need to be reviewed. The Board would need to evaluate prospects for economic activity and inflation in the light of incoming information.

"], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Malcolm Edey (Assistant Governor, Economic) ", " David Emanuel (Secretary), Anthony Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 4 December 2007 were signed. "], "Inflation": [" Board members were briefed on the CPI data for the December quarter 2007. The quarterly outcome was relatively high at 0.9 per cent, which had lifted the year-ended inflation rate to 3 per cent. There had now been three consecutive high quarterly readings, with the year-ended rate likely to rise further as the price falls associated with falling fruit prices around the beginning of 2007 dropped out of the calculation. In underlying terms, taking an average of the trimmed mean and weighted median measures, year-ended inflation had increased to 3.6 per cent after a period where it had been stable at around 3 per cent. ", " Members took particular note that the increase in prices over the past two years had been broadly based. This was supported by the fact that, over that period, around 70 per cent of items in the CPI by weight had increased at an annual rate of more than 2.5 per cent. Prices of non-tradable items in the CPI had increased by 4½ per cent over the year to the December quarter, continuing the increase seen since mid 2007. Price rises of tradable items, which had generally been held down by international competition in goods markets and a period of exchange rate appreciation earlier in the decade, had picked up gradually over the past two years. Members discussed anecdotal reports of rising cost pressures in China, which might add to inflation in internationally traded goods. They concluded, however, that there was no evidence thus far that Chinese export prices, measured in renminbi, were rising. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The discussion then moved to the world economy, starting with the United States. ", " Members were briefed that US GDP data for the December quarter 2007 indicated growth of only 0.2 per cent in the quarter and 2.5 per cent over the year. Excluding housing construction, year-ended growth was 3½ per cent, which suggested that, in 2007, other parts of the economy had remained resilient. Export growth, in particular, had been strong, helped by the depreciation of the US dollar. ", " The US housing downturn had continued in recent months. Indicators of activity, namely permits to build and housing starts, had fallen further and were approaching the low levels seen in the 1990/91 recession. Although the stock of new unsold homes was falling, sales were falling more rapidly, which implied that the ratio of stocks to sales was still rising. House prices had continued to fall, with the Case-Shiller index of repeat sales in 20 major cities now 9 per cent below the peak in 2006. ", " Members concluded that last year's divergence in economic conditions between housing and other parts of the economy was unusual, and it was likely that the weakness in the housing sector would spread to other sectors as growth in incomes and spending declined. Indicators of business confidence and labour market conditions had recently signalled weakness. ", " Members then noted that recent data in a number of other developed economies had also softened, though developing countries were continuing to do well. ", " In Japan, indicators of sentiment had declined, particularly for consumers and the small business sector. Elsewhere in Asia, growth in China exceeded 11 per cent over 2007 and there was only modest evidence of a slowdown in external trading activity. India had also continued to record high rates of GDP growth during 2007. In Korea, GDP growth had picked up to be more than 5 per cent over the course of 2007, which was around the highest rate seen over recent years. In those economies where recent GDP data were not yet available, industrial production had held up towards the end of 2007. ", " Growth in industrial production in the euro area had continued at a solid pace in the final months of 2007, though indicators of sentiment had declined significantly, notably among consumers. ", " Members examined the IMF's forecast of growth in world GDP in 2008, which had been reduced to 4.1 per cent, following growth of around 5 per cent in both 2006 and 2007. This outlook incorporated significant weakness in the G7 economies, while growth in the developing world was expected to remain relatively strong. The IMF regarded the risks to its latest forecasts as predominantly on the downside. Members noted that the Bank staff forecasts envisaged outcomes for the US and global economies in 2008 that were weaker than forecast by the IMF. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members considered the national accounts for the September quarter 2007, which had been released the day following the previous Board meeting. GDP had increased by 1 per cent in the September quarter, in line with the forecast provided to the Board at the time, and by 4.3 per cent over the year, which incorporated net downward revisions to previous quarters. Various inconsistencies in the economic data that had been apparent a year or two earlier had faded away. The data from a range of sources were now providing a picture of strong growth in output and employment, with high levels of capacity utilisation. ", " Members then turned to their review of recent developments in the domestic economy and considered the information provided by the run of regular data releases, covering business conditions, the household and business sectors, housing, credit growth, external trade, and the labour market and wages. ", " A measure of business conditions from the NAB survey indicated that conditions had remained strong in the December quarter 2007, in line with the preceding few observations. ", " Retail sales increased rapidly in November, and the December figures, which were released during the meeting, were again strong. Year-ended growth had drifted higher though most of 2007 and reached 8½ per cent by December. Sales growth in volume terms was strong for the second consecutive quarter, to be 5.7 per cent higher over the year, the highest rate since 2004. Strength in sales appeared to be concentrated among large retailers, whose sales were rising rapidly. It was noted, however, that consumer sentiment had fallen sharply in January. ", " There was extensive discussion of recent developments in household incomes and spending. Although the data were only to the September quarter 2007, they showed that consumption growth of around 4 per cent over the year had been supported by growth in real household disposable income of around 8 per cent, which was close to the peaks of this series. Adjusting real household disposable income for interest payments lowered the year-ended growth rate only slightly, despite higher debt levels and rises in interest rates over that period. ", " House prices increased further towards the end of 2007, with 3 per cent growth nationwide in the December quarter taking the increase for the year to 12 per cent. Solid growth in the quarter was recorded in all cities except Perth. House prices had reached a plateau in Perth following several years of very rapid growth. The increase in house prices in Sydney of 8 per cent over 2007 had been concentrated in the upper end of the market, with prices at the lower end of the market remaining flat. ", " In discussing the housing market, members noted that building approvals, after having been relatively flat at a level below estimates of underlying demand, had shown tentative signs of a pick-up in the months up to November. However, a large, broad-based fall in December had made the trend in these data difficult to read. It was possible that the decline in December was a response to tighter financial conditions, but it was too early to draw firm conclusions. ", " In contrast, the situation with business investment was very clear. Investment had increased by 10 per cent over the year to the September quarter, in a continuation of the strong growth recorded over the past five years. Mining investment was the fastest-growing sector. With investment having reached a high level measured as a share of GDP, substantial additions to the capital stock were in prospect, which would in time help to boost the economy's productive potential. ", " This strong investment had driven up demand for funds by the business sector. Business credit was growing at 24 per cent, the fastest rate in two decades. Part of the rapid pace of growth was, however, the result of a greater reliance on intermediated finance on the part of borrowers who were having difficulty accessing funds directly in capital markets following the credit crisis. Household credit growth was around 12 per cent over 2007, which was at the lower end of the range in the past decade. There were signs that the household sector was slowing its demand for finance in the face of higher interest rates. Overall, however, total credit growth had picked up towards the end of 2007. ", " Turning to the external sector, members observed that although base metals prices peaked early in 2007 and had declined by around 30 per cent since then, other commodity prices were still rising. Wheat prices, in particular, had increased very rapidly in the second half of 2007. As a consequence of the decline in base metals prices, the terms of trade had fallen somewhat in recent quarters. Members were informed that, with rises in new contract prices for coal and iron ore expected to be significant, the terms of trade were forecast to rise again in the first half of 2008. Thereafter, they were expected to drift lower, reflecting the effect of the expected slowing in world GDP growth. ", " The discussion of the labour market concluded that the market remained tight. Employment rose by 2½ per cent over the course of 2007, and the unemployment rate remained at 30-year lows. Job vacancies in the December quarter, measured as a share of the labour force, were at the highest level in 30 years. Despite the tight conditions in the labour market, the wage price index (WPI) had maintained a steady growth rate of around 4 per cent per annum. Another measure – average earnings per employee from the national accounts – suggested that there had been a noticeable pick-up in wage growth, though this indicator was subject to significant volatility. ", " The outlook for GDP and inflation prepared for the meeting incorporated a slowdown in non-farm GDP growth to 2¾ per cent by the end of 2008, with growth rising to 3 per cent during the following year. GDP growth was expected to be a little higher than that, reflecting the improved conditions assumed for the farm sector during 2008. The staff forecast for underlying inflation, in the absence of any monetary policy tightening, was for it to rise to around 3¾ per cent early in 2008 before gradually declining in response to the forecast slowing in both the world economy and Australia. It was still expected to be above 3 per cent by mid 2010. Year-ended CPI inflation was forecast to rise more sharply in the March quarter 2008, to around 4 per cent, owing to the passing out of the very low figure recorded a year earlier. After that, year-ended CPI inflation was expected to settle broadly into the same trajectory as underlying inflation. There were clearly identifiable risks on both sides of the forecasts for growth and inflation. "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board's discussion of recent developments in financial markets focused on the continuing turbulence and negative sentiment since the previous meeting, characterised by large falls in global share prices, further write-downs by financial institutions and growing pessimism about prospects for the US and world economies. The falls in share prices had been broad based in terms of both the sectors and countries affected. ", " The latest data on the US mortgage market, which related to the September quarter 2007, showed a further large rise in delinquencies on sub-prime loans, to over 16 per cent, as well as a smaller rise in delinquencies on prime loans. A large number of interest-rate resets on sub-prime loans from the 2006 vintage were scheduled to come through this year, although the reduction in US official interest rates had lessened the impact on these borrowers. ", " To date, financial institutions had written off over US$120 billion in losses associated with the sub‑prime crisis. Much of this was by several of the largest US investment banks, whose capital had been replenished by capital injections from sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East. There were still concerns in the market about the capital position of ‘monolines’ and the attendant risk of ratings downgrades. ", " The Federal Reserve had reduced the federal funds rate by 150 basis points, to 3 per cent, since early December. This included a 75 basis point cut in an inter-meeting move in late January. The futures market was pricing in a fed funds rate of 2–2¼ per cent by mid year. ", " The European Central Bank had not adjusted rates and neither had the Bank of Japan. However, the Bank of Canada had lowered rates by 50 basis points, and markets expected further reductions. The Bank of England was also expected to cut rates at its meeting later in the week. ", " There had been a tightening of monetary policy in some emerging market economies, notably China, where the People's Bank of China had continued to tighten a range of policy instruments to combat high inflation. ", " In money markets, members noted that spreads between short-term rates and expected policy interest rates had risen sharply as the year-end approached, but eased just before the end of December, after a co-ordinated announcement by central banks of various measures to ensure the adequate provision of liquidity. These spreads had since fallen back further, but remained well above the levels prevailing prior to the onset of the credit crisis in August. ", " A similar pattern in short-term interest rates had been seen in Australia. The Bank had significantly increased exchange settlement balances towards the end of the year. Although some of this had since been reversed, balances remained above the levels prior to the credit crisis. Members were briefed on the marked change to the composition of the Bank's balance sheet in recent months, driven by a decline in government deposits and the switch in market operations from foreign exchange swaps to domestic repurchase agreements. ", " The continuing decline in US long-term bond yields had not been matched by the falls in yields in other bond markets. Bond yields in Australia were largely unchanged in the past few months, which meant that the spread to the US market was now at 10-year highs. ", " Spreads on US corporate paper had widened but, given the fall in government bond yields, the level of corporate yields was flat to down on investment-grade paper or better. ", " Turning to exchange rates, members' discussion noted that currency markets had been volatile in the past few months. The yen had appreciated and the euro had reached multi-year highs against the US dollar. However, the US dollar had appreciated against some other currencies over the past two months, which implied that the effective exchange rate was little changed, albeit around historical lows. The pace of appreciation of the renminbi had increased significantly in the final quarter of 2007, which was part of the policy response by the People's Bank to restrain inflation in China. ", " The Australian dollar had also traded in a relatively wide range in the recent period and closely tracked the changing sentiment in global financial markets. Average intraday volatility in January had been the highest in over a decade. Measured on the trade-weighted index, the Australian dollar was 2 per cent higher over the past two months and around 9 per cent higher over the past year. ", " The Australian share market had fallen since the start of 2008, following a strong performance in 2007. At one time it had been as much as 24 per cent below the recent domestic peak, but strong rises recently had almost halved the losses. Intraday volatility had been particularly high in the past month; large price movements in both directions had prompted a noticeable increase in margin calls, though leverage had been steady. Share price indices for the commercial banks in Australia had declined by a smaller amount than their peers in the United States since early 2007, but the falls in share prices of Australian investment banks had been of similar magnitudes to those of US investment banks. ", " Looking at developments in capital markets, members observed that corporate and asset-backed bond issuance remained extremely low in recent months. However, banks had continued to raise funds by issuing bonds both offshore and onshore. The cost of raising funds in capital markets had increased significantly compared with costs prevailing up to mid 2007. This had lifted banks' overall cost of funds. ", " Members noted that, while banks' costs had risen, they had been able to continue to expand their balance sheets. The major banks had stepped up their lending to offset reduced lending by intemediaries relying on securitisation for funding and by international investment banks. To date, they had been able to accommodate the increased loan demand by corporates that were facing limited access to capital markets. Members discussed the possibility that funding and capital constraints on banks might, at some point, result in their restricting lending growth. ", " The increases in funding costs led banks to increase margins on business loans in December and housing loans in January. Business lending rates had continued to rise during the past month or so in response to increases in bank bill yields. ", " Members noted that, following release of the December quarter CPI, pricing in the money market had attached a high probability to a monetary policy tightening at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points to 7 per cent. ", " In debating this recommendation, members agreed that a key issue was that inflation had increased, and was running at a higher pace than had been expected prior to the release of the December quarter CPI. On a year-ended basis, CPI inflation would rise further in the March quarter. Members took note of the staff forecast that inflation was likely to moderate somewhat during 2009 but that, in the absence of policy action, it was still likely to exceed the top of the target by mid 2010. In addition, indicators of demand had remained strong through the second half of 2007, capacity utilisation remained high and shortages of suitable labour persisted. Recent trends in world commodity markets suggested that Australia's terms of trade were likely to rise further, providing an additional boost to incomes in Australia. ", " Members were strongly of the view that a significant slowing in demand from the pace observed through 2007 would be required for inflation to return to the target. Two important factors would work in that direction: significantly weaker global growth and the effect of rises in borrowing costs that had already occurred. The global situation was still evolving, and it was too soon to see the full effects of previous increases in interest rates, though household borrowing had slowed to some extent. ", " While noting the uncertainties surrounding forecasts, members judged that, on the basis of currently available information, the main risk was that demand would still prove to be too strong to allow a decline in inflation over a reasonable time period. Indicators of inflation expectations were also tending to rise, which could increase the cost of reducing inflation over time. They therefore concluded that the outlook for inflation required an immediate response from monetary policy. The debate focused on whether the change in the cash rate should be 25 or 50 basis points. ", " The discussion noted that a good case could be made for the larger move, on the grounds that the inflation outlook had deteriorated and the risk of inflation expectations becoming dislodged had increased. Thus there was a case for the Board to send a stronger signal of its intention to act as necessary to reduce inflation. Further, on some measures, the level of the cash rate in real terms arguably was noticeably below what might be expected given the economy's circumstances. On this basis, a significant further rise in the cash rate could be necessary. ", " Members noted that an argument in favour of a rise of only 25 basis points was that the level of rates faced by borrowers had already risen somewhat over the summer, independently of policy action. A rise of 25 basis points now would produce a total rise over nine months of about 100 basis points for business borrowers and around 90 basis points for housing borrowers. This was a significant increase over such a period and much of the effect of it was still to be seen. Additional tightening could be implemented at the March and/or subsequent meetings as judged necessary. Reinforcing this, global credit and equity markets, which the Board considered carefully, had also been unsettled over recent weeks, and the working out of the financial difficulties of the major international financial institutions had some way to run. To date, the effects of this on Australia had been confined to a significant slowing in the pace at which non-bank corporates and intermediaries could raise funds directly, with the major banks largely making up the difference. But some wider dampening effects could occur over the period ahead, which were difficult to factor into economic forecasts. ", " The Board judged that the case for the 25 basis point rise was, at this time, the more persuasive. However, the judgement was finely balanced and the Board would continue to review whether policy was sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the 2–3 per cent target within a reasonable period. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to raise the cash rate by 25 basis points to 7.0 per cent, effective 6 February. "]}},

The staff forecasts, which had been published in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, were for a noticeable slowing in trading partner growth in 2008, reflecting a sharp fall in growth among the G7 economies and ongoing strength in the Asian economies. Trading partner growth was then forecast to rise slightly in 2009. ", " Turning to the United States, where there had been little new information on the real economy in the past few weeks, members noted that indicators of housing construction continued to fall sharply in January. The low level of activity had led to a fall in the stock of unsold new houses, despite the low level of current sales. In an indication of the likely feedback effects on incomes and spending from the weak housing market, year-ended growth in retail sales fell below 3 per cent in January and there were signs that business investment had also slowed. However, growth in the US economy was benefiting from higher exports, which were being stimulated by the low exchange rate. ", " Japan had recorded strong growth in the December quarter 2007, but this was likely to reflect data volatility, as business and consumer sentiment had fallen in recent months and retail spending had softened. Housing construction activity had experienced a significant downturn since mid 2007, triggered by the introduction of tighter safety requirements for buildings. ", " Growth in the euro area had slowed over the course of 2007, to a rate just over 2 per cent, which was around trend. ", " Members observed that, in contrast, recent GDP data for the smaller east Asian economies had been strong, with the year-ended pace of growth of 6 per cent at the upper end of the range of recent years. ", " Turning to an assessment of inflation in the Asian region as a whole, the latest data showed inflation in China of over 7 per cent, mostly because of rising food prices. Members noted that the recent pick-up in consumer price inflation had not been confined to China; inflation in other east Asian economies was now around 4 per cent. Monetary policy settings throughout the region remained expansionary, with interest rates becoming negative in real terms as inflation had drifted higher. ", " Commodity prices had risen strongly in the past few months. The Tapis crude oil price, which was the most relevant benchmark for Australia, had eased around the end of 2007 but since then had increased to over US$100 per barrel. Members felt that while various supply-side explanations had contributed to the short-term movements, the main underlying factor was a continuation of strong demand, as a result of the high rates of growth in particular parts of the world economy. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Before reviewing developments in the domestic economy, members noted that the national accounts for the December quarter were to be released the next day. They were briefed on the Bank's assessment that the data published so far on the main expenditure and income components suggested growth in GDP could be around ½ per cent in the quarter and around 3½ per cent over the year, assuming no revisions. Domestic demand was expected to have increased by over 5 per cent through the year. Data released during the meeting, showing that net external trade had subtracted significantly from growth in the December quarter, along with strong growth in public demand, were not regarded as having a material net effect on the forecast for output growth in the quarter. ", " Members then turned to their review of recent developments in the domestic economy and considered the information provided by the run of regular data releases, covering household consumption, the housing, business and external sectors, and the labour market and wages. ", " Retail sales had increased rapidly over the course of 2007. The data for January, which were released during the meeting, indicated that sales were flat in the month, though they had grown strongly over the past year. Strong growth in household disposable income, which was around 8 per cent in real terms over the year to the September quarter, had underpinned growth in consumption. Industry sources suggested that conditions in the retail sector had been mixed during February. Members noted that consumer sentiment had fallen in recent months and was now below average, though sentiment had not always been a reliable indicator of short-term movements in consumption. ", " Discussion then turned to developments in the housing sector. Housing construction was seen as providing a source of future growth in activity, as the current level of commencements was running well below estimates of underlying requirements, based on population growth and household formation, and vacancy rates were at record lows. Although the sharp fall in building approvals in December had unwound the previously apparent growth in approvals, members recognised that this might have reflected data volatility. They were informed that the Bank's liaison with builders indicated that conditions were not as weak as suggested by the December building approvals figures. ", " In the secondary housing market, house prices had increased relatively strongly on a nationwide basis over the course of 2007. However, growth in house prices in Perth had ceased, after prices had reached a high level, and house prices in some outer suburbs of Sydney continued to be weak. In the main auction markets of Sydney and Melbourne, which reflect sales activity at the upper end of the market, conditions had softened in February. Auction clearance rates had fallen noticeably in both cities, and were now a little below average in Sydney and about average in Melbourne, having been close to peak levels in that city in mid 2007. ", " Demand for housing finance was now easing somewhat, with the monthly rate of growth of housing credit having fallen from around 1 per cent in mid 2007 to around 0.8 per cent, on average, in the past several months. This was at the lower end of the range over the past decade. Loan approvals as a share of credit outstanding had also fallen since mid 2007. ", " In the business sector, members observed that the NAB survey for the month of January showed a divergence between business conditions and business confidence. The business conditions index, which reflected activity and sales, had remained well above average levels, though it had flattened out, while business confidence fell sharply and was now below average. The latter was a more subjective indicator, and the latest movement most likely reflected global financial problems and tighter financial conditions domestically. The Sensis survey of small and medium businesses continued to show that these businesses were more concerned about finding quality staff than a lack of work or sales. ", " Businesses planned to increase investment in the year ahead, according to the latest capital expenditure survey, and business credit growth had risen steadily over the past 12 months, to about 24 per cent per annum. Part of this increase reflected the process of reintermediation as capital market funding for businesses had dried up for all but the largest companies. But total provision of credit to the business sector had nevertheless accelerated. ", " Turning to the external sector, members were informed that import volumes were estimated to have increased strongly in the December quarter and over the course of 2007. The increases were associated with the rapid growth in domestic demand, as well as owing something to the higher exchange rate. ", " The Board examined trends in commodity prices, which were picking up again after a flat period in the middle of last year, and would again contribute significantly to growth in domestic incomes. They would also be a source of cost pressure for some businesses in Australia. ", " New contract iron ore prices for 2008, which in January had been expected to rise by around 40 per cent, were now likely to rise by at least 65 per cent, based on a recent Japanese settlement with a Brazilian producer. A similar pattern was emerging in the market for coal, where the current spot price was more than double the 2007 contract price. Part of the pressure on coal prices had come from Chinese demand, as China had recently switched to being a net importer of coal. Negotiations over the 2008 coal contract prices were yet to be completed. Base metals prices had also strengthened in the past few months, though they were some way below the peak reached in the first half of 2007. Prices of rural commodities had risen very rapidly recently; wheat prices had doubled over the past year. ", " Overall, sharply higher prices for the key exports of iron ore and coal would underpin the terms of trade, which were now expected to increase by 10–15 per cent around mid year, noticeably higher than the forecast presented in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. Thereafter they were expected to fall somewhat as global demand eased and the supply of a range of commodities picked up. ", " In their discussion of the labour market and wages, members observed that the tightness of the labour market was consistent with the strength of the economy. Employment had increased again, and the unemployment rate had fallen, in January. ", " After adjusting the wage price index for the timing of the 2006 minimum wage decision, wages growth on this measure had been steady at just over 4 per cent for the past three years. Other wage measures, including ordinary-time earnings and the national accounts measure of average earnings, were showing higher rates of increase, though preliminary indications were that the national accounts measure would moderate in the December quarter. Members considered it possible that there had been some upward drift in wages that had not been captured in the wage price index, though the variation in other wage measures did not allow a definitive conclusion. A concern was that higher inflationary expectations might influence future wage outcomes. ", " The revised inflation forecast prepared for the meeting was lower than that presented at the previous meeting, as it incorporated the effect of the cash rate increase in February and the higher exchange rate since then. CPI inflation was expected to be a little above 4 per cent in the short term. In the central forecast, both underlying and headline inflation were expected to be slightly below 3 per cent by mid 2010. The inflation forecast was premised on demand growth slowing sufficiently to reduce capacity pressures in the economy. Members recognised that these forecasts were subject to a high degree of uncertainty and that there were significant risks on both the upside and downside. "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board's discussion of developments in financial markets commenced with share markets. Members noted that while global share markets had been more settled for most of the past month, following the sharp falls in January, a degree of weakness and volatility had re-emerged in the past few days and sentiment remained fragile. Prices of financial stocks had continued to fall in all share markets and there had been further announcements of write-downs, which appeared to have spread beyond exposure to the sub-prime sector. There were also ongoing concerns about the financial condition of the specialist bond insurers. ", " Turning to money markets, members noted that tensions in the US and European markets had recently re-emerged after a few months of relative calm. In the United States, market pricing anticipated a reduction in policy rates at the Federal Reserve's March meeting, and further reductions beyond that. ", " The European Central Bank had maintained its current policy setting at its recent meeting. Despite officials emphasising their concerns about inflation, the market expected a cut in the policy rate in the euro area in the coming month. Interest rates in Japan were unchanged. Elsewhere, further rate cuts were expected in the UK, and also in Canada, where a significant easing had been priced in by the market, given the linkages between the Canadian and US economies. The policy rate had been lifted in Sweden, though further increases were not expected. ", " In their discussion on exchange rates, members noted that the US dollar had fallen sharply against the yen and the euro, after a period of a few months in which the dollar appeared to have stabilised. The dollar had reached a new low against the euro and on a trade-weighted basis. The euro had continued to rise in foreign exchange markets and was now at a record high in real effective terms. The falls in the US dollar had been accompanied by increases in the renminbi exchange rate, though these had not been large enough to forestall a fall in the Chinese effective exchange rate. Members observed that the recently higher inflation rate in China implied there had been some appreciation of China's real exchange rate. ", " The Australian dollar had moved higher over the past month, supported by high interest differentials, strong economic data and increases in commodity prices. In trade-weighted terms, the exchange rate had increased by 4 per cent over the month and by 10 per cent over the past year. The increase against the US dollar over the year had been close to 20 per cent. ", " Spreads in the Australian money market had widened significantly over the past month. The spread between three-month bank paper and the expected policy rate was now above the peaks since last August. The Bank had increased exchange settlement balances in the past few weeks, but by a smaller amount than at the time of the rises in spreads in September and December, as the stresses in the overnight market had not been as evident as in the earlier episodes. Current market pricing indicated that a rise in the cash rate at this meeting, and a further tightening by mid year, was expected. ", " Members then discussed recent trends in bank funding. Access to funding had been readily available, and banks’ offshore issuance in the first two months of the year had been very large. Issuance had been in several major markets, particularly the US private placement market. There had been a large amount of domestic issuance as well. Spreads had widened further relative to swap rates, which had themselves risen. ", " As a result of the substantial increases in banks’ funding costs, members observed that lending rates across the spectrum of loan products had risen by more than the increases in the cash rate since mid 2007. The funding pressures had already been passed on to business lending rates, which were mostly linked to bank bill rates. It was likely that banks would pass on recent increases in funding costs to prime housing loan rates in the period ahead. ", " The latest available data showed that margin calls had picked up sharply in January, which had led to a large fall in margin debt outstanding. This had contributed to a fall in personal lending in January. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points to 7.25 per cent. ", " Members viewed the standard macroeconomic considerations as continuing to suggest the need for further tightening. Growth in the world economy was likely to be below trend this year and next, but at the same time very strong rises in key commodity prices would lift the terms of trade noticeably, thereby providing an additional boost to domestic incomes. If anything, commodity prices looked stronger than previously. Labour market conditions had remained strong early in 2008 and reports of high capacity usage and shortages of suitable labour persisted. In the near term, inflation was likely to rise further in year‑ended terms from its already-high level. It would then probably moderate during 2009, in response to the forecast slowing in demand. There was some evidence, albeit tentative, that a slowing in private demand was starting to emerge, but its extent remained uncertain. Overall, the economy still faced a period in which inflation could be uncomfortably high. Members were mindful as well of the risk that further increases in inflationary expectations could influence future wage and price outcomes, which could complicate the task of reducing inflation. Hence, the question remained whether the current stance of monetary policy was sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back towards <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span>  over a reasonable period. ", " In judging the appropriate extent of further tightening, members also recognised that developments in financial markets in recent months, both overseas and in Australia, had increased funding costs for intermediaries by more than the effects of past and expected future policy changes. Prior to the meeting, 90-day market yields on private paper had reached around 8 per cent, up by about 150 basis points since the middle of 2007. Rates for borrowers from intermediaries were likely to rise by more than any increase in the cash rate, reflecting these higher funding costs. Members also noted the possibility of non-price tightening of credit terms, which, if it occurred, would add to the restraint imposed by higher interest rates. ", " On balance, members concluded that a further 25 basis point rise in the cash rate was necessary to restrain demand, in order to reduce inflation over time. As a result of this decision and earlier policy adjustments, and rises in borrowing costs that were occurring independently of changes in monetary policy, members saw the overall tightening in financial conditions since the middle of 2007 as substantial. They judged that the higher setting of the cash rate would leave adequate flexibility to respond as necessary over the months ahead to new information about prospects for economic activity and inflation.

"], "International Economic Conditions": [" The Board's discussion of the world economy commenced with a briefing on the outlook for Australia's trading partners. Estimated GDP growth for trading partners in the March quarter had been strong, at 1¼ per cent. Staff forecasts continued to be for some slowing over the course of the year, leading to annual growth of around 4 per cent in both 2008 and 2009. This was expected to result from weakness in the industrial economies and a moderation to a still firm pace of growth in the emerging economies. ", " In the United States, members noted that GDP growth had been very weak in the past two quarters and forecasts were for year-ended growth in 2008 to be less than 1 per cent. Conditions in the labour market continued to weaken. After strong growth in employment over several years, employment had fallen in the past four months and unemployment had risen from 4½ per cent to 5 per cent over the past year. ", " The main source of uncertainty about prospects for the US economy was the housing sector. Residential investment had fallen sharply and, based on the leading indicators of building activity, further falls were expected; its current share of GDP was approaching the lowest levels reached over the past 50 years. The stock of unsold new houses was now falling, but the process of adjustment was slow given the low level of current sales. Nationwide house prices had again fallen over the past month, and the rate of decline appeared to be picking up. The adverse effect on consumer confidence and ensuing reluctance to spend on housing were dampening economic activity. ", " In Japan, growth in the March quarter had been solid but a slowing was expected over the course of 2008, given the decline in growth of industrial production and deterioration in measures of sentiment. Members noted that export growth was likely to slow as a result of the weakness in some of Japan's key trading partners. ", " Growth in other east Asian economies had been resilient in the early months of 2008, both in terms of domestic demand and exports. Nonetheless, GDP growth was expected to moderate to about 4 per cent over the course of 2008. ", " Members spent some time discussing inflation in east Asia. CPI inflation was over 8 per cent in China at present and was averaging close to 6 per cent for the other economies in the region. Core inflation had also risen noticeably in these economies over the past year. Nevertheless, there was no clear evidence of rising cost pressures affecting export prices from China; while a measure of the price of imports to the United States from China was rising, this was entirely attributable to the depreciation of the US dollar. ", " The Indian economy was also growing strongly, maintaining the step-up in the growth rate that began about a decade ago, following a series of structural reforms in the 1990s. In the latest year, growth was running at almost 9 per cent per annum. ", " In the euro area, GDP growth had been quite strong on average in the March quarter, driven by a robust result for Germany, although recent data on industrial production and measures of consumer and business confidence suggested weaker results ahead. ", " Growth in the United Kingdom had eased a little, to about 2½ per cent. The UK economy was undergoing a severe housing adjustment. Loan approvals and house prices were falling sharply as a result of the tightening in credit conditions since August 2007, which could contribute to further slowing in the economy in the period ahead. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Board members' review of current conditions in the Australian economy commenced with a discussion of the fiscal position, following the announcement of the budget in mid May. Members observed that the budget surplus as a ratio to GDP was noticeably higher for 2007/08 and 2008/09 than had been expected in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook last October; at that time, a surplus of a bit over 1 per cent of GDP had been projected for both years. Measured in terms of the change in the surplus, fiscal policy was expected to impart a mildly contractionary effect on the economy in 2008/09. ", " With the national accounts for the March quarter to be released the next day, members were briefed about the partial data released in the few days prior to the meeting, which pointed to modest growth in the quarter. Data released during the meeting, showing that net external trade had subtracted significantly from growth in the March quarter, along with strong growth in public demand, were not regarded as having a material net effect on this assessment. ", " Members then considered the information provided by the run of regular monthly data releases, covering household consumption, the housing and business sectors, commodity prices and the labour market and wages. ", " Retail sales had been flat over the first four months of the year, leading to a decline in year-ended growth from about 8 per cent in December 2007 to 4¾ per cent in April. Liaison with retailers conducted by the staff suggested no significant change in conditions in May. Growth in sales by small retailers surveyed by the ABS had fallen sharply since the end of 2007. The cycle in sales by small retailers tended to be more pronounced than that of large retailers, but growth in sales of large retailers was also slowing. Members noted that consumer sentiment had remained well below average in the past few months, with this being particularly evident in consumers' views on buying conditions. ", " Turning to the housing sector, members observed that data on building approvals released during the meeting did not change the assessment that the near-term outlook for housing activity remained relatively weak. Housing finance had continued to soften, with housing loan approvals falling in March and, on preliminary estimates, in April. This suggested slower growth in housing credit in the next few months. ", " There were no new data on house prices available. However, falls in auction clearance rates in both Sydney and Melbourne from the highs reached late in 2007 to below-average levels in the past few months were consistent with a continuation of flat house prices. ", " In the business sector, data on business finance suggested that borrowing had slowed sharply. Although the series was highly volatile, on a three-month-ended annualised basis, growth in business credit had fallen from over 25 per cent at the end of 2007 to 5 per cent in April. While part of this pattern had reflected the process of reintermediation during the early phase of the credit crisis, the growth of total business debt including raisings from financial markets had also slowed markedly. Falls in commercial loan approvals suggested continued weakness in business borrowing from intermediaries in the months ahead. ", " Members noted that business conditions, reflecting activity and sales, had declined in the past few months though they remained above average, according to the NAB survey. Confidence about the business outlook, which was a more subjective measure, had fallen more significantly. The Sensis survey of small and medium businesses showed that business conditions in that sector fell well below average in the March quarter. ", " Members were advised that, based on the capital expenditure and business activity surveys, business investment was now growing at a more moderate pace than had been typical over the past few years. Nonetheless, business investment remained at a high level as a share of GDP. The March quarter capital expenditure survey indicated that investment intentions among businesses were still very strong, being well ahead of similar estimates made a year earlier. However, the staff forecasts anticipated some scaling back of these investment intentions over the course of the year. ", " Discussion of commodity prices began with oil. The Tapis crude oil price had increased from about US$120 per barrel to over US$130 per barrel over the past month. In Australian dollar terms, the rise in the oil price over the past year or so had been dampened noticeably by the appreciation of the exchange rate. Prices of some other commodities, including wheat and base metals, had fallen significantly over the past couple of months, though they were still at high levels. ", " The currently observed level of petrol prices implied a rise in the automotive fuel component of the CPI of around 6 per cent in each of the June and September quarters. These increases would add about ¼ percentage point to the change in the CPI in each period. ", " Turning to the labour market, members noted that employment growth had continued to be strong in April. Forward indicators of job vacancies and employment intentions, as indicated in business surveys, suggested some moderation was likely in the months ahead, though employment intentions were still above average. ", " Members took careful note that, despite the sustained strength of the labour market, aggregate wages growth had remained contained, according to the latest data. The wage price index increased by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter, keeping year-ended growth steady at just over 4 per cent. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members observed that sentiment in international financial markets had continued to improve over the past month, though there had been some signs of nervousness in overseas markets in the days leading up to the meeting. Credit default swap spreads had fallen through May to the levels seen late in 2007, but then rose somewhat following rating downgrades for several major US investment banks. ", " Conditions in most developed economy money markets had also been improving, though there had been some signs of tension around the end of May. This pattern had also been apparent in Australia. The Bank had lowered exchange settlement balances to around $1¾ billion and the interest rates that the Bank's counterparties were bidding had returned to pre-crisis levels. ", " The major development in global financial markets in the month was a rise in government bond yields in the major markets, reflecting an increased focus on inflation risks among market participants. ", " Bond yields had also risen in Australia. The Government had announced an increase in the supply of bonds over the next several years to enhance liquidity in the market, together with changes to withholding tax arrangements relating to State government paper (semis). The latter announcement resulted in a noticeable narrowing of the spread between semis and 10‑year Commonwealth Government securities. ", " Discussion then turned to an examination of monetary policy settings in the major economies. Members noted there had not been any significant changes in monetary policy abroad over the past month, and concerns about rising inflation had eliminated expectations of further easing in most countries. In fact, the market saw a greater likelihood of rate rises than falls in each of the three major economies. The exception to this was Canada, where the central bank was still expected to reduce its policy rate. ", " Members noted that, despite the monetary policy easing by the Fed over the past year or so, US mortgage rates had not fallen. ", " The performance of most share markets had been mixed over the past month. The general trends were that resources stocks had risen and financials had moved lower, as had consumer stocks. These trends were also evident in the Australian market, which had seen little change overall. ", " On foreign exchange markets, members observed that the US dollar remained near its lows in both nominal and real effective terms. Following a period of steadiness, the Chinese renminbi had appreciated a little further against the US dollar recently. While the appreciation of 10 per cent of the renminbi against the US dollar over the past year had been substantial, this was largely a reflection of US dollar weakness. The renminbi had depreciated by 5 per cent against the euro, which had dampened the increase in the effective exchange rate of the renminbi over the past year. ", " The Australian dollar appreciated further against all the currencies in the trade-weighted basket over the past month, and had almost reached post-float highs against the US dollar. Higher bulk commodity prices had been an important spur to the rise in the exchange rate. The Australian dollar was 7–8 per cent higher over the past year, having risen against most currencies. ", " Reviewing developments in capital markets, members noted that bond issuance by Australian banks had continued at a strong pace in May, with a greater proportion denominated in euro and Australian dollars. In line with the improvement in financial market sentiment, recent issues had been at lower spreads than previous issues and maturities had lengthened. Conditions in the domestic residential mortgage-backed securities market had also improved, but the high cost of most recent issues suggested they had not been a very profitable source of funding for issuers. However, demand appeared to be quite healthy, which pointed to improving prospects for this part of the market. ", " Expectations for monetary policy in Australia, as reflected in pricing in the money market, had fluctuated over the past month. Current pricing indicated that no change in the cash rate was expected at this meeting, though the pricing suggested that markets saw a reasonable chance of a tightening towards the end of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was to leave the cash rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent. ", " As in previous meetings, the central issue was that, over the past year, inflation had picked up to an uncomfortably high rate, against a background of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand. In this environment, it was necessary for demand to slow in order to reduce inflation over time. ", " The question facing the Board remained whether, as a result of the earlier tightening of monetary policy, market rises in borrowing rates and tighter credit standards, financial conditions were exerting an appropriate degree of restraint on demand. ", " In reaching their decision, Board members noted that the bulk of indicators becoming available over the past month continued to suggest moderation in the growth of domestic demand. These included flat retail sales, declining household and commercial loan approvals, lower growth in housing and business credit, and subdued business and consumer confidence. Asset markets were also less buoyant than previously. Labour market conditions, on the other hand, had remained strong to date. This could be explained by lags, in which case a moderation in employment growth could be expected soon. ", " Members agreed that it was important for the slowing trend to continue. In discussing the outlook, they noted that there remained considerable uncertainty in the forecasts for demand and inflation, as there were strongly opposing forces operating on the economy. While financial conditions were working to moderate demand, the rise in Australia's terms of trade that was currently occurring would work in the opposite direction, and would add substantially to national income and ability to spend. There was also a high degree of uncertainty about the international economic outlook, in particular the extent of the slowdown that was occurring in the developed economies. Conditions in international financial markets, though gradually improving, also remained difficult. ", " On balance, the Board's assessment continued to be that, on current policy settings, the necessary moderation in demand growth was likely to occur. They concluded that it was therefore appropriate to maintain the current setting of monetary policy for the time being. However, should demand not slow as expected or should expectations of high ongoing inflation begin to affect wage- and price-setting behaviour, the outlook, and the stance of policy, would need to be reviewed. The Board would continue to evaluate prospects for economic activity and inflation in the light of new information.

These had not changed in recent months, and continued to show that GDP of Australia's trading partners (export-weighted) would grow by around 4 per cent in both 2008 and 2009. While this was down from an average of 5 per cent in the past few years, it was in line with longer-run averages. These staff forecasts were similar to the most recent IMF forecasts, though Consensus private-sector forecasts were slightly higher. The slowing was mainly expected to result from further weakness in the industrial economies. ", " In the United States, conditions in the labour market had deteriorated further, with employment falling again in May and the unemployment rate rising to 5½ per cent. Members noted that other signs of weakness in the US economy included the continued decline in housing activity and house prices, and a moderation in consumer spending. Consumption was likely to be supported in the coming months by a sharp boost to disposable incomes following the receipt of tax rebates as part of the US Government's stimulus package, but the outlook beyond that period remained quite uncertain. ", " In Japan, growth in GDP in the March quarter had been stronger than expected, but there had been a general softening in a range of other economic indicators, including the Tankan survey of business conditions. ", " In the euro area, GDP growth had also been stronger than expected in the March quarter, and was running at over 2 per cent on a year-ended basis. However, other indicators, including those measuring consumer and business sentiment, pointed to below-average growth. ", " Growth in east Asia had been strong thus far in 2008. Growth in industrial production had remained very rapid in China and had firmed over the past year in most other east Asian economies. Members noted that rising inflation in east Asia was beginning to pose an important challenge for those economies. The authorities in some economies had moved to tighten policy somewhat recently, but monetary policies were still expansionary in the region. ", " GDP in New Zealand had fallen in the March quarter. The outlook there was for further weakness, and markets were expecting monetary policy to be eased later in the year. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Before turning to the most recent data on the domestic economy, members reviewed the national accounts for the March quarter, which were released the day after the previous meeting. The accounts indicated that growth was slowing, with GDP rising by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter and year-ended growth of 3.6 per cent. These figures included unusually strong measured contributions from growth of finance and insurance sector output, which seemed out of line with other indicators of finance sector activity. Excluding this sector, GDP growth was estimated to have been 3.2 per cent over the year to the March quarter. ", " Growth in productivity, measured in terms of non-farm output per head, had slowed noticeably over the past year as output growth had slowed but employment had continued to rise strongly. While short-term trends were difficult to interpret, average productivity growth had apparently slowed noticeably over the past few years, compared with the late 1990s. ", " Members then considered the information provided by the run of regular monthly data releases, covering household consumption, the housing, business and rural sectors, commodity prices, and the labour market and wages. ", " Members agreed that consumption spending was slowing. Retail sales had been flat over the first four months of the year, and year-ended growth had fallen from about 8 per cent at the end of 2007 to 4¾ per cent in April. Sales by small retailers had slowed sharply. This series is less reliably measured than sales by large retailers and it is more cyclically sensitive, but growth in sales of large retailers was also slowing. Liaison with retailers conducted by the staff was consistent with the weaker trend in retail sales figures in recent months. Signs of weakness in consumption were also evident in consumer sentiment, which fell a bit further in June. ", " Members noted that real household disposable income had been flat in the six months to March after taking account of interest payments. Rising fuel costs were contributing to the slowing in real disposable income growth. Lower returns from superannuation investments arising from falling equity prices, at the margin, could also reduce households' willingness to spend. Working in the other direction in the near term were the income tax cuts scheduled to commence on 1 July, which would add about 1 per cent to household income over the course of the new financial year. ", " Turning to the housing sector, members observed that the near-term outlook for housing activity remained soft, with dwelling approvals and commencements declining in the early months of 2008. These indicators of housing activity were running well below estimates of underlying demand. ", " Preliminary data on house prices in the June quarter, based on sales in April and May, suggested that prices nationwide had fallen after recording modest growth in the March quarter. This was a significant change from the strong rate of increase over 2007. The estimates suggested that house prices were flat or down in most capital cities in the June quarter. ", " Housing finance had weakened further, with sharp falls in April and May, based on preliminary estimates, and monthly housing credit growth had slowed to around 0.6 per cent. The cumulative fall in loan approvals since the peak in the middle of 2007 was similar to that seen in previous slowdowns. ", " Auction clearance rates in both Sydney and Melbourne had remained low in the past month and sales volumes had declined somewhat. ", " Turning to the business sector, members initially discussed the effect of the Apache gas plant disruption on economic activity in Western Australia. They noted that gas production in Western Australia had fallen by one-third, with gas accounting for about 60 per cent of the energy supply in that state. While the position was still highly uncertain, initial staff estimates were that the disruption would have the effect of reducing economic output in the state by around 3 per cent for the duration of the disruption. The estimated effect on the Australian economy as a whole would be to subtract about ¼ percentage point from GDP growth. ", " Looking at business conditions more broadly, members noted that commercial loan approvals, though typically volatile, had fallen sharply from the high levels recorded in 2007. Growth in loans outstanding had also slowed sharply, with business credit growing at an annual rate of 6 per cent over the three months to May. Business credit growth had been around 25 per cent at the end of 2007, though part of this rapid growth had reflected the process of reintermediation during the early phase of the credit crisis. Members judged that the slowing was most likely due both to a decline in credit demand by businesses and also tighter credit standards being imposed by banks. ", " The NAB survey showed that business conditions had declined in the past few months but remained above average. The survey measure of business confidence, which was more subjective, had fallen more significantly and was below average. The fall in business conditions in the small and medium business sector in the June quarter, according to the Sensis survey, was more pronounced, suggesting this sector was more sensitive to the current slowing in demand. ", " Turning to the labour market, members noted that the fall in employment in May – the first fall in more than 18 months – had reduced year-ended employment growth from almost 3 per cent to a little over 2 per cent. While the series could be volatile, softer figures in the months ahead would be consistent with other indicators that were showing moderation in demand. Job advertisements, for example, were not as strong in the first half of this year as they had been in 2007. ", " Members observed that the latest forecast by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics for wheat production in 2008/09, at around 24 million tonnes, could be optimistic given the most recent weather patterns across the country. Were a third consecutive year of poor agricultural output to occur, it would be unprecedented in the past 100 years. Inflows into the Murray-Darling river system thus far in 2008 were lower than last year and also lower than the long-term average of drought years. ", " Discussion of commodity prices began by focusing on bulk commodities, contract prices for which had risen very substantially in 2008. Members commented that an increasing proportion of output of these commodities was being sold at prices linked to the spot market, where prices currently were even higher. ", " The Tapis crude oil price had increased to over US$140 per barrel during the past month. The rise in the oil price over the past year and a half in Australian dollar terms had been dampened by the appreciation of the exchange rate, and this had helped to contain the increase in the retail price of petrol. Nonetheless, the increase in the retail petrol price in the past few months had been significant and, if it remained at current levels, was expected to make a contribution to CPI inflation of at least ¼ percentage point in each of the June and September quarters. ", " On wages, the latest data on average earnings from the national accounts indicated growth of 4 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Although the series was volatile, and had been as high as 6 per cent during 2007, the latest reading was broadly in line with other wage indicators. ", " Members were informed that, apart from the near-term effect on the headline CPI of higher petrol prices, there had been no material change in the inflation outlook. The June quarter CPI, which would be released before the next meeting, was expected to show inflation of over 1 per cent in the quarter. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that there had been more focus on inflation in global financial markets over the past month. A marked shift in monetary policy expectations in several countries had been prompted by data showing higher inflation and comments from central bank officials indicating concern about rising inflationary expectations. ", " In the United States, the focus of markets on inflation was reflected in a change in expectations for the federal funds rate, from further cuts to a rise by the end of the year. At one point in the month, markets had priced in three rises by the end of the year. However, by the end of June renewed credit concerns had seen these expectations pared back. ", " Growing concerns about inflation had seen a shift to expectations of tighter monetary policy in the euro area. There were strong indications that official interest rates would be increased at the July meeting of the European Central Bank. Rate rises had been priced in for the United Kingdom and several other European countries. New Zealand was an exception to the change in market expectations, with a rate cut in the next few months seen as likely. Policy settings in Japan were not expected to change. ", " Concerns about rising inflation led to rises in yields on government bonds in the major markets over the month, particularly at the two-year horizon, but they fell towards the end of June as credit concerns resurfaced. Yields on Australian government bonds had generally moved in line with those overseas. ", " In most east Asian economies, real interest rates were negative as inflation had risen rapidly but monetary policy had been tightened only gradually. ", " Renewed credit concerns had emerged in global markets over the past month. There were further downgrades of several major international investment banks and also of monoline insurers. Credit default swap spreads had risen in the major markets in June. Bank credit default swap spreads in several countries had also widened, and some banks were raising more capital. ", " In money markets, however, conditions had not changed much overall over the past month; there had been some improvement in euro area markets. Money market conditions in Australia were little changed. ", " Share markets had recorded large falls over the past month. Financial stocks had been worst affected, but non-financial stocks had also fallen. ", " In Australia, the falls in share prices had been of similar magnitude to those in the major markets. The ASX 200 index fell by 17 per cent over the 2007/08 financial year. While resources stocks rose by more than 20 per cent, financial and other stocks fell by over 30 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. ", " Members observed that major foreign exchange markets had been relatively calm over the past month. ", " In Asia, concerns about the Vietnamese economy, which had high inflation and a large current account deficit, had put downward pressure on the dong, though policy actions by the authorities saw this wound back somewhat. There had also been declines in a number of other Asian currencies, prompted by concerns relating to the global economic slowdown and the effects of high oil prices. ", " The Australian dollar reached a new multi-year high over the past month both against the US dollar and measured on a trade-weighted basis. This seemed to be mostly due to higher commodity prices. The Australian dollar was about 6 per cent higher over the past year. ", " Turning to developments in capital markets, members noted that the continued strong pace of bond issuance by Australian banks meant that they were funding beyond current needs and for next year. The maturities of new bond issuance had lengthened, and there were indications that spreads at issuance were now starting to narrow. ", " Over the past month, there had been signs that conditions in the domestic residential mortgage-backed securities market had improved further, with new issues at lower cost than those earlier in the year. Mortgage-backed securities markets in other economies had remained very subdued so far this year. ", " Expectations for monetary policy in Australia, as reflected in pricing in the money market, had fluctuated a little but were for no change at this meeting. Beyond that, movements had been broadly in line with global trends, with markets pricing in a 50 per cent chance of a tightening by the end of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In recent months, the Board had held the cash rate steady at 7.25 per cent, reflecting the assessment that there had been a significant tightening in financial conditions, which would work to slow demand and reduce inflation over time. The recommendation put to the Board at this meeting was that the cash rate continue to be held steady. ", " In assessing this recommendation, members concurred that the evidence becoming available in the latest month had added weight to the view that the current stance of policy, in conjunction with the more general tightening in financial conditions that had occurred since the middle of last year and most recently the additional rise in fuel costs, were working to restrain demand. Consumer spending had slowed significantly and there had been a marked decline in the growth of credit to both households and businesses. Surveys indicated that confidence had fallen further over the past month and asset prices were weakening. In addition, there were some early signs of softening in labour market conditions. The deterioration in conditions in financial markets over the past month had probably tightened financial conditions a little further. ", " On the other hand, members expected that the CPI for the June quarter, which would be released before the next Board meeting, would show another high reading. These high outcomes risked lifting inflationary expectations and/or wage demands. If that occurred, it would make inflation more difficult to reduce over time. ", " Members were also conscious that the rise in the terms of trade that was taking place would add substantially to national income and that this could translate into renewed growth in spending. This meant that there remained considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation. ", " On balance, while members remained concerned about the current rate of inflation and the uncertainties about the outlook, the increasing signs that demand was slowing suggested that the existing policy setting was exerting the appropriate degree of restraint. Provided demand continued to evolve as expected, inflation was likely to decline over time. ", " Weighing up the various factors, the Board judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate and would continue to evaluate prospects for economic activity and inflation in the light of new information.

{"Date": ["Sydney – 5 August 2008"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Ric Battellino (Deputy Governor), Ken Henry AC (Secretary to the Treasury), John Akehurst, Jillian Broadbent AO, Roger Corbett AO, Graham Kraehe AO, Donald McGauchie AO, Warwick McKibbin "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Malcolm Edey (Assistant Governor, Economic), Tony Richards (Head of Economic Analysis Department) ", " David Emanuel (Secretary), Anthony Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Inflation": [" Board members were briefed on the CPI data for the June quarter 2008. The high quarterly outcome of 1.5 per cent had lifted the year-ended inflation rate to 4.5 per cent. A significant contribution to the CPI had come from the financial services component, which accounted for around 8 per cent of the CPI; this component had risen by more than 10 per cent over the year to the June quarter and had increased by 4 per cent in the quarter itself. The high quarterly increase incorporated a significant one-time correction for previous underestimates. Members noted that this component of the cost of living was very difficult to measure. But even abstracting from this, inflation had still been high over the past year, with a range of measures of underlying inflation currently around 4 per cent. ", " Members noted that prices of tradable items in the CPI, which had been held down by competition in world goods markets and a period of exchange rate appreciation earlier in the decade, had risen over the past year. Prices of non-tradable items, which were mainly services, had increased strongly over the past year; the largest contributions in the June quarter had come from increases in rents, house purchase and health-related costs. Using an internationally comparable definition of core inflation simply excluding food, energy and financial services, the pick-up in Australia's inflation rate was less pronounced than the CPI suggested, but still indicated stronger inflation pressure in Australia than in other developed countries. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The Board's discussion of the world economy examined conditions in the major economies, which were generally seen as weak. ", " In the United States, consumption and exports had underpinned growth in GDP in the June quarter, but a key question was the extent to which consumption spending would continue to increase once the effects of the recent fiscal stimulus faded. Employment had fallen for the seventh consecutive month in July and the unemployment rate had risen by a little over 1 percentage point from its trough, but the deterioration in labour market conditions thus far had not been as severe as in the 2001–2002 slowdown. However, housing activity, which had been a major source of weakness, had fallen by the same extent, and to about the same low point, as in past cyclical downturns, and house prices were still falling. Stocks of unsold new houses were now being run down, but there was still a large overhang, which suggested that building activity was likely to remain low for a while longer. ", " Growth had slowed a little in China, to about 10 per cent over the year to the June quarter. Domestic demand had remained strong, but growth of exports, particularly to the large developed economies, had slowed sharply over the past year. ", " Conditions in Japan were deteriorating. Measures of business sentiment among large firms, as measured by the Tankan survey, had declined from high levels to about average, while sentiment indices for small businesses and consumers were close to earlier cyclical lows. ", " In the euro area, the latest indicators of industrial production and consumer and business sentiment pointed to slowing growth. The UK economy had slowed significantly in the first half of 2008, with GDP growth declining to around 1½ per cent over the year to the June quarter. The housing sector was an area of particular weakness at present and business sentiment had also deteriorated. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members considered the information provided by the regular monthly data releases, covering household consumption, the housing and business sectors, the labour market, and trade and commodity prices. ", " They observed that consumption spending had weakened considerably in 2008, with retail sales being essentially flat in value terms over the first half of the year. In volume terms, retail spending had fallen in this period, with both large and small retailers exhibiting weaker trends in sales. Liaison with retailers conducted by the staff had confirmed that June had been a very weak month, but suggested that sales in July had not been as weak. Consumer sentiment had fallen further in July. ", " Turning to the housing sector, members noted that the fall in building approvals since late 2007 implied that the current rate at which the housing stock was being expanded was noticeably below the long-term growth in underlying demand. Conditions in the secondary housing market had nevertheless softened, with nationwide house prices flat in the first half of the year, following a strong rise over the course of 2007. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had remained well below last year's high rates over the past month, and the number of properties offered for sale had begun to fall. Current levels of these indicators were consistent with house prices showing little change at present. Earlier movements in equity markets and house prices suggested that household net worth had declined by almost 5 per cent over the first half of 2008. ", " Growth in household credit continued to slow in June. The fall in monthly growth of household credit from about 1 per cent late in 2007 to 0.6 per cent now implied annual growth of around 7 per cent, which was similar to the growth of household income. ", " In the business sector, surveys suggested that overall business conditions had eased from peak levels to about average over the past year, but the more subjective measure of business confidence had fallen well below average. Growth in total business borrowing had slowed sharply in the past few months. ", " Members noted that, despite a rise in employment in June, there were some early signs of easing in labour market conditions. Although year-ended employment growth was steady at a bit above 2 per cent and the unemployment rate had been little changed in June, newspaper job advertisements measured by the ANZ Bank had declined sharply in the past few months. Broader measures that included job advertisements on the internet were also softening, and employment intentions from a range of business surveys suggested employment growth would moderate in the period ahead. ", " Members noted that no data on aggregate wages developments had been released over the past month. ", " On international trade and commodity prices, members observed that high prices for key commodities had led to a sharp turnaround in the trade balance from a large deficit to a small surplus in recent months. The increase in export values had largely reflected the higher prices, as export volumes had been little changed. ", " Many commodity prices had eased somewhat over the past month. Nonetheless, coal and iron ore spot prices were still 30–40 per cent above the most recently established contract prices. The Tapis crude oil price had peaked at over US$150 per barrel in mid July, but more recently had been trading around US$130 per barrel. ", " Compared with some earlier cyclical growth slowdowns, measures of confidence and household spending looked weaker, but the slowdown in the labour market and survey-based measures of business conditions had, so far at least, been relatively mild by past standards. The staff forecast for growth had been revised down slightly, while that for inflation was slightly higher in the near term but still saw inflation starting to fall back towards the target during 2009 and 2010. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that credit concerns had resurfaced in global financial markets over the past month and that financial conditions generally had deteriorated. Despite better-than-expected second-quarter earnings figures and significant new capital raisings, there had been large write-downs by several major financial institutions and some rating downgrades. ", " Credit default swap premia had widened during the month, notably early in July in response to concerns over the financial condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose share prices had declined very sharply in July, after having fallen significantly in August 2007 at the start of the credit crisis. Members were briefed on the current financial condition of the agencies and the US policy response, including the government commitment to inject equity capital if needed. ", " Members noted that the increased credit concerns had not been reflected in money market spreads for the US dollar and the euro, which had not changed much in July. In Australia, money market spreads had narrowed in the most recent period. ", " Global share markets had been volatile over the past month, with equity prices down a little after the large decline in June. ", " In Australia, the share prices of financial stocks had fallen significantly over the past month, particularly following the announcements of large provisions by NAB and the ANZ Bank. The magnitude of the fall in the ASX 200 since its peak in November – 28 per cent – was quite substantial by historical standards. Members noted that, notwithstanding the increased provisions made by some Australian banks, underlying profits for the major banks were still likely to be strong for the latest half-year period. Members noted that the banks had increased standard variable housing loan rates by 15 basis points in the past month. ", " In considering developments in capital markets, members observed that the pace of bond issuance by Australian banks had slowed a little in the past few months, but was still solid and the banks remained well ahead on their funding needs. There had been further issuance of bonds in the domestic residential mortgage-backed securities market; although volumes had been low, spreads appeared to have stabilised somewhat. ", " Members observed that major foreign exchange markets had remained relatively calm over the past month. In Asia, the authorities in some countries had intervened to support their exchange rates. The renminbi had continued to appreciate gradually and had risen considerably against the currencies of several of China's Asian trading partners over the past year. ", " The Australian dollar reached new highs in mid July, both against the US dollar and measured on a trade-weighted basis. However, it had since depreciated to end about 3 per cent lower over the month, as many global commodity prices eased and markets revised down their expectations for Australian interest rates. Market expectations about monetary policy in Australia had changed significantly in the past month, reflecting the accumulating evidence of slower demand in the economy. The market had now fully priced in a cut in the cash rate by October, with a further cut by February. ", " Overseas, markets still expected the US Fed to tighten over the year ahead, though expectations of a near-term tightening had dissipated. Markets expected no further change by the European Central Bank following its tightening in July; Japanese monetary policy was also expected to remain on hold. Further easing was expected in New Zealand following the rate cut in July. ", " Yields on government bonds in the major markets had been volatile in the past month, reflecting the competing concerns of rising inflationary risks and the effects of the renewed credit disruption. Over the month, the spread between US bond yields and those in Australia had narrowed from its highs. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was to leave the cash rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent. ", " In evaluating the recommendation, members noted that there had clearly been a significant change in trend in household demand over the preceding few months. Tight financial conditions, high petrol prices and declining asset values were all contributing factors, though petrol prices had recently declined somewhat and tax cuts had taken effect. A range of business surveys suggested that conditions across most sectors had also moderated, though the slowing seemed milder than in the case of household activity. The national accounts for the June quarter, to be published in early September, were likely to show that growth of GDP had been low, and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the September quarter was also possible. There were some early signs of slowing in the labour market. In addition, while global economic growth in the first half of the year had been reasonable in aggregate, over the past month there had been signs of weaker conditions in more of the major economies. Moreover, the effects of the global credit market disruption had intensified again recently, and this had led to a further tightening of financial conditions domestically over the past few weeks. ", " Members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation, as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions. Tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but, on the other hand, the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially to national income and capacity to spend. On balance, it was now looking more likely that demand would remain on a slower track, and economic growth would be fairly slow, over the period ahead. ", " The staff forecast for growth of the Australian economy over the year ahead had been lowered slightly and remained below consensus. It was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future, but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010. Clear evidence of that decline beginning, however, was unlikely to be seen for a while yet. ", " In assessing the implications for monetary policy of the latest information on the economy and the revised forecasts for growth and inflation, members focused on two key considerations. ", " First, a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring, with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting, though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date. If that occurred, the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater. Policy had to take account of this risk, particularly given both the recent high CPI reading and those in prospect in the near term. This argued for maintaining the current stance of policy. ", " Second, members were conscious that financial conditions were clearly quite tight, and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders' cost of funds in the market. Given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour, confidence was weaker, asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect, tighter financial conditions were not warranted. Indeed, less restrictive conditions could soon be called for, otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase. On these considerations, a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate. ", " Weighing up all these considerations, members judged that the current stance of policy was appropriate for the time being. Nonetheless, given the slower trend in demand, scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing.

GDP growth in the June quarter had been revised up to 0.8 per cent from the initial estimate of 0.5 per cent, with growth over the year now estimated at a little above 2 per cent. Growth had been boosted by exports, following the substantial depreciation of the US dollar. Although the tax cuts earlier in the year had supported consumption and allowed a rise in the saving ratio in the June quarter, the recent monthly data indicated falls in consumption in real terms in June and July. The housing sector had subtracted sizeably from growth over the past year. However, there was some evidence of a slowing in the rate of decline in house prices, house sales and housing starts, which suggested that the subtraction from growth from residential investment spending would ease. ", " Conditions in the US labour market painted a somewhat weaker picture of growth than the GDP data. Employment had fallen each month so far this year and the unemployment rate had risen significantly. ", " The run-up in oil prices around mid year had resulted in a sharp increase in the CPI in the United States in June and July, but the more recent falls in oil prices were expected to lead to a fall in CPI inflation. Similar trends were being seen in many other economies. ", " GDP data for the other major economies in the June quarter painted a consistent picture of slowing growth. ", " In the euro area, GDP had fallen, as the three largest economies had contracted. Confidence among consumers and businesses had fallen significantly over the past year, reflecting the effects of rapidly rising energy prices and negative news from the finance sector. There had been a similar pattern of slowing GDP in the United Kingdom, with essentially no growth in the June quarter. ", " The Japanese economy had contracted by about ½ per cent in the June quarter, with a broad-based slowing in growth to 1 per cent over the year. ", " In China, there had been a slight slowing in GDP growth to around 10 per cent on a year-ended basis. Although growth in industrial production and exports had fallen, reflecting softer demand in China's major trading partners, the retail sales data suggested there had been a pick-up in real spending since the start of the year. ", " GDP growth in India slowed in the June quarter, though growth over the year had remained robust at about 8 per cent. ", " In east Asia, weaker exports and slowing domestic demand resulted in a moderation in growth in the June quarter. The moderation had occurred in most of the economies of the region, where monetary policy was now being tightened in response to rising inflation. ", " Overall, members assessed growth in the major developed economies to be soft, while conditions in the larger emerging economies were slowing a little, but were still solid. They noted the staff estimate of growth in Australia's trading partners in the June quarter of around ½ per cent, and about 4 per cent over the year. External forecasts for growth of the world economy in 2009 were being revised down closer to the staff forecast published in the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, which was for growth of 3¾ per cent for Australia's trading partners. ", " World oil prices had eased further over the past month, from a peak of around US$150 per barrel to a little below US$120 per barrel for Tapis crude, the relevant benchmark for Australian petrol prices. Members noted that the depreciation of the Australian dollar meant the full effect of lower US dollar crude oil prices was not being felt by Australian households. ", " Members discussed recent trends in spot commodity prices. The weakening world economy was weighing on commodity prices, with spot prices for coal and iron ore below the peaks reached in July. However, current spot prices for thermal coal were still well above the latest contract prices. Although refined metals and rural prices had fallen from the levels of a few months ago, rural prices in particular were significantly higher than the average of the past few years. "], "Prices and Wages": [" There had not been much new data on prices over the past month. Petrol prices had fallen significantly following the decline in the oil price, but the average of petrol prices in the September quarter to date still implied a small contribution to the September quarter CPI, assuming petrol prices remained at their current levels during the month of September. ", " Data on wages had been mixed. The wage price index had shown a relatively large 1.2 per cent increase in the June quarter, but this had followed a small increase in the March quarter and the year-ended rate of growth of 4.2 per cent was in the range of the past few years. Members observed that there had been a significant divergence in wage growth within sectors and states, and that measures capturing bonuses were running ahead of measures of base pay. Private-sector wages growth had drifted up to 4.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter, with this being offset by a fall in the growth of public-sector wages to about 3.8 per cent. ", " Other measures of wage growth from the average weekly earnings survey had not shown any evidence of upward drift, though these series had been highly volatile. Broadly, wage growth at present was seen as being at the upper end of the range in the inflation-targeting period. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members considered the information provided by the run of regular monthly data releases, covering household consumption, the housing sector, the labour market and the business and external sectors. ", " There were no updated figures on retail spending from those discussed at the previous meeting, which had shown weakness over the year to June. Liaison with retailers conducted by the Bank's staff suggested that activity in the retail sector was somewhat stronger on average in July and August. However, there was considerable variation among types of retailers and retail spending overall remained subdued. Another monthly indicator of consumption was motor vehicle sales. These figures had clearly slowed since the start of the year and the recent weakness did not appear to be purely due to the changes in the luxury car tax. Consumer sentiment had increased modestly in August, after earlier steep falls to well below average levels. ", " In the housing sector, data on building approvals for July, which were released during the meeting, indicated no change in the current downward trend in housing activity. Information on house prices suggested that average nationwide prices had fallen over the three months to July. Other indicators of activity in the secondary housing market had remained subdued. ", " Housing loan approvals continued to slow in July and housing credit expansion was now running at about 0.5 per cent a month. A broader measure of household credit also showed subdued growth, at an annualised pace of 5 per cent. ", " Turning to the labour market, members observed that, despite year-ended growth of employment of 2.4 per cent, the run of monthly data suggested a weakening trend. The unemployment rate, at 4.3 per cent in July, was now a little above the low point seen earlier in the year. Newspaper job advertisements had been falling for several months and internet vacancies had also begun to ease, though the labour market was still tight given the high level of vacancies. ", " On the business sector, members observed that the NAB survey suggested that overall business conditions had now fallen from peak levels to below average. The more subjective measure of business confidence remained well below average. Capacity utilisation had eased, but was still at a high level. ", " Growth in lending to businesses remained weak. In recent months total business debt had been rising at an annualised rate of about 5 per cent, which was a significant slowing from the experience of the previous few years. Members observed that the pick-up in borrowing from banks in the latter part of 2007 was partly a result of financial reintermediation owing to the credit crisis, but was also boosted by new lending to fund mergers and acquisitions deals that had been announced earlier in 2007. Growth in lending to large businesses from foreign-owned banks had slowed by more than lending by domestically owned banks. ", " A large rise in export receipts in the June quarter, which mainly reflected higher prices for key commodity exports, had led to a modest trade surplus in that quarter. Some further increase in export prices was expected in the September quarter as the recent price increases were fully passed through. As a result of the developments in the trade balance, the current account deficit narrowed significantly in the June quarter. ", " Profits of non-financial companies had increased strongly in the June quarter, especially in the mining sector. Preliminary estimates suggested that business investment had risen solidly in the June quarter. The latest capital expenditure survey indicated that investment intentions among businesses for 2008/09 had risen strongly, in mining as well as other sectors, to be well ahead of similar estimates made a year earlier. These intentions suggested a very large rise in nominal spending on investment in the current financial year, though the results of this survey were usually associated with a high degree of uncertainty. Taken at face value, there would be a further increase in the already-high share of investment in GDP, which was difficult to reconcile with confidence measures from other business surveys. One possibility was that many business surveys underweighted the importance of the mining sector in the overall economy at present, but it was also possible that investment intentions might be scaled back over the course of the year. ", " With the national accounts for the June quarter to be released the next day, discussion on the domestic economy concluded with members being briefed about the partial data released in the few days prior to the meeting and during the meeting. These data pointed to a modest rise in GDP in the quarter. "], "Financial Markets": [" A major development in financial markets over the past month was the appreciation of the US dollar from its recent historic low levels, which had been reached after several years of depreciation against the other major currencies. There was no simple explanation for the reversal in the US dollar exchange rate, though US economic data had been more positive than those in other G7 countries and, with expectation of policy tightening in the United States and easing elsewhere, interest differentials were shifting in favour of the US dollar. ", " Taking a longer-run perspective on exchange rate movements, members observed that the US dollar remained at low levels; although it had risen by about 5 per cent over the past month, it was still lower against the currencies of most of the United States' trading partners over the past 12 months. ", " Members noted that Asian currencies were generally lower over the past month and the authorities in some countries had intervened further to support their exchange rates. The Korean won, in particular, had experienced a sharp depreciation in an environment of uncertainty about the outlook for the Korean economy. The renminbi had moved little against the US dollar in net terms over the past month, but had appreciated against the yen and euro and most other currencies, including those in the Asian region. ", " A significant development in the Australian financial market had been the continued depreciation of the Australian dollar from the peak in mid July. The fall of 7 per cent in trade-weighted terms in August was one of the largest monthly movements in recent years. The exchange rate had depreciated against all the currencies in the trade-weighted basket, though the depreciation against the euro and other European currencies had been relatively small. The depreciation had been driven by both changing market perceptions about relative interest differentials and the recent broad-based decline in commodity prices. Despite the recent movements, the Australian dollar was still a little higher in trade-weighted terms over the past year. ", " Share prices in the United States and Europe had not changed much over the past month, but equity markets were significantly lower in Asia, particularly China. In the United States, growth of corporate earnings over the year to the June quarter, excluding the financial sector, had been reasonable, though earnings of firms in the consumer discretionary sector had been weak, in line with the softening in US consumption spending. ", " In Australia, listed companies outside the financial sector had also recorded solid profit results for the first half of 2008 compared with the same period in 2007; a large fall in the profits of the broadly defined financials category meant that the profit result for the market as a whole over that period was only modest. Financials had been the worst performers in the Australian equity market over the past year, particularly complex leveraged structures holding infrastructure assets. ", " Members noted that credit concerns had remained elevated over the past month. The concerns had been manifested in credit default swap indexes remaining high, particularly for US bonds, prompted by continued uncertainty over the financial condition of the US mortgage agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and some large US investment banks, whose credit default swap premia had risen sharply in the past few months. ", " Issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the United States had virtually dried up, which had exacerbated the credit difficulties confronting the housing market; the only issuance of note at present was by the mortgage agencies. ", " Members noted that the increased credit concerns in bond markets had not been seen in movements in money market spreads for the US dollar and the euro; although these were largely unchanged in August, they remained relatively high. Corporate spreads had widened over the past month, including for highly rated bonds. ", " In reviewing market expectations for policy rates, members observed that there had been little change in the three major economies. The US Fed was still expected to tighten a little, while no change was expected in the euro area and Japan. However, expectations had moved towards lower rates in the next few months in Canada and the United Kingdom, and also in New Zealand. ", " In Australia, there had been a marked change in policy expectations over the past few months. Currently, the market expected a cut at this meeting and a couple more by the end of the year. The changing expectations had seen the 90-day bank bill yield decline by about 60 basis points over the past month. The spread between bank bill rates and the expected cash rate had declined, reflecting an easing in money market tensions. Bond yields had also declined over the past month. ", " Members noted that bond issuance by the major Australian banks had continued at a reasonable pace in August, including several issues offshore. A large amount of bonds was due to mature around the world in the next few months, which would lead to a considerable rise in global issuance and could put pressure on the costs faced by banks. In recent months, domestic bond pricing spreads at issuance had remained relatively high, but with the benchmarks for pricing having fallen, the cost of new issuance had been somewhat lower. There had been minimal issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities. ", " The banks had been bidding keenly for term funding. Deposit rates had been raised over the past year and banks had been offering particularly high rates on ‘specials’ in the past month. Despite this, the reduction in short- and longer-term funding costs had allowed banks to lower fixed lending rates on several products. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for a reduction in the cash rate of 25 basis points to 7.0 per cent. ", " In considering this recommendation, members discussed the possible effects of the opposing forces confronting the domestic economy. The tightening in financial conditions, owing to increases in the cash rate and rises in the cost of funds in financial markets, together with higher oil prices, had worked to dampen demand and economic activity. Household sector spending was weak, with wealth having fallen and higher interest rates and tighter credit standards impinging on spending decisions. Business conditions had noticeably softened since the middle of the year and confidence and credit growth to both households and businesses was now quite modest. Indicators of capacity utilisation, while still high, had declined and there had also been some signs of an easing in labour market conditions. ", " But investment spending had been strong and surveys of investment intentions indicated it would rise further in the year ahead. Overall, the picture seemed to be one of weak consumption and strong investment, but with aggregate growth of demand slowing. Members noted also that there was still considerable stimulus to domestic activity coming from the external sector. The run-up in commodity prices had increased Australia's terms of trade, adding substantially to national income and capacity to spend. Looking ahead, however, the world economy was slowing and it was therefore unlikely that the external stimulus to Australia would be as strong in the year ahead. ", " In weighing these various factors, members concluded that the slowdown in demand the Board had been seeking was unfolding. A necessary precondition for a decline in inflation back towards the target was therefore in place, even though evidence for that decline would not be seen in the figures for some time. This outlook was predicated on continued restraint in wage demands, helped by some softening in labour market conditions. ", " Given that assessment, and that financial conditions had been quite tight – and had tightened a little further recently – the question then became at what point it would be prudent to move to a less restrictive setting of monetary policy. There were risks in easing too soon, since the evidence for the expected fall in inflation was still some time away. Moreover, as inflation needed to fall a significant way to be consistent with the target, policy could need to be on the restrictive side of normal for some time ahead. ", " However, there were also risks in waiting too long to have some easing of policy from a quite restrictive setting. In that event, demand could weaken more sharply than necessary. This would deliver a faster reduction in inflation, but at greater short-term economic cost. ", " Policy had to balance these risks. After considering all the evidence, the Board came to the view this balance was best achieved by reducing the cash rate at this meeting.

The global slowdown was highly synchronised, suggesting a common economic shock. The collapse of Lehman Brothers, with the ensuing financial turmoil, had been associated with a sharp fall in confidence and spending. The IMF had recently again revised down its forecasts for the world economy. The G7 economies were now forecast to contract by 2 per cent in 2009, with the rest of the world forecast to grow well below trend; if realised, the forecast for world growth of 0.5 per cent in 2009 would be the weakest year since World War II. The largest forecast revisions on this occasion had been for some of the smaller Asian economies, which to date had shown relatively good growth. ", " Members observed that world inflation was falling noticeably. Lower headline CPI readings in many countries had been driven by falls in oil prices, but core measures of inflation, which excluded food and energy, were also falling. ", " Turning to developments in individual economies, members noted that the 1 per cent fall in US GDP in the December quarter had been the result of weakness in private spending. Confidence overall was weak and the adverse dynamics of the housing cycle were still unfolding; housing activity and prices had continued to fall in recent months. The US labour market had weakened sharply late in 2008. ", " Japanese industrial production had fallen by 20 per cent over the December quarter. A similar decline had been recorded for export volumes. It was likely that a significant fall in GDP would be reported in due course. ", " GDP in China grew by 6.8 per cent over the course of 2008. Members were informed that the staff estimate of the quarterly growth profile indicated a sharp slowing from the high rates of previous years. Industrial production and export volumes had fallen sharply towards the end of the year. There had been a similar pattern of large falls in industrial production and exports in the smaller Asian economies, no doubt partly reflecting the integrated supply chain in Asia. ", " The euro area was experiencing significant economic weakness. Industrial and consumer sentiment fell sharply in the December quarter. In the United Kingdom, GDP fell by 1½ per cent in the December quarter, following a fall in the previous quarter. The near-term outlook was for further weakness, in part resulting from the severe problems in the financial services sector, which accounted for a higher-than-average share of the UK economy. ", " Members observed that oil prices had fallen markedly in the December quarter, but had stabilised somewhat in recent weeks. Movements in other commodity prices, including prices for base metals and rural commodities, had shown a broadly similar pattern in the past few months. Members regarded this as a possible indicator that global economic activity had not continued to deteriorate at the same pace as in the December quarter. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The discussion on the domestic economy commenced with an assessment of conditions in Australia relative to other industrial economies. Overall, members' assessment was that the deterioration in Australian economic activity to date had not been as marked as in other economies. ", " Over the year to the September quarter, real domestic demand had grown by a relatively strong 4 per cent, while GDP had grown by around 2 per cent. Demand had, until then, been sustained by very strong growth in real gross domestic income, which had been boosted by the strong rise in the terms of trade. The more recent collapse of commodity prices meant that this effect was now working in reverse. More generally, members noted that while the path of domestic economic activity had changed abruptly after September, it had not so far weakened to the same extent as overseas. Based on the currently available indicators, it was likely that GDP would be broadly flat in the December quarter, a relatively good result in comparison with other developed economies. ", " The run of regular data releases reviewed by the Board covered the business, household and housing sectors, the labour market, and prices and wages. ", " In the business sector, indicators from a range of business surveys suggested that investment spending was likely to slow markedly in the current financial year after the strong outcomes of recent years. Members were briefed that plans for future investment appeared to have been scaled back sharply in the December quarter. Business surveys suggested a fall to well below average levels. Data on approvals for non-residential building fell in the December quarter. ", " Turning to other indicators, members noted that there had been a large fall in business confidence, as measured by the NAB survey, in October and November. This took confidence to a level below that seen in the early 1990s. However, the survey's measure of business conditions had fallen by a lesser extent, and capacity utilisation had eased only gradually over the past year, from a record level to about average. ", " Growth in business credit had slowed sharply from the very high rates of a year ago. In fact, business credit outstanding had fallen in the month of December, though this appeared to have been affected by special factors. The slowing in credit probably reflected a combination of tighter lending standards and businesses seeking to reduce debt. According to the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers, businesses in this sector had found it increasingly difficult to obtain finance over the past year or so. ", " Turning to the household sector, growth in real disposable incomes had been strong last year, boosted by lower fuel prices, falls in interest rates and the fiscal transfers to households in the December quarter. However, there had been significant falls in net worth, arising mainly from falls in equity prices, and households had become more conservative in their financial decisions. Growth in debt had been slower than growth in incomes, so the debt-to-income ratio had been declining. ", " Retail sales had risen modestly in November. Liaison with retailers conducted by the staff indicated that sales had picked up noticeably in December, but it seemed that they had weakened again in January. Consumer sentiment, after having fallen sharply around September and October, had picked up a little in recent months. ", " In the housing sector, members noted that construction activity remained weak, with building approvals having fallen further in November. However, early reports were that housing loan approvals had picked up sharply in December, consistent with increased interest in display homes, which followed the recent changes to the First Home Owner Grant scheme and lower interest rates. Yet the figures for housing credit indicated a slowing trend. This suggested that households had not as yet scaled back their loan repayments after recent falls in interest rates, preferring instead to pay off debt faster. ", " In the established housing market, house prices fell by about 3 per cent on average across Australia over 2008. This was very modest compared with the falls in some other countries. The declines were widespread across the capital cities over the past year, though Adelaide was an exception. In the larger capital cities the recent falls in house prices were most pronounced at the top end of the market. ", " Conditions in the labour market were softening. While employment growth remained positive during 2008, it had slowed and trend growth was now only a little above zero. The forward indicators of job vacancies and employment intentions from business surveys indicated that further deterioration was in prospect. Thus far, however, the unemployment rate had risen only gradually from its low of 4 per cent. ", " Members were briefed on the December quarter CPI and the outlook for growth and inflation. The CPI fell in the quarter, reducing the year-ended rate to 3.7 per cent. Most of the fall was attributable to lower petrol prices, but underlying inflation also moderated, to a little over 4 per cent. The slowing in the underlying inflation rate was driven by prices of non-tradable items such as housing, rents and domestic travel. Tradables prices had been expected to pick up following the depreciation of the exchange rate, but price discounting of motor vehicles and other goods had offset this effect. ", " There had not been any new data on wages over the past two months, with wages growth currently stable at around 4 per cent. ", " Members were informed that the staff forecast was for domestic output growth to be significantly lower than previously expected. This was due to the weaker global economy and a pronounced fall in the terms of trade. Working in the other direction were the effects of the recent cuts in interest rates, which had flowed through to lending rates faster in Australia than in other countries. The forecast also incorporated the effect of an assumed fiscal expansion. ", " The weaker growth profile would place greater downward pressure on inflation, which was now forecast to decline towards 2 per cent by the middle of 2011, compared with 2½ per cent previously. In the near term, the CPI inflation rate was expected to fall rapidly, owing to a fall in petrol prices in the March quarter, if current prices were sustained. "], "Fiscal Policy": [" At this point in the meeting, the Secretary to the Treasury briefed the other members of the Board on the outline of the Government's Nation Building and Jobs package, which would be announced later that day. Members discussed various elements of the package. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that the extreme volatility of global financial markets during October and November had abated recently. There had been a noticeable improvement in conditions in credit markets following the introduction of various remedial policy measures by a range of countries. Nonetheless, sentiment remained fragile. ", " Looking at policy interest rates, there had been significant rate reductions in both developed and emerging economies over the past few months, including in most parts of Asia and Latin America. The US Federal Reserve had reduced the federal funds rate to close to zero, which meant the cumulative reduction since the onset of the financial crisis in the second half of 2007 was more than 500 basis points. With the federal funds rate at its current level, the Fed had announced a range of measures described as ‘credit easing’, which focused on the composition of its balance sheet assets and provision of support to credit markets. ", " In other economies, the European Central Bank lowered its policy rate by 75 basis points in December and by a further 50 basis points in January, to 2 per cent. The Bank of Japan had lowered its policy rate closer to zero and had introduced several measures to assist corporate financing. The Bank of England had reduced its bank rate by 150 basis points and had announced an intention to purchase financial assets directly. The Swiss National Bank, having cut rates to ½ per cent, was now contemplating additional stimulus measures. And the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had cut rates by 300 basis points, in two steps, to 3.5 per cent. ", " Members observed that in many countries the central bank rate reductions had flowed through to lending rates only to a limited extent, in particular for housing. They noted that the transmission of monetary policy changes to lending rates had been much more effective in Australia. This reflected the high share of variable rate lending in Australia and the fact that domestic financial institutions had passed on most of the recent declines in funding costs to both new and existing loans (though the pass-through to business lending rates in Australia had been slower and less complete). Members noted that US housing loan rates had declined somewhat since the announcement by the Fed that it would purchase mortgage agency paper. ", " In government bond markets, yields had fallen to post-War lows in many countries. Some European countries, however, had experienced a sharp widening of spreads relative to German government bonds. ", " There had been a large volume of government-guaranteed bank bond issuance around the world in the past few months. Australian banks had been very active, and had benefitted from strong demand for their bonds. The banks were now well ahead of their funding plans and had been able to run down short-term debt to some extent. Spreads had tended to narrow. ", " US corporate bond spreads had declined from their peaks late last year, but remained high. A similar pattern had occurred for emerging market spreads. ", " Turning to global share markets, members noted that equity prices had been fluctuating around a flat trend over December and January. Share prices were at low levels: in US and European markets they were back to levels of 2003 and 1997 respectively, while the Japanese market was back to its early 1980s level. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had depreciated since early December, but was still well above its recent lows. In other notable developments, the pound sterling had depreciated significantly and was now at parity with the euro, and the Chinese renminbi had moved broadly in line with the US dollar in the past six months. ", " The Australian dollar had traded in a wide range over the past two months. There had been little net change on a trade-weighted basis over that period, with significant appreciation against the pound and the New Zealand dollar and significant depreciation against the yen and Swiss franc. Volatility in the exchange rate was lower than in late 2008, but still relatively high. Over the past year, the Australian dollar had depreciated by over 20 per cent. Members noted that this would help to lessen the effect on the economy of the global economic slowdown. ", " Interest rates in the Australian money market had fallen considerably over the past two months as markets had increasingly priced in future easing of monetary policy. Conditions in money markets had improved. ", " The 10-year Australian government bond yield had fallen to around 4 per cent, a level last recorded in the 1950s, in line with global trends. Increased issuance of government-guaranteed bank bonds had attracted some demand away from bonds issued by the States, and there had been a widening in spreads between yields on semi-government bonds and Commonwealth Government securities. However, the level of yields on semis had nonetheless fallen to low levels. ", " Members were further briefed on the pass-through of policy changes to lending rates in Australia. Most of the December cash rate reduction had been passed on, and on this occasion the reduction had flowed on to personal and small business rates also. Members noted that lending rates were now below average. A further reduction in the cash rate following this meeting, assuming it was passed on to borrowers, would push many lending rates to their lowest levels since the 1960s. ", " Financial companies had raised a large amount of equity, particularly in the December quarter, at discounts that were relatively modest by world standards. ", " In reviewing developments in business debt, members noted that foreign banks in Australia accounted for about a quarter of business credit, and that their loans were fairly evenly spread across the sectors of the economy. The foreign bank sector accounted for a negligible amount of housing lending in Australia. Discussions with foreign banks did not as yet reveal widespread withdrawal from the Australian market. This would need to be kept under review. ", " Members noted that market expectations were for an easing in the official cash rate of 100 basis points at this meeting, with the trough in the cash rate now expected to be around 2 per cent later in the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for a reduction in the cash rate of 100 basis points to 3.25 per cent. ", " The primary backdrop to members' policy discussion this month was the marked deterioration in world economic conditions late in 2008. Members had noted at previous meetings that there had been an abrupt change to the outlook for global economic activity after September, following Lehman's collapse and the resultant strains in financial markets and declines in asset values. This had caused a collapse of household and business confidence and a very sharp fall in global demand. The dependence of Asian economies on manufactured exports meant that they had been severely affected. Domestic demand in Asia had also weakened sharply. This included the Chinese economy, which, though still growing, had slowed markedly. These effects were becoming evident in the economic data that had recently been released. The weakness had in turn been reflected in a further significant downward revision to the IMF's forecasts for growth in both developed and emerging economies in 2009, which was now expected to be the weakest in six decades. ", " Members noted that measures taken in developed economies to stabilise their financial systems had contributed to an improvement in the functioning of credit markets over the past few months. There had also been greater steadiness in commodity markets since November. The better functioning of markets plus the very significant monetary and fiscal stimulus that was being put in place in all regions would assist in promoting global recovery over time. Nonetheless, the near-term outlook was very weak. ", " Economic conditions in Australia were being affected by these global events, though, to date, the Australian economy had been more resilient than other industrial economies. Importantly, Australia's financial system remained in a relatively strong condition. Among other things, this had allowed the significant monetary policy easing starting in September to flow through to large reductions in many lending rates. Nonetheless, the headwinds from the global economy were very strong and would continue to have a significant negative effect on the domestic economy in the near term. ", " Members noted that the package of fiscal measures to be announced by the Government later that day would result in a significant boost to demand during 2009. Even so, given the contractionary forces coming from abroad and the clear evidence that inflation was on a downward trend again, members judged that another substantial easing of monetary policy at this time was appropriate. They supported the recommendation for a cut of 100 basis points. ", " Members agreed that, together with earlier rate cuts, this would amount to a very significant easing of monetary policy. This had occurred relatively early in the business cycle and lending rates in many cases would soon be at generational lows. ", " Together with the fiscal measures, this meant that a very significant macroeconomic stimulus had been applied to the domestic economy. This stimulus would take time to be effective and could be expected to have only a modest effect on the near-term outlook in Australia. Given the speed at which the global contraction had occurred, short-term prospects were thus still for weakness in demand and output. Nonetheless, the substantial measures taken would help to cushion the economy from the contractionary forces coming from abroad and, over time, work to establish conditions conducive to stronger demand later in the year. Assessments of those medium-term prospects, as well as the course of the short-term data, would be important to future policy decisions.

Output in Australia's trading partners, weighted by their share in world GDP, therefore appeared likely to have declined by around 3 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Revised forecasts from international agencies such as the IMF and OECD now showed an expected fall in output in 2009, for the first time in at least 60 years. The IMF forecasts were for growth of around 2 per cent in 2010, which implicitly assumed a return to growth in the second half of 2009. The latest global growth forecasts of the Bank's staff were more pessimistic for the current year. ", " Members noted that there were some signs of growth in the latest international economic data. However, these were tentative and prospects for global recovery still depended on the financial sector being restored to health. ", " Turning to individual economies, members noted that recent data on consumption in the United States pointed to some recovery in retail spending in the first two months of 2009, following large falls in the December quarter. News in relation to the housing sector included a modest rise in housing starts in February and a further decline in the stock of unsold new houses. Labour market conditions remained very weak, with a further large fall in non-farm payrolls in March and a rise in the unemployment rate to 8½ per cent. Coincident indicators of activity suggested that GDP in the March quarter would be likely to fall by around the same rate as in the December quarter. ", " In Asia, the economic news from Japan remained very poor. A further sharp fall in industrial production in February took the overall decline in the past few months to nearly 40 per cent, with production now around the level prevailing in the early 1980s. In China, however, there had been signs of improvement in the economic data, with a key measure of business activity picking up relatively sharply in the past two months. Steel production had also increased, as had industrial production more generally, though the timing of the Chinese New Year meant these data needed to be interpreted with caution. Elsewhere in east Asia, key monthly indicators of production and exports appeared to have bottomed in the early months of 2009 after very sharp falls in the December quarter. ", " Members noted that the latest economic data from Europe were less encouraging. GDP growth and overall sentiment showed little sign of improvement in the euro area, and industrial production had fallen steeply in eastern Europe in the past few months. ", " Conditions in the New Zealand economy were weak. GDP was almost 2 per cent lower over 2008, having fallen in each quarter during the year. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members were briefed on the main features of the December quarter national accounts, which had been released on the day following the previous meeting. Output had declined by 0.5 per cent in the quarter, though GDP rose by 0.3 per cent over the course of 2008. Non-farm GDP had been somewhat weaker in the quarter, and higher output in the farm sector had supported overall GDP. The latest set of indicators suggested that GDP was likely to have fallen again in the March quarter. ", " Members then considered in detail the information provided by the more timely data releases. ", " Retail sales had fallen in February, but, as this had followed strong growth in the previous two months, the level of sales was still higher than prior to the fiscal stimulus late in 2008. The year-ended growth of retail sales in New South Wales was now approaching that of the rest of the country, after a period of over a year in which it had lagged considerably. Household spending had been supported by a sharp decline in interest payments. As a share of household disposable income, these had fallen by several percentage points in the past six months. However, household net worth was estimated to have fallen further in the March quarter. Members noted that consumer sentiment in Australia had fallen by significantly less than the average for some major economies, where indicators of consumer sentiment were now well below those seen in the early 1990s. This was not the case in Australia. ", " In the housing sector, indicators pointed to weakness in building activity in the first half of this year, though increasing demand from first-home buyers was supporting parts of the established housing market. Building approvals had increased in February, but remained at low levels. There had been a sharp rise in the number of grants to first-home buyers, following the increase in the size of the grant. On house prices, indications were that the top end of the market was soft but the lower end had firmed, owing to strong demand from first-home buyers. ", " Members were briefed that business investment had continued to grow in the December quarter, with growth over the year of more than 10 per cent. However, survey information indicated that investment plans had been scaled back considerably in the past few months. This was likely to show up in the data on actual investment during the course of this year. Non-residential building approvals had fallen very sharply over the past year or so; although construction activity had increased over 2008, it was likely to fall in the period ahead. ", " Business conditions were weak in the early months of the year. Activity in the manufacturing sector remained well below average levels. Business debt funding had fallen, with businesses repaying debt in net terms in the past two months, for the first time in 15 years. There was some evidence that the decline in business credit was largely due to weaker demand for loans. ", " On a more positive note, members observed that metals prices had stabilised since late 2008, with prices for several base metals having risen noticeably in the past month or so. Indicators of freight costs had also stabilised after falling very rapidly in the second half of 2008, which suggested the decline in world trade had been arrested. Despite these signs of stability in external demand, the falls in commodity prices over 2008 meant that the terms of trade were forecast to fall during the period ahead, as new contracts for coal and iron ore came into effect. However, the expected level of the terms of trade over the next year or so was still relatively high. ", " Conditions in the labour market had continued to soften. While part-time employment had increased in recent months, the full-time component had fallen steadily since mid 2008 and the unemployment rate had risen. Further falls in employment and rises in unemployment were expected. ", " Despite the weakening labour market, wages, as measured by average earnings in the national accounts, had risen by around 6 per cent over 2008, well above its recent average. Members were briefed, however, that the wage price index gave a more accurate picture of wage developments. This series had increased by around 4¼ per cent over the year to the December quarter. Moreover, measures of labour costs from a range of business surveys indicated that wage growth was expected to moderate in the period ahead. ", " Members were informed that there had been further downward revisions to the staff forecasts for growth and inflation. GDP was expected to fall in 2009 but increase again in 2010. The revised outlook for growth, and the associated reduced level of capacity utilisation, would entail stronger downward pressure on medium-term inflation than previously forecast. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that sentiment in global financial markets had fluctuated during March. Initially, sentiment in the major markets fell as concerns about the health of financial institutions again came to the fore, but it improved following the announcement of details of the US plan to stabilise its financial system. Subsequent positive earnings announcements by some US banks had also helped. ", " As a result of the lift in sentiment, equity markets rose noticeably in net terms over the course of March. There was a strong rally in equity prices in emerging markets. In Australia, equity prices rose generally in line with those in other industrial countries, with most of the rise attributable to higher prices of shares in the resources and financial sectors. ", " Global bond yields had fallen after the announcement by the Federal Reserve that it would increase its bond purchases. However, some of this fall had subsequently been reversed. ", " Looking at monetary policy settings around the world, members were informed that although the European Central Bank had lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points, which was less than had been expected by the market, the effective euro area interbank rate had fallen significantly below the policy rate and the central bank's balance sheet had expanded. Along with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan had moved further to implement unconventional policy measures to stimulate borrowing and economic activity in Japan. Elsewhere in industrial countries, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada had lowered rates by 50 basis points, and the Swiss National Bank had reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points and was purchasing corporate bonds. While there was now little scope for lower policy rates in most industrial countries, over the past month there had been significant monetary policy easing in many emerging economies. ", " In Australia, conditions in credit markets had become more positive over the past month. Spreads on short-term debt had fallen considerably. In other signs of generally improving conditions, banks' demand for funds at the Reserve Bank had declined, leading to exchange settlement balances settling at around $3 billion and a run-off in term deposits at the Bank. ", " Turning to bond issuance, members noted that there had been strong non-financial corporate bond issuance in the United States in the first quarter of 2009 across the rating spectrum; financials had also done a considerable amount of issuance. ", " In Australia, there had been several large bond issues over the past month, including some retail issues. Spreads were high, but there were signs that investors' appetite for corporate debt may have improved somewhat. There had also been a high level of equity raisings in Australia in the first quarter, notably by non-financial companies. Members observed that activity in the syndicated lending market had been largely confined to refinancing of existing facilities, but both Australian and foreign lenders had participated. ", " Issuance of guaranteed bank debt had continued to grow rapidly globally, though issuance by Australian banks had dropped back somewhat in the past month after being very strong in the preceding three months. Recent issues by Australian banks had been mostly onshore and included an unguaranteed issue at a competitive spread relative to guaranteed issues. Overall, the Australian banks remained well ahead of schedule on bond funding; deposit growth had also been strong. ", " Turning to the major foreign currency markets, members noted that there had been a sizeable net depreciation of the US dollar over the past month. Nonetheless, the US dollar was still significantly higher than a year ago. ", " Improved sentiment in global markets had led to increased demand for the Australian dollar. The currency had appreciated against the US dollar over the past month, towards the peaks seen late in 2008. The trade-weighted index was about 7 per cent higher, with a particularly large appreciation against the yen. ", " Market expectations for the outcome of this meeting were divided, but the most common view was for a 50 basis points cut in the cash rate. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" It was clear from the information that had become available over the past month that the very sharp contraction in the global economy in the final quarter of 2008 had continued during the first few months of this year. Forecasts for growth in both the industrial and emerging economies for 2009 and 2010 accordingly had been marked down further. Members noted, however, there was now considerable economic policy stimulus in place in most countries, which could be expected to support recovery over time. Tentative signs of improvement could be seen in some indicators for several countries, but it was too early yet to judge how durable they would prove to be. ", " Conditions and sentiment in global financial markets had continued to improve gradually over the past month. The improvement, which had included a sizeable rally in equity markets, had been helped by the announcements of more detailed plans for a resolution of banking system difficulties in the United States and other major countries. However, it would take time for the world financial system to be restored to health. In the near term, the contraction in economic activity would affect the quality of assets on the books of financial institutions. ", " Domestically, information over the past month had confirmed that the economy had contracted in the December quarter, though the fall in GDP had been considerably less than that of Australia's trading partners. Data for the March quarter thus far suggested another weak outcome for demand and output, though members noted that consumption had held up relatively well following the boost to spending late in 2008. Credit growth had slowed, with both reduced demand and tighter lending standards playing a role. The exception to this soft picture was credit for owner‑occupied housing, which had picked up owing to increased lending to first-home buyers. ", " As a consequence of the contraction in aggregate demand and output, capacity utilisation had continued to decline and the demand for labour had weakened. Members noted that the staff forecast for growth had been revised lower from that published in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. Inflation over the medium term was expected to continue to decline. ", " Given this background, the question for the Board was whether there was a case for additional monetary easing. In discussing this question, members noted that there had already been a major easing in both monetary and fiscal policy in Australia in the past six months. Interest rates on loans to households and many businesses were now at low levels by historical standards. The interest rate reductions had lowered debt‑servicing burdens considerably, particularly for households. This stimulus, together with the substantial fiscal measures, would support demand and help to foster economic recovery in due course. Nonetheless, the effect of recent international and domestic information had been that the near-term outlook for demand and output in Australia was now weaker than earlier expected, though a recovery in demand was likely towards the end of the year. A period of low capacity utilisation and a weaker labour market was seen as increasing the likelihood of a decline in inflation over the medium term. As such, members saw scope for a modest reduction in the cash rate. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.0 per cent, effective 8 April 2009. "]}},

The IMF had published revised forecasts for the global economy in April. World GDP was now expected to fall by 1.3 per cent in 2009, driven by a large fall in output in the G7 economies. The downward revision to forecasts for 2009 reflected the weak outcomes over the first few months of the year in many economies, with the forecasts implying a return to growth over the second half of the year. Growth was, however, expected to be low for some time; the forecast growth for 2010 was 1.9 per cent, with a return to around trend rates of growth not expected until 2011. Members observed that this meant that excess capacity in the global economy was likely to be wound back only gradually. ", " Industrial production was still falling in the United States and the euro area, though there were some signs that the rate of decline was slowing. However, conditions were brighter in Asia. Industrial production in China had recovered strongly in the past few months to surpass the previous peak. Production was also rising in other east Asian economies, after falling steeply late last year. ", " Turning to individual economies, members noted that preliminary data showed a fall of 1.6 per cent in GDP in the United States in the March quarter, similar to that recorded in the December quarter. There had been large declines in both dwelling and business investment in the March quarter, but consumption had increased by ½ per cent after sharp declines in the second half of 2008. The large falls in employment in recent months had led to a rise in the unemployment rate to 8½ per cent in March, although there were signs that the rate of deterioration in the labour market had stabilised. Members noted that there were also other signs that the rate of contraction in the US economy had slowed, with the ISM surveys of business conditions in the manufacturing and other sectors showing some improvement. It was also possible that the deterioration in the housing sector over the past three years was coming to an end, with housing starts levelling out and some measures of housing prices showing small increases, after large declines. ", " Output had fallen very sharply over the past year in the United Kingdom. Conditions in the manufacturing and housing sectors had been weak and the budget deficit had increased significantly. However, there were some tentative signs of the housing downturn coming to an end, with loan approvals picking up from very low levels and housing prices showing some signs of bottoming. ", " Economic conditions in the euro area remained very weak. Sentiment had remained at a very low level in the early months of 2009, and the unemployment rate had increased to 8.9 per cent in March. Labour market conditions had deteriorated significantly in Spain, where a substantial decline in construction activity was under way. The unemployment rate had also increased noticeably in Ireland. ", " Turning to Asia, confidence among consumers and businesses in Japan remained very low and industrial production was at the lowest level in 20 years. ", " In contrast, recent data in China had been much more positive. Output growth had picked up in the March quarter, after a substantial slowing in the second half of 2008. Industrial production had also recorded a significant increase recently. For members, a key question was whether this was due to domestic demand, reflecting the large public investment program, or a build-up in inventories. At this stage the answer was not clear. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, exports had begun to pick up in most economies following the very steep falls in the fourth quarter of 2008. GDP had stabilised in Korea in the March quarter, following a fall of 5 per cent in the December quarter. Members noted that this would have been assisted by stimulatory macroeconomic policy settings and the depreciation of the exchange rate. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" No new retail sales figures had been released over the past month. Liaison conducted by the staff suggested that retail conditions had been relatively strong in March, but mixed in April. Members noted that the sharp falls in expenditure on consumer durables over the past year in Australia had been preceded by an extended period of very strong growth in this component since 2002. This growth reflected, among other things, declines in the relative prices of many of these goods and substantial increases in household wealth. Trends in the US had been similar. ", " Consumer sentiment remained well below average, although it had improved a little recently and was considerably better than in other countries. Members noted that consumers' stated views on the medium-term prospects for the economy remained quite optimistic. ", " Turning to the housing sector, building approvals had recently picked up, which was confirmed by figures for March released during the meeting, with a significant increase in first-home buyers purchasing newly constructed homes. The latest ABS data on nationwide house prices showed a fall in the March quarter, though private-sector data for the same period had shown little change. Members noted that while house prices in the most expensive suburbs had fallen significantly over the past year, prices in the least expensive suburbs had risen recently. ", " In the business sector, the measure of business confidence from the NAB survey had increased sharply in March, reversing much of the decline following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September last year. However, business conditions remained relatively weak, with many respondents noting that a lack of demand was a significant restraint on output. A number of indicators suggested that the outlook for business investment was quite weak: imports of capital goods had declined sharply; business surveys revealed that expectations for business investment were well below average; and private non-residential building approvals had fallen sharply in the early part of 2009, though data released during the meeting suggested a significant rise in the month of March. Members noted that despite significant falls in investment expected in the current and following year, the level of investment as a share of GDP was not expected to decline to the levels seen in some previous downturns. ", " Business credit had contracted in three of the past four months, though total business debt funding was not as weak, as some companies had accessed capital markets directly. Members noted that both demand and supply factors were important; businesses were looking to reduce debt, but it was also more difficult for them to obtain funds in an environment in which lending standards were being tightened. Members also noted the difficulties in the securitisation market and recent trends in lending by different types of banks. ", " Turning to the external sector, the terms of trade were declining because of lower commodity prices, but even so were at a historically high level. Export volumes had held up much better than expected; they were estimated to have been stable in the March quarter. Members noted the key role of China in Australia's export performance. ", " Conditions in the labour market had continued to weaken, with the unemployment rate increasing by ½ percentage point to 5.7 per cent in March. Forward-looking indicators suggested further declines in total employment were in prospect in the months ahead. ", " Members were briefed on the March quarter CPI, which had recorded a small rise in the quarter, with the year-ended increase declining to 2½ per cent. The result was largely attributable to reductions in petrol prices and a large fall in the ABS estimate of the price of financial intermediation services, which has tended to move broadly in line with movements in the cash rate. Excluding this component, the CPI would have increased by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter. Measures of underlying inflation were around 1 per cent in the quarter, down from around 1¼ per cent in the middle of 2008. The effect of the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate had limited the reduction in inflation. Members noted that movements in producer prices in the March quarter, combined with reduced capacity constraints, suggested that pressure on prices was easing. Consumers' inflation expectations were also around the lowest level seen in the past decade, after being quite high in 2008. ", " There had not been any new official data on wages over the past month, but wage growth was expected to ease given the softening in the labour market. ", " The staff forecasts of growth and inflation had been updated following the release of the CPI. They had not changed materially from those presented to the Board at the previous meeting, and continued to show a gradual pick-up in the economy from late 2009. The recovery was, however, expected to be relatively subdued, reflecting developments abroad. Growth was not expected to be above trend until 2011. Inflation was forecast to decline gradually over the next few years to below 2 per cent, with the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation last year continuing to hold up inflation over the remainder of 2009. "], "Financial Markets": [" Sentiment in global financial markets had continued to improve during April. This was reflected in rises in global equity markets, better conditions in credit markets, and an appreciation of the Australian dollar and currencies of emerging market economies. There had also been an increased amount of non-guaranteed bond issuance by banks, including Australian banks. However, the improvement in sentiment remained vulnerable to setbacks, with the impending release of the results of stress tests for the 19 largest US financial institutions a potential hurdle. These results were due to be published in coming days and could indicate that several large banks required significant capital injections. ", " Global equity markets had risen sharply over the course of the past two months, with the large rises taking many markets back to the levels at the beginning of the year. There was a strong rally in equity prices in Australia, with rises across all market segments. Members noted that better conditions in equity markets had beneficial flow-on effects to other financial markets. ", " The improvement in financial market conditions had been bolstered by generally positive earnings reports from a range of large international financial institutions for the first quarter, despite further significant credit write-downs by the three largest US financial institutions. ", " The Australian banks remained in good financial health, in absolute terms and particularly in comparison with their overseas counterparts. However, provisioning had increased in line with the slowing economy. The aggregate return on equity had fallen over the past year, partly owing to increases in banks' capital ratios. But capital adequacy and profitability remained in strong shape. ", " Turning to government bond yields, the large fiscal stimulus in the United States and United Kingdom in recent months had resulted in a modest increase in yields, but yields were still historically low. Australian government bond yields had shown little net change over the past month, resulting in the spread to US yields narrowing. ", " Conditions in global money markets had improved noticeably, with short-term spreads having fallen back to close to the levels prevailing prior to the Lehman collapse. In Australia, spreads between bank bills and the expected policy rate were near the lowest points seen since the onset of the financial crisis. ", " Members were briefed about developments in the Reserve Bank's balance sheet. The main element was that improved conditions in domestic financial markets had allowed the balance sheet to contract. Exchange settlement balances had been reduced to around $2½ billion; term deposits had been reduced to zero; and there had been a large reduction in demand for US dollars provided under the swap agreement with the US Federal Reserve. ", " Financial institutions had continued to issue government-guaranteed bonds in April, though issuance had slowed from the high levels in previous months. Issuance had been more subdued in Australia. An important development in the past month had been some successful domestic non-guaranteed bond issuance by several Australian banks. The banks had continued to record strong deposit inflows, which they had used to reduce reliance on short-term wholesale funding. ", " In corporate bond markets, issuance in the United States had slowed in April following its high level in the March quarter. Corporate bond spreads had narrowed over the past month, in line with generally improved market sentiment. ", " Activity in the Australian syndicated loan market was subdued in the March quarter. The share of participation by domestic and foreign lenders in refinancing syndicated loan facilities in the quarter was roughly unchanged from the previous few quarters. ", " Members noted that corporate gearing in Australia remained relatively low and debt-servicing burdens were at manageable levels. ", " Looking at monetary policy settings around the world, members noted that market expectations were for the European Central Bank to lower its policy rate later in the week. There was little scope for lower policy rates in most other industrial countries, notably the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. Unconventional measures had been adopted, as foreshadowed, in several countries. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand had lowered its policy rate by 50 basis points to 2.5 per cent. In an attempt to reduce longer-term rates, which are heavily used by borrowers, the central bank had announced that it would keep its policy rate low until the end of 2010. ", " In the major foreign currency markets, members noted that the yen had depreciated early in the month. There had been an appreciation of emerging market currencies and narrowing in spreads, as investors' risk appetite had increased and several countries sought access to the IMF's new lending facility for emerging market countries. ", " Improved sentiment in global markets had led to increased demand for the Australian dollar, which had reached its highest levels since October last year. The net fall over the past year on a trade-weighted basis was about 15 per cent. ", " Members discussed developments in financial intermediaries' lending rates and funding. They noted that, as had been expected, the 25 basis point cash rate reduction at the April meeting had been only partly passed through to housing lending rates, with more pass-through to business indicator rates on this occasion. On the deposits side, competition among banks had remained strong, which meant that interest rates on deposits had fallen less than the cash rate, particularly for term deposits at ‘special rates’. ", " Market prices suggested only a small probability was attached to a cut in the cash rate at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The wide range of economic data considered by the Board generally pointed to some improvement in confidence and economic activity in a number of countries. The strongest signs were in Asia, with production in China rebounding particularly quickly. While it was too early to be confident about the durability of this trend, the evidence was accumulating that the maximum rate of global economic contraction may have passed. ", " Members also noted the much better tone in financial markets. Share prices had risen strongly in all countries in recent weeks and credit spreads were declining noticeably. Businesses had been able to raise more debt in capital markets and banks, including those in Australia, had been able to issue some non-guaranteed debt in their home markets. Sentiment nevertheless remained fragile and could easily be disturbed by adverse news. ", " While members noted that Asian economies were showing signs of a recovery, the best that could be said for the global economy as a whole was that output was beginning to stabilise after the earlier sharp falls. Partial indicators and market developments were consistent with forecasts of an increase in global output in the second half of the year. But given the damage that had been done to the financial sectors in the northern hemisphere, the most likely scenario was that growth would remain below trend for some time, leading to a further build‑up in excess capacity and, therefore, a decline in global inflation. ", " In the case of the Australian economy, members observed that there were signs that the economic stimulus that had been applied was supporting demand. Nonetheless, substantial growth was not expected to resume until around the end of the year. They noted that the coming year would see higher unemployment and falling inflation, though the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate would slow the decline in prices for some time. Overall, the Australian economy was likely to record better outcomes than most other advanced economies in 2009 and 2010, reflecting the healthy state of the domestic banking system and effectiveness of the macroeconomic policy stimulus to date. ", " The question faced by the Board was whether monetary policy should be eased further at this stage, or whether the cash rate should be maintained at its current level pending further information on how economic and financial conditions were unfolding. ", " Taking into account the economic and market developments that had come to light over the past month, the major easing in monetary policy that had already taken place and the substantial fiscal stimulus that was being implemented, members judged that the best course for this meeting was to leave the cash rate unchanged. They would continue to monitor the strength and durability of the tentative signs of an improvement in the global and domestic economies. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.0 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 7 October 2008"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Ric Battellino (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Jillian Broadbent AO, Roger Corbett AO, Graham Kraehe AO, Donald McGauchie AO, Warwick McKibbin ", " David Gruen attended in place of Ken Henry AC (Secretary to the Treasury) in terms of section 22 of the <cite>Reserve Bank Act 1959</cite>. "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Malcolm Edey (Assistant Governor, Economic) ", " David Emanuel (Secretary), Anthony Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board received a comprehensive briefing on financial market developments during the past month, which had been one of the most turbulent periods in recent decades. ", " Financial markets had been characterised by a high degree of pessimism, with the effective failure of several large financial institutions and the nationalisation or take-over of other financial institutions in the United States and Europe. These developments had seen the demise of the US investment banking model and changes to the financial landscape in several countries. There had been a virtual complete closure of wholesale capital markets in the United States and Europe, beyond only the very short term. In Australia, such markets had performed better than their overseas peers, but they were nevertheless severely strained. ", " Public policy responses had culminated in the US Government's plan for the US Treasury to purchase distressed assets from financial institutions in order to facilitate the process of balance sheet repair. There had also been deposit and debt guarantees instituted in some countries. ", " The unfolding crisis had been reflected in high levels of volatility in all financial markets over the past month. Government bond yields had declined as investors sought the safety of sovereign fixed interest securities. Equity markets, in particular, had fallen significantly, with the US S&amp;P 500 down by 25 per cent over the course of the month. Equity markets in emerging economies were also sharply lower. Further declines in commodity prices had led to falls in non-financial shares, whereas, until recently, falls in equity markets had been driven mainly by falls in financial shares. Declining prices of shares in other sectors of the market suggested that investors were starting to price in a significant downturn in the global economy. Share prices in the major markets had fallen back to 2004 levels. ", " The Australian equity market had fallen broadly in line with overseas markets, with the most noticeable falls in the past month in resources shares, reflecting the falls in commodity prices from their recent peaks. Daily volatility of share prices had been very high; 2008 thus far had recorded more days with large price movements than 1987. ", " Members noted that the failure of Lehman Brothers was the catalyst for the current bout of market turmoil and had markedly undermined trust among counterparties. Perceived risk among financial institutions in North America and Europe had risen sharply, as indicated by credit default swap indices. Financial institutions in those markets were willing to deal with one another at only very short horizons. ", " US money market mutual funds had suffered losses as a result of the Lehman default, and subsequent redemptions by investors had made it impossible for the funds to maintain their traditional strong demand for short-term bank paper. This greatly added to banks' funding difficulties. The run on these funds also led to Treasury bill yields falling to zero as investors switched to government debt, and, subsequently, to the provision of a capital value guarantee on money market fund assets by the US Treasury. ", " Global money markets had been dysfunctional. The three-month US dollar LIBOR to swap spread had increased very sharply, though it was not a meaningful indicator given the lack of activity in that market at present. ", " Another market that had suffered dislocation was the foreign exchange swap market. Increased counterparty risk meant that a structural shortage of US dollars was denying investors the capacity to hedge US dollar assets, with the cost of borrowing US dollars outside the United States increasing very sharply. In response to this problem, the Federal Reserve had set up large swap lines with central banks across various time zones in order to distribute US dollars to other markets. Swap lines had been in place with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank and were subsequently extended to several other central banks, including the RBA. The process involved swapping local currencies for US dollars, which were then auctioned to counterparties in each location against domestic collateral. This had been particularly important around the end of the September quarter, when liquidity had been very tightly held. The RBA would shortly be conducting another auction of US dollars, with a term of 95 days in order to span the end of the year. ", " In their efforts to ease these market strains, central banks were acting as intermediaries of last resort, by expanding their domestic liquidity operations and balance sheets accordingly. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet had increased substantially in the past two weeks, part of which included higher gross foreign exchange reserves resulting from the US dollar swap program. ", " Bond spreads had risen over the past month. In the euro area, a sharp rise in other sovereign spreads to German bunds implied that investors had begun to regard even sovereign issues outside the three largest bond markets as risky. Among rising market bond spreads to US government bonds, the most notable was the rise in spreads of low-rated US bonds. ", " Turning to foreign exchange markets, members observed that exchange rates had moved in wide ranges over the past month. In net trade-weighted terms, the US dollar was higher, though it had fallen against the yen as traders unwound positions that had involved selling yen. The US dollar had increased against most currencies over the past year and was about 5 per cent higher in trade-weighted terms. ", " The Australian dollar had been extremely volatile over the past month, trading in a US10 cent range. The exchange rate was 16 per cent lower over the month, measured on a trade-weighted basis, having fallen against the currencies of all of Australia's trading partners, and was now about 20 per cent lower compared with its level a year ago. ", " In reviewing market expectations for policy rates, members noted that official rates in most countries were now expected to fall by the end of the year. The US Fed was expected to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at the next FOMC meeting in late October, with markets attributing some chance of an easing before then. The European Central Bank and other central banks were now also expected to cut policy rates at their next meetings. ", " Members noted that US 30-year mortgage rates had fallen somewhat following the announcement of the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac early in September. However, one-year adjustable rate mortgage rates had remained relatively high. ", " In Australia, a marked shift down in the expected cash rate had led to falls in bank bill rates, but not to the same extent. Bill rates had spiked up around quarter-end, despite there being reasonable turnover in the bill market, and the RBA had injected a large amount of liquidity in its market operations, raising exchange settlement balances to around $11 billion. The RBA had introduced a term deposit facility, partially to absorb the higher exchange settlement balances. The yield on this facility is determined by auction. ", " Members discussed the implications for banks' lending rates of market expectations of official rate cuts this month and later in the year, noting that market expectations were for the cash rate to reach 5½ per cent by mid 2009. They were informed that staff estimates suggested that banks' funding costs had risen by about 20–25 basis points above relevant benchmarks. Banks were still keenly bidding for deposits across the yield curve. ", " One of the consequences of the conditions facing banks was that there was a likelihood of tighter quantitative credit conditions in the period ahead. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The Board's discussion of international economic conditions commenced with a review of the latest data for the United States, which were for August and September and thus predated the latest bout of financial market turmoil. ", " Business conditions in the US manufacturing sector fell sharply in September, in a continuation of the downward trend over the past year. Conditions in non-manufacturing businesses were little changed in September but the trend was down also. Members noted that there was as yet no sign of an end to the housing downturn. The latest data indicated continued falls in housing starts, and house prices had also fallen further over the past few months. While the stock of unsold new houses was falling, it remained well above the average of the past two decades. Consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of spending in the economy, had slowed noticeably since mid year as the effects of the boost to incomes from the package of tax rebates in the June quarter faded. ", " Conditions in the US labour market deteriorated further in September, with a large fall in employment, which had fallen each month this year. The unemployment rate had risen by 1¾ percentage points since its trough early in 2007. ", " Turning to conditions in China, members observed that the growth of industrial production had slowed to around 13 per cent per annum, which was the lowest rate in five years. The slowdown in production of steel, concrete and energy had been much more pronounced. Growth in export volumes from China to the major economies had fallen markedly over the past year. As a result of these developments, the Chinese authorities had eased monetary policy somewhat. ", " There had been a similar pattern of slowing growth in other parts of the world. ", " Revised estimates showed the Japanese economy had contracted by ¾ per cent in the June quarter, and the Tankan survey measure of business conditions had fallen over the past eighteen months to its lowest level in five years. ", " In the rest of east Asia, estimates of growth in aggregate industrial production had fallen from around 10 per cent per annum at the beginning of the year to about 2 per cent at present. ", " The New Zealand economy had experienced a contraction in the first half of the year. ", " In the euro area, GDP fell in the June quarter. Other more recent indicators, such as measures of business and consumer sentiment, were also declining. The United Kingdom was undergoing a significant economic slowdown. GDP had stopped growing, house prices had fallen since the start of the year and housing credit had slowed sharply. ", " Members discussed the implications of the current financial market turmoil for global economic prospects, particularly through the channel of credit provision to businesses and households. Credit was no longer expanding in the United States and had slowed sharply in the euro area and United Kingdom, which were also at the centre of the financial crisis. The slowing in credit had been less pronounced in Canada, which had been affected to a smaller extent by the financial crisis. ", " Members observed that the falls in commodity prices in the past month or so, notably but not only for oil, meant that headline CPI inflation rates in most countries had probably peaked. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Before turning to the most recent data on the domestic economy, members reviewed the national accounts for the June quarter, which were released the day after the previous meeting. GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the quarter, with the slowing broadly in line with the staff's expectation. Members noted that real gross domestic income, which incorporated the effect of the rise in the terms of trade, had increased significantly more than GDP. However, with the terms of trade now appearing to have peaked, this gap was likely to narrow over the period ahead. ", " The staff forecasts for growth, which incorporated the effect of the September rate cut, were little changed from those published in the August <cite>Statement  on Monetary Policy</cite>. More recently released indicators suggested that there had not been any further significant slowing in the economy in the September quarter, though this information predated the onset of the latest bout of financial market turmoil. ", " Members then considered in more detail the information provided by the run of regular monthly data releases, covering household consumption, the housing sector, the business sector, the labour market, commodity prices and wages. ", " There had been some improvement in indicators of consumption in the past few months, but the overall trend had been weak since the end of 2007. Retail sales had increased in July and August, though members noted that the reduction in the sample size for this survey meant that the estimates were now less reliable than they had been previously. The increase in retail sales in August, in particular, was unlikely to have been as large as the seasonally adjusted figure suggested, as the large stores, which were fully enumerated in the survey, had not recorded any increase in sales. Although retail sales in the early part of the September quarter had been stronger than in the June quarter, assisted by lower petrol prices and income tax cuts, liaison conducted by the staff suggested that conditions had deteriorated in September. Members noted that, as with some other economic indicators, NSW was experiencing slower growth in retail sales than other parts of Australia, though the data were volatile and generally less reliable at the state level of disaggregation. ", " Another monthly indicator of consumption was motor vehicle sales, which had fallen and were now more than 10 per cent lower than at the end of 2007. Consumer sentiment had increased modestly in August and September, most likely reflecting the positive effect of lower petrol prices, the tax cuts and the September rate cut, but predating the most recent financial market turmoil. ", " Overall, members thought the slowing in consumer spending that had been recorded over the past year was consistent with the significant slowing in growth of real household disposable income, which, after interest payments, had slowed from about 6 per cent over the year to mid 2007 to 2½ per cent over the year to mid 2008. ", " In the housing sector, housing loan approvals had fallen a little further in July and, according to estimates, in August. The broader measure of household credit was now expanding at a six-month annualised rate of 6 per cent, which had not been seen since the early 1990s. Estimates for house prices in the September quarter suggested that average nationwide prices had fallen a little further, following a fall in the June quarter. On the other hand, auction clearance rates had increased in both Sydney and Melbourne following the rate cut in September. ", " Members observed that there had been a compositional shift in spending in the economy in the first half of the year, characterised by a slowing in consumption while business investment and government spending remained strong. Business investment had increased by 10 per cent over the year to the June quarter, but the outlook was now more uncertain. Despite the positive intentions reported in the capital expenditure survey, private-sector business surveys suggested that investment plans were being scaled back. ", " Business debt funding, which included intermediated and non-intermediated financing, had slowed over the past year, but appeared to have stabilised at growth of around 8 per cent in recent months. ", " Turning to the labour market, members observed that the gradual slowing in trend employment growth had continued over the past month. Statistics suggested that the slowing was most pronounced in NSW compared with elsewhere in Australia, though the employment data by state were quite volatile. Job advertisements had been falling over the past six months, with newspaper job advertisements sharply lower. This suggested further slowing in employment was in prospect. ", " Members discussed the recent falls in spot commodity prices. Oil prices had fallen sharply, with Tapis crude falling over the past month from US$120 per barrel to US$90 per barrel. Movements in the oil price had not been as marked in Australian dollar terms, as the exchange rate had generally appreciated when commodity prices were rising and depreciated when they fell, thereby dampening the effect of the US dollar price movements. Coal prices had also fallen. The premium between the spot thermal coal price and the most recent contract price, which had been close to 40 per cent around mid year, had been eroded; spot prices were now trading at a slight discount to the contract price. There had been similar price movements in the iron ore market. ", " The only data on wages that had become available over the past month had been those from the national accounts, namely average earnings. This series, which was volatile, was growing at about 4 per cent per annum, broadly in line with other wage indicators. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The paper prepared for the Board recommended a large reduction in the cash rate, of at least 50 basis points, with the amount to be subject to review in light of any events occurring between the preparation of the paper and the time of the meeting. In the event, the recommendation put to the Board at the meeting was for a reduction of 100 basis points, to 6.0 per cent. ", " The key factors for members' consideration were the sharply worsening conditions in international financial markets during September and the consequential deterioration in the global economic outlook. Prices in global asset markets had fallen sharply and growth in credit in the major economies had slowed to unusually low rates. These developments meant that households and businesses in many countries would have difficulty accessing funding and that global economic activity, which had already slowed significantly, would probably slow further. Members noted that forecasts of growth in GDP in both developed and developing economies were, therefore, in the process of being revised down, particularly for 2009. Members also noted that Australian financial markets were being affected to a lesser extent than in many other countries, given the relative strength of the domestic banking system. Nonetheless, the deterioration in the outlook for global economic activity posed downside risks to the domestic economy. ", " Members observed that, domestically, the path of economic activity had to date evolved in line with the Board's previous expectations, with the needed moderation in demand occurring. However, the latest economic data predated the onset of the current bout of financial market turmoil. The June quarter national accounts had presented a picture of weak consumption and strong investment, with the aggregate growth of demand slowing. While investment spending had been strong over the year to the June quarter, and stated expectations by firms in July and August had been for further strength in the year ahead, it was becoming more likely that these intentions would be scaled back. Members noted that the expansionary effects of the recent surge in Australia's terms of trade were still being felt. With the world economy clearly slowing, however, and many commodity prices now having fallen significantly from their peaks, the external stimulus to Australian incomes and demand was expected to fade over the year ahead. ", " Although the September quarter CPI, to be released before the next meeting, was likely to show an increase of around 5 per cent over the year, members noted that the current staff forecast was for inflation to start to decline in 2009. Moreover, the recent deterioration in global growth prospects, together with the more difficult market conditions even for creditworthy borrowers, increased the risk that demand and output could be significantly weaker than earlier expected. In that scenario, inflation would most likely fall faster than expected previously. ", " In view of the latest economic and financial market developments, members judged that the material change to the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for growth and inflation in Australia meant that a significantly less restrictive stance of monetary policy was now appropriate. It was acknowledged that the current level of interest rates meant that monetary policy had significant capacity to provide stimulus. ", " In assessing the recommendation, members observed that an easing of 100 basis points would bring forward some of the easing markets had already priced in for following months. The increased downside risks to growth and the improved prospects for lower inflation meant that there was a strong economic case to do so. As staff estimates suggested that banks' funding costs had risen by about 20–25 basis points relative to relevant benchmarks, any reduction in interest rates that banks announced on loans to customers would most likely be less than the change in the cash rate by a similar margin. ", " The Board considered the possibility that a larger-than-expected easing of 100 basis points could have a negative effect on market sentiment. The exchange rate in particular had fallen sharply over the preceding 24 hours. Members concluded that, despite the possibility of a short-term adverse reaction, stronger action would help sentiment over time. ", " Taking careful note of all those considerations, the Board decided that, on this occasion, a reduction in the cash rate of 100 basis points was appropriate. Members did not regard this unusually large adjustment as establishing a pattern for future monetary policy decisions. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 100 basis points to 6.0 per cent, effective 8 October. "]}},

", " US GDP had recorded a small fall in the September quarter, with the national accounts indicating weak consumption, a continuing drag on growth from housing activity and flat business investment. Only government spending and exports had supported overall expenditure. ", " Monthly indicators of US household consumption showed that consumption was falling in year-ended terms, after having fallen in the past few months. Spending on motor vehicles and durables was very weak, while spending on services had continued to grow, but at a slower pace. The boost to disposable income from the package of tax rebates in the June quarter was reversed in the September quarter. ", " Housing construction in the United States remained very weak. Monthly housing starts were below 1 million in annualised terms, which was around the trough of the previous major downturn in housing in the early 1990s. Given the low level of starts, the overhang of the stock of unsold new houses was now being wound back quite quickly. The playing out of these cyclical dynamics was expected in time to lead to a pick-up in activity. Nonetheless, for the present, house prices were still falling. ", " Members noted that economic conditions in other countries were also softening. ", " In the developed countries, Japan had recorded falling industrial production since the beginning of the year. Europe was also experiencing a significant slowing in output. Industrial production in the euro area was falling over the past six months. In the United Kingdom, GDP fell by ½ per cent in the September quarter, following no growth in the June quarter. The housing sector was weak. ", " For the G7 countries in aggregate, 2009 was expected to be the weakest year since 1982. The latest IMF forecasts for year-average growth in 2009, published in October, had been revised down to 0.2 per cent from over 1 per cent forecast in July. This implied that a period of falling GDP in quarterly terms was expected. ", " In China, growth of 9 per cent over the past year was down from more than 12 per cent recorded a year earlier. This was still a rapid rate of growth, and an important contributor to global growth given China's rising share of the world economy. Growth of industrial production was now well below the rates that had been typical over the past five years; although these data may incorporate some Olympics-related declines in production, considerably weaker data on steel production over a longer period suggested that the slowing in activity was probably more widespread. ", " Reflecting an oversupply of steel, Asian steel prices in US dollar terms peaked in July and were now down by around 20 per cent. ", " Members noted that industrial production in the smaller Asian economies had slowed sharply over recent months and was falling when measured in six-month-ended annualised terms. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members considered in detail the information provided by the run of regular monthly data releases, covering the household, housing and business sectors, the labour market, commodity prices and the external sector, and prices and wages. ", " Indicators of consumption had generally been weaker over the past month. Retail sales fell by over 1 per cent in September. Weakness in retail sales over the past year was concentrated in the smaller retailers, but these data were less reliable than previously, owing to reduced sampling. Larger retailers recorded a small increase in retail sales in September, but liaison by the staff suggested that conditions in October had weakened. Another indicator of consumption was motor vehicle sales, which had fallen significantly in the September quarter. Consumer sentiment had been volatile but remained at a low level in October. ", " Turning to the housing sector, nationwide house prices fell by 1.8 per cent in the September quarter, according to ABS figures. The falls had been widespread, though a notable feature had been recent weakness at the top end of the market. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had recovered somewhat during September and early October, following the interest rate cuts, but had since fallen again. They were well below average levels in both cities. ", " Data on housing finance suggested that loan approvals and housing credit growth had stopped falling in the past few months. Taking a longer-run perspective, however, members observed that both housing and personal credit growth were at low levels. ", " The recent falls in house prices and on equity markets had led to a decline in household net worth of about 8 per cent since the start of the year. The falls in equity prices thus far in the December quarter meant the fall was now larger. Members noted that there were few precedents for the current developments in household wealth. ", " Members then turned to a discussion of conditions in the business sector. They noted that indicators from the NAB survey had softened further in the September quarter. There were now also some signs of business expansion plans being scaled back and forward orders falling. Nonetheless, growth of business borrowing from all sources had not slowed further recently, and appeared to have levelled out at around 7–8 per cent per annum. ", " In reviewing conditions in the labour market, members noted that there had been a small rise in employment in September, but the data were volatile and the trend suggested employment growth was slowing from a peak of around 3 per cent late in 2007 to just over 1 per cent at present. Looking forward, job advertisements and information from business surveys were both suggesting that the demand for labour was slowing. ", " Members discussed the effect of the falls in commodity prices on Australia's external position. Bulk commodity prices had fallen sharply in the past few months. Iron ore and thermal coal prices had fallen by around 60 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, since their peaks; spot prices were now well below the most recent contract prices for those commodities. Base metals prices had fallen significantly from their recent peak earlier in the year and were around levels of three years ago. Rural commodity prices had also fallen noticeably over the past year. Oil prices had fallen sharply, with the Tapis crude oil price now around US$60 per barrel. As had been observed previously, the decline in the oil price had not been as marked in Australian dollar terms, as the exchange rate had depreciated significantly over the past few months. ", " Despite the recent falls in commodity prices, the price rises earlier in the year for bulk commodity contract prices had led to a significant narrowing of the current account deficit from its peak of 7 per cent earlier in the year. However, the terms of trade were expected to fall noticeably over the forecast period as bulk commodity prices were adjusted down again. ", " Members were then briefed on the September quarter CPI and the outlook for growth and inflation. ", " The CPI increased by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter and by 5 per cent in year-ended terms. Underlying inflation was slightly above 4½ per cent, with the quarterly rate levelling out at a little over 1 per cent. These outcomes were broadly in line with expectations. ", " Members observed that an internationally comparable definition of core inflation excluding food, energy and financial services showed a less pronounced pick-up than the headline CPI suggested, but was nonetheless now around 3½ per cent per annum. In contrast, this measure of core inflation in other developed countries had been broadly flat at 2 per cent per annum for several years. ", " Data on wage increases associated with enterprise bargaining agreements indicated that wages growth was stable at around 4 per cent. ", " Members were informed that the staff forecasts were for output growth to be well below trend. GDP growth would receive a boost in the December and March quarters from the recently announced fiscal stimulus package, but the underlying trend in growth was lower than expected three months earlier. This would act to put greater downward pressure on inflation, though the recent exchange rate depreciation would have a countervailing influence. In the short term, CPI inflation would be reduced by recent falls in petrol prices; if current petrol prices were sustained, they would produce a noticeable fall in headline inflation in the December quarter. This could assist in containing inflation expectations. The staff's revised forecasts would be published in the forthcoming <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. "], "Financial Markets": [" Financial market conditions were generally worse in October than in September. ", " Despite the policy actions taken by governments in many countries to recapitalise banks and to guarantee their deposits and debt obligations, money markets had seized up further. A positive sign, however, was that in the past week there had been some narrowing in spreads and some lengthening in debt issuance in the United States. Spreads in the United Kingdom and euro area were still high. The money market in Australia had continued generally to fare better than those overseas. ", " During the month, the Federal Reserve introduced a number of new facilities to provide liquidity and extended some existing facilities. US dollar swap arrangements were extended to additional central banks and some existing swap lines were increased to provide unlimited amounts of US dollars at a fixed price. These actions appeared to be working in reducing liquidity strains in the market, with the cost of US dollar funding outside the United States declining. The Fed's balance sheet had increased substantially and was now more than double its size a year ago. ", " Turning to the significant monetary policy responses to the slowdown over the past month, members noted the co-ordinated rate cuts by a number of developed country central banks early in October and further reductions later in the month, including by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and the Riksbank. In addition, the Bank of Japan eased policy by 20 basis points and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its policy rate by 100 basis points. Market participants expected there would be further sizeable monetary policy easing, including by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England later in the week. The market was still pricing in more rate cuts by those central banks in coming months. ", " Monetary policy had also been eased in several developing economies. The People's Bank of China had reduced rates twice, following a period of tightening monetary policy over the previous four years, and the Reserve Bank of India had cut its policy rate by 150 basis points. The Bank of Korea had cut its rate by 100 basis points at an emergency policy meeting and, in an unusual move given its currency peg to the US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority had initiated an additional cut to that of the Federal Reserve. However, interest rates were being increased in some countries in response to sharp currency depreciations. ", " Global share markets had been extremely volatile during October and had fallen sharply. Some of the fall had been reversed late in the month. Movements in the month took markets back to levels of 2003, and in Japan, to levels of the early 1980s. Share markets in emerging economies had been particularly weak over the past month. ", " The Australian equity market, while also volatile, had fallen less than other developed markets. Within the Australian market, financial stocks fell by less than resources stocks. The market overall was back at late 2004 levels. Price/earnings ratios were now at low levels relative to the past few decades, but analysts' expectations of earnings would most likely be revised down somewhat in the period ahead. ", " Members noted that the decline in the Australian equity market had led to a large increase in the number of calls on margin loans, and that outstanding debt from margin lending had fallen by almost a third since the end of 2007. ", " Turning to foreign exchange markets, members observed that exchange rates had also experienced extreme volatility over the past month, including the major currency pairs. There had been a significant appreciation of the yen as carry trades were unwound and Japanese investors repatriated investment funds. The US dollar had appreciated against currencies other than the yen. Over the past year, it had appreciated against most currencies and by over 10 per cent in trade-weighted terms. ", " Asian currencies had generally depreciated over the past month. The Korean won had fallen owing to the repatriation of funds from the Korean equity market and concerns about the exposure of Korean banks to debt denominated in US dollars. ", " The Australian dollar had traded in a very wide range in October, depreciating in trade-weighted terms by about 12 per cent. Movements in the exchange rate had been driven by the deterioration in the global economic outlook, falls in commodity prices and the general unwinding of leveraged investment positions. Members were briefed that the Australian dollar appeared to have been used as a proxy for less liquid investments, including emerging market currencies. Volatility in the exchange rate reached unprecedented levels in October. On a number of occasions, when conditions in the foreign exchange market had become particularly thin, the Bank had purchased Australian dollars to provide liquidity. Members were informed that these instances of intervention were not designed to defend any particular level of the exchange rate. The exchange rate had depreciated by more than 20 per cent over the past year and was now about 5 per cent below its post-float average. ", " In looking at government bond markets in developed countries, members noted that they had been relatively less volatile over the past month. US bond yields had been around 4 per cent. However, there were signs of the financial dislocation. In the euro area, increased risk aversion among investors had seen spreads on non-German government debt widen to levels that predated European Monetary Union. ", " Emerging market sovereign spreads had also widened noticeably over the past month. ", " Turning to the Australian money market, members noted that market yields had moved sharply lower following the announcement of the reduction in the cash rate of 100 basis points in October. Since then, yields had fallen further as expectations of further rate cuts were priced in. ", " The Bank had announced changes to its dealing arrangements in early October to allow regular lending for longer terms than previously. As a result, the average maturity of the Bank's repo book had increased from around 50 to 100 days. The collateral that the Bank would accept in its dealing operations was also widened. The size of the Bank's balance sheet had expanded; on the assets side this was mainly the result of the larger repo book and the US dollar swap arrangement with the Fed. ", " Members discussed the latest bank earnings results, noting that they had been solid in the current circumstances. Lower official interest rates had been fully passed on to housing loan rates, but significantly less so to business lending rates, in particular small business rates. ", " Members noted that market expectations were for the cash rate to reach 4–4¼ per cent in the first half of 2009. Market pricing indicated that, for the current meeting, a fall of 50 basis points had been fully priced in, with a significant probability of a 75 basis point move. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The paper prepared for the Board recommended a further easing of monetary policy, suggesting a reduction in the cash rate of 50 basis points, with the amount to be subject to review in light of any further information becoming available between the preparation of the paper and the time of the meeting. At the meeting, the Governor proposed that members consider the choice between a reduction of 50 basis points and one of 75 basis points. ", " Key factors in members' consideration of the policy decision were the continuing poor conditions in financial markets, the significant deterioration in the outlook for the world economy, with implications for Australia, and the likelihood that inflation in Australia would fall over the year ahead. ", " World financial markets had remained turbulent over the past month. Global equity prices had been volatile and had fallen further in net terms. There had also been very sharp exchange rate movements, including a large depreciation of the Australian dollar. The availability of credit in global markets had continued to be tight, though members noted that the measures announced by governments to strengthen their financial systems should help to stabilise conditions over time. ", " Data on the world economy indicated a further deterioration in economic conditions in the major industrial economies, and there had been further signs that China and other parts of the developing world were now slowing. In Australia, until recently, the overall path of economic activity had been roughly in line with the Board's earlier expectations. However, the marked deterioration in global financial conditions over the past couple of months, which had also had an effect on Australian financial markets and share prices, was likely to have a significant effect as well on business and consumer sentiment, and liaison information was reflecting this. This would probably lead to a significant curtailment of planned investment spending and caution on the part of households. ", " Members judged that the recent reductions in interest rates on loans following earlier policy action, the depreciation of the exchange rate and the fiscal stimulus announced in October would cushion, but probably not fully offset, the negative forces on the domestic economy arising from deteriorating international conditions, lower commodity prices and lower household wealth. As such, members thought that domestic spending and activity would be weaker than earlier expected. They noted that over the past month the staff forecast for growth had been lowered and that, despite this, the most recent information suggested that the risks to the outlook remained to the downside. ", " Members noted that consumer price inflation in Australia was again high in the September quarter, as had been expected. However, with domestic capacity pressures now easing and the outlook for much softer growth in demand and activity than had been seen until recently, members could reasonably expect that inflation in Australia would soon start to fall. Global disinflationary forces from the slowdown in the world economy and lower commodity prices would assist in this regard. The depreciation of the exchange rate, however, meant that the decline of inflation to the target could take longer than previously thought. While this could pose risks to inflationary expectations, these were regarded as manageable in the context of a generally disinflationary environment over the next couple of years. ", " Members agreed that a further sizeable reduction in official interest rates was appropriate. This would enable a further meaningful reduction in rates paid by borrowers and could assist confidence among consumers and businesses. In addition, given the changing balance of risks, there was an advantage in moving the setting of monetary policy quickly to a neutral position. ", " On balance, members judged that a reduction in the cash rate of 75 basis points was appropriate on this occasion. Members were conscious of the high rate of inflation at present and of the need to bring it down over time, but felt that in the current environment a reduction of this size would not undermine that task. As such, they judged that the policy action would strike the right balance between the need to return inflation to the target and the need to reduce the risk of an unduly sharp weakening of demand. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 75 basis points to 5.25 per cent, effective 5 November. "]}},

GDP data for the December quarter in the major economies had now been released, showing a fall of 1.8 per cent for the G7 as a whole, the biggest quarterly fall since these data were first available in the early 1960s. Looking across the individual countries for which GDP data for the December quarter were available, the bulk of countries had recorded falls in output greater than 1 per cent. A small number of economies in east Asia had recorded very large falls in quarterly output, similar to those seen during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. ", " In the United States, revised figures showed that GDP in the December quarter fell by more than indicated in the advance estimate. Quarterly output was 1.6 per cent lower, resulting in a decline over the year of almost 1 per cent. Members noted that the effect of the various financial assistance packages that had been announced in recent months had been very significant in budgetary terms, with US official forecasts for the deficit to rise to over 12 per cent of GDP in 2010, the highest in the post-War period. More recent economic data showed further deterioration in the labour market and ongoing weakness in the housing sector, with house prices continuing to fall on some measures. ", " In the December quarter, Japan recorded its largest fall in quarterly GDP in over three decades. The year-ended decline in output of almost 5 per cent was the largest in the post-War period. Indicators of activity for the March quarter were also weak, with industrial production falling by 10 per cent in January, to be 30 per cent below its peak in mid 2008. This suggested another large fall in GDP in the March quarter was likely. Members noted that the level of industrial production had fallen back to that of 25 years ago. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, apart from the Philippines and Indonesia, GDP had fallen in the December quarter, as foreshadowed by the monthly data on industrial production. ", " The Indian economy was now also slowing significantly, following a period of rapid growth. The slowing had reflected the effects of international trade linkages and a broader moderation in the domestic economy, with industrial production weakening. ", " In China, there had recently been some positive signs in the monthly manufacturing indicators, but it was too early to assess their significance. ", " The economy of the euro area was also weak in the December quarter, with a fall in GDP of 1.5 per cent. The economic sentiment indicator, which tracks output growth relatively well, had fallen further in February. ", " Turning to commodity markets, members noted that there had been some stabilisation in a number of key commodity prices since late last year, notably oil prices and, to a lesser extent, base metals prices. Spot prices for bulk commodities had also stabilised somewhat in the past few months, but had fallen again more recently. ", " Movements in commodity prices largely determined Australia's terms of trade, which peaked in the September quarter following a large run-up over the preceding decade. Although the terms of trade were now falling sharply, and therefore subtracting from growth in Australian national income, the expected level over the next year or so was still relatively high. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members were informed that, with the national accounts for the December quarter scheduled for release the day after the meeting, the partial data available to date indicated a small fall in output in the quarter. This was similar to the expectation held a few months earlier. Recent indicators suggested that economic activity had remained subdued in the early part of the March quarter. ", " Members then considered in detail the information provided by the regular data releases. ", " In the business sector, the NAB survey indicated that after the sharp fall late last year, confidence had remained at very low levels in recent months. Business conditions, while also having fallen, were fluctuating around levels similar to those seen during the slowdown early in the current decade. Slowing business activity had led to further declines in capacity utilisation, which had fallen noticeably from the peak levels reached a year or so earlier. ", " Turning to the household sector, retail spending had increased sharply in December, after a run of weak readings in previous months. This produced a rise in spending in inflation-adjusted terms in the December quarter, following three quarters in which sales had been relatively flat. Data released during the meeting showed that the higher level of December sales was maintained in January, with sales rising by a further 0.2 per cent. ", " Members noted that real household disposable income had been boosted towards the end of 2008 by lower lending interest rates, lower petrol prices and government transfer payments. Members recognised that these effects were not evenly spread across households and that for households which are interest receivers there had been a loss of income from that source. But for the household sector as a whole, the net effect had been a significant addition to disposable income. Liaison conducted by the staff indicated weakness in retail conditions in February. Consumer sentiment had fluctuated around the low level reached in the latter part of 2008, though conditions for purchasing major household items were perceived to have improved in the past few months. ", " In the housing sector, building approvals fell sharply in the second half of 2008, which implied that residential construction activity would fall during the early part of this year. Declines in house prices in the past few months had mainly been in the more expensive suburbs, with prices in other suburbs appearing to level out. In a sign of increased demand for housing, patterns of housing finance indicated an increase in housing loan approvals of about 10 per cent over the past few months, partly spurred by the increased incentives for first home buyers to enter the market. However, credit growth had remained low as borrowers had evidently taken advantage of the extra cash flows created by lower lending interest rates to increase debt repayments. Further signs of an increased level of activity in the secondary housing market were significant rises in auction clearance rates in both Sydney and Melbourne in February, and a component of the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment survey indicated that current conditions were conducive to buying a dwelling. ", " Members were informed that business investment was still growing during the latter months of 2008, and had now recorded seven years of double-digit growth on average. However, it was clear that investment spending plans for the year ahead were now being scaled back. For instance, non-residential building approvals had fallen by more than half over the past year or so, and this weakness would flow into construction activity over the period ahead. Commercial loan approvals had declined through 2008. Usage of credit facilities had declined less than credit limits, suggesting some tightening in credit conditions. Nonetheless, a survey of small and medium businesses indicated that finance was of less concern than other issues such as lack of demand and concerns about the general economic climate. ", " Looking at government finances, the Australian Government's fiscal package announced in February would provide significant stimulus to the economy over the next two years. The easing in the consolidated state fiscal position was expected to be smaller than for the Commonwealth. The state governments were in relatively good financial health and the net debt of the state public sector in aggregate was low, measured in relation to state economic output. ", " Conditions in the labour market had continued to soften, with no growth in monthly trend employment in January. The unemployment rate to date had risen relatively gradually from its low of 4 per cent, though members noted that significant deterioration was forecast. They observed that several other countries had also had quite modest rises in unemployment thus far, with the sharpest rises in the United States and United Kingdom, which had both been at the centre of the financial turmoil over the past year. ", " The main news in relation to inflation over the past month was the release of the wage price index for the December quarter, which indicated an increase of 1.2 per cent in the quarter and 4.3 per cent over the year. The slightly stronger rise in the quarter mainly reflected a bunching of some major public-sector agreements; the private-sector component rose more slowly and around the same rates recorded in previous quarters. The Bank's liaison information and recent business surveys suggested that growth in labour costs would moderate in 2009. ", " Although consumers' inflation expectations were not particularly well measured in Australia, they had declined over the past six months or so, following a rise over the preceding year, and now lay within the target band. ", " Members were briefed that the inflation forecasts remained unchanged from those published in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, namely for inflation in underlying terms to decline to around 2 per cent by mid 2011. They would be reviewed following receipt of the national accounts data for the December quarter. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that sentiment in global financial markets had deteriorated again in February after having stabilised somewhat over the preceding two months. The deterioration had been prompted by the combination of weak economic data in many countries and concerns about how countries, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, would resolve their financial difficulties. As a consequence, major equity markets had fallen back to or below the low points reached last November, with financial stocks particularly weak. Equity markets in emerging market economies had not been as weak. Notwithstanding the general deterioration in financial market sentiment, conditions in global money markets were considerably better than late last year. ", " Policy interest rates in a number of countries had been reduced further towards zero. Several central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, were expected to cut rates by around 50 basis points later in the week. In countries where policy rates were at or near zero, policies of ‘credit easing’ had been implemented. The Fed had introduced a long-term repo facility and was buying agency paper, though mortgage rates had not declined any further in the past month or so. The Bank of Japan was buying commercial paper and shares. The Bank of England had begun buying commercial debt. ", " There had also been a substantial easing in monetary policy over the past month in emerging market economies. ", " Government bond yields in the major markets had risen over the past month. In Australia, bond yields had generally moved in line with global developments, and initial auctions of Commonwealth Government securities (CGS) had been oversubscribed several times. ", " Members were briefed on financial market developments in Eastern Europe and their implications. Credit growth in most countries in this region had been high over the past few years and the domestic banking sectors were largely foreign owned. Members noted that while some Western European banks had relatively high exposures, lending to emerging Europe, as a share of their total lending, was not particularly large. Eastern European currencies had depreciated significantly recently and the economies were slowing rapidly. This had exacerbated the difficulties faced by borrowers in meeting their foreign currency loan repayment obligations. Despite these developments, emerging market spreads overall had not risen significantly over the past month. ", " Sovereign spreads of some smaller euro area countries had risen in response to concerns over exposures to Eastern Europe as well as rating downgrades. ", " In Australia, the market for semi-government securities had been disrupted by the recent rating downgrade of Queensland. As a result, spreads to CGS had widened by over 25 basis points, more so for Queensland. Semis were now trading at the same spread as government-guaranteed bank paper and supras that carried AAA-government guarantees. Members noted that actual yields nonetheless remained low by historical standards. ", " Bond issuance by highly rated corporates had been quite significant in recent weeks, primarily in the United States. Issuance of government-guaranteed debt by banks in the United States and Australia had continued to be very strong. After falling initially, spreads on this type of debt, relative to government bonds, had stabilised in both markets. ", " The Australian banks had raised further large amounts of guaranteed debt in February, including two large raisings in yen in the Japanese market. Nearly all of the issuance had been guaranteed, with there being negligible investor interest in non-guaranteed bank debt. The issuance meant the banks were well ahead on their funding programs for 2009. There had also been an increase in the average maturity of their outstanding debt. ", " Turning to foreign currency markets, members noted that the major exchange rates had been more stable over the past month, apart from the yen, which had depreciated noticeably. The US dollar was now around 20 per cent above its trough early in 2008. During most of the past month, the Australian dollar had shown little net change, but had fluctuated in a relatively large range; it had fallen in the days preceding the meeting. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar had depreciated by more than 20 per cent over the past year, with a significant fall against the yen, though some of the fall against the yen had been reversed in recent weeks. ", " The domestic share market had declined by about 8 per cent over the past month and, overall, was back below the trough in November 2008. Resources stocks had fallen more modestly over the month. ", " The December half-year corporate profit reporting season had revealed that headline profits were significantly lower owing to higher provisioning and write-downs, but underlying profits had been relatively stable. In terms of market capitalisation, the bulk of companies reporting had recorded reasonable increases in underlying profits. Non-financial companies had been issuing a large amount of equity in the past few months, to replace debt that had been difficult to roll over. ", " Members were briefed on the pass-through of the monetary policy change in February to lending rates in Australia. The reduction in the cash rate in February had been passed on in full to housing and small business loan rates, but there had been less pass-through to other business rates, as risk margins were widening. Members noted that housing lending rates were now at multi-decade lows and business lending rates were well below average. ", " Market expectations for the outcome of this meeting were mixed; pricing indicated a 50 per cent chance of a 50 basis points cut in the cash rate. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted the rapid deterioration in the world economy in the December quarter and the likelihood that many countries would experience further sizeable falls in output in the current quarter. Although there had been an improvement in conditions in global credit markets over recent months, a lack of clarity about how overseas authorities would resolve problems in their financial sectors had significantly weakened equity markets, particularly for financial stocks. These ongoing strains had continued to affect adversely the confidence of businesses and consumers across the world. Although significant macroeconomic policy stimulus had been put in place in many countries, it was too soon to see the effects of those measures; in some cases fiscal stimulus had been announced but not yet implemented. The near-term outlook for the global economy therefore remained very weak and official forecasts of world economic growth in 2009 were likely to be revised down further. ", " Members noted that the domestic financial system remained strong and the monetary policy transmission process was working to deliver large reductions in interest rates to end borrowers, particularly households. Early indications were that credit demand by households was responding to these changes. Nonetheless, while the Australian economy had so far remained stronger than many other economies, the speed and scale of the global economic deterioration and its effect on confidence meant that in the near term domestic activity would unavoidably be weak, and indicators for the most recent period would show that weakness as they were released. The latest available information suggested that the national accounts to be released the following day would probably show a small fall in GDP in the December quarter, a weaker outcome than had appeared likely a few days earlier, though not significantly different from forecasts made for the previous meeting. ", " Members further noted that the easing implemented over recent months was large by historical standards. These measures, together with very substantial fiscal policy measures, had been taken before official data were available to gauge the extent of economic weakness. Early indications were that the monetary and fiscal stimulus that had been applied to the economy was having an expansionary effect, but the size of this remained unclear and it would take some time for the full impact to come through. ", " The question for policy was whether further stimulus should be added at this meeting, or whether, having reduced rates at each meeting since September, the Board should pause for a further evaluation of the situation. Members could see reasonable cases for both courses of action. On balance, they judged that, having made a major change to monetary policy over the preceding several meetings in anticipation of weak economic conditions, the best course for this meeting was to leave the cash rate unchanged. Members believed this would leave adequate flexibility for policy at future meetings. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.25 per cent. "]}},

For the world as a whole, GDP outcomes were not likely to be as weak over coming quarters as they were in the December 2008 and March 2009 quarters. ", " Members observed that in many countries there had recently been large declines in inventories, as businesses responded to reduced demand and the general increase in economic uncertainty. This decline in inventories meant that, in many instances, the fall in output had been larger than the fall in final demand. However, with the inventory cycle now well advanced, it was likely that the divergence between demand and output would narrow. ", " In discussing broad trends in industrial production around the world, members took particular note of the strong recovery in Chinese industrial production and the pick-up in production in a number of east Asian economies, including Japan. The story was not as positive in the western advanced economies, where industrial production was still falling in the United States and the euro area, albeit at a slower rate in the former. ", " Recent data provided further signs that growth had picked up in China. Members noted the very large increases in fixed capital investment by the public sector and the strong credit growth. They also noted that the value of exports had shown few signs of recovery after falling by around 25 per cent over the past year. While some uncertainty about the durability of China's economic recovery inevitably remained, there were reasonable grounds to expect that the Chinese economy would continue to record solid growth outcomes. ", " Members noted that the rate of decline in output in the advanced economies was slowing. Although recent data for the United States had been mixed, there were some signs that the rate of deterioration in the labour market had slowed, with the rate of decline in non-farm payrolls falling and some stabilisation in jobless claims in April. However, retail sales and consumption continued to be weak, with the current value of retail sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, about 4 per cent below that recorded around the middle of 2008. ", " Conditions in the Japanese economy had been very weak. GDP fell by 4 per cent in the March quarter, a little more than the fall in the December quarter. Prices were falling again and nominal GDP was back to the levels of the early 1990s. More positively, there had been a strong bounce-back in the manufacturing PMI, an indicator of business sentiment. There had also been a pick-up in export volumes, after the very large falls late in 2008 and early in 2009 that reflected the collapse in global demand for high-end capital and consumer goods. ", " The euro area economy remained in recession. In most countries, GDP in the March quarter had fallen by more than in the December quarter, with Germany in particular recording a large fall. Although measures of consumer and business sentiment in the euro area had improved somewhat, signs of recovery had been more difficult to detect than in the United States or Japan. ", " Members noted that recent outcomes in a number of east Asian economies were better than those recorded late last year. In particular, east Asia had recorded significantly better GDP outcomes in the March quarter than in the December quarter, though output had still fallen. Recent data suggested there had been some pick-up in both exports and industrial production in a wide range of economies in the region. ", " Members discussed developments in government balance sheets in the major economies, noting the current large fiscal deficits and prospective increases in government debt levels. For the advanced economies as a whole, budget deficits had increased more quickly, and by a larger amount, than in previous downturns, reflecting the synchronised nature of the current downturn and the significant discretionary easing of fiscal policy. Containing the build-up of public debt over the years ahead was likely to be a significant challenge for some countries, particularly given the ageing of the population and relatively slow growth in nominal income. ", " Members concluded their discussion of the world economy by observing that, despite the slightly more positive data for the world economy as a whole, a considerable degree of uncertainty regarding prospects for recovery remained. Growth was likely to be below trend for some time, and spare capacity and unemployment were expected to rise. Members also noted that the process of balance sheet adjustment by both households and businesses at present was weighing on many economies. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The staff informed members that the available data, including those released during the meeting, suggested a strong increase in the expenditure measure of GDP in the March quarter but a significant decline in the production measure. The difference between the measures appeared to be unusually large. Members noted that there had been a very strong contribution to growth from net exports. ", " Since the previous meeting, retail sales data had been released for both March and April. These data showed that the level of spending was about 5 per cent higher than in November last year, with the recent fiscal stimulus packages a factor in this growth. Liaison conducted by the staff indicated that retail conditions had been strong in May, partly reflecting the tax bonus payments in the second half of April and early May. Some retailers, however, held concerns about conditions in June and beyond. Members noted that lower interest rates had also been important in improving aggregate household cash flow. Motor vehicle sales to the household sector had fallen since the boost in December from year-end clearances. ", " Conditions in the housing sector were improving. Building approvals had continued to increase, with the current trend confirmed by figures for April released during the meeting. Data on first-home buyer grants also showed a rise in the number of first-home buyers purchasing newly constructed homes. In addition, housing loan approvals had picked up recently for both repeat buyers and first-time buyers. In the secondary housing market, dwelling prices showed a modest rise in April, following gains in the previous few months. ", " In common with many other advanced economies, business investment in the March quarter recorded a large decline, with falls in spending on both equipment and buildings &amp; structures. In addition, business expectations about future investment spending were downgraded. However, in contrast to many other economies, investment as a share of GDP was not expected to fall to unusually low levels, in large part because of continuing high levels of investment in the mining sector. ", " Business credit had fallen in the past few months, though other sources of funding had been stronger, with significant equity raisings by large businesses. Many businesses were facing higher risk margins when loan facilities were rolled over or renegotiated, and many had experienced a significant tightening in the terms under which credit was available. ", " Members were briefed on key aspects of the recently announced Australian Government budget, noting both the significant increase in government spending and projected decline in revenues as a share of GDP. Members also noted that the fiscal expansion, together with the monetary policy easing over recent months, represented the largest macroeconomic policy stimulus over recent decades. ", " Turning to the external sector, exports in the March quarter had been remarkably strong, especially in light of the large decline in global trade that had taken place since late last year. Rural exports, notably wheat, had risen strongly, and there had been a smaller fall in manufacturing exports than that experienced in some other countries. Services exports had held up, as had resources exports despite the large fall in world industrial production. ", " Members noted the importance of China as a destination for Australia's exports, with China's share of merchandise exports rising from 5 per cent at the end of the 1990s to over 20 per cent now. Recently, Australian exports of iron ore and coking coal had benefited from increased demand from China at a time when other sources of demand had declined. ", " Members noted that while measured employment had increased unexpectedly in April, forward indicators and information from business liaison continued to suggest further deterioration in the labour market over the months ahead. In addition, the recent data on wages suggested that softer labour market conditions were starting to have an effect on private-sector wage outcomes. In contrast, signs of moderation in public-sector wage growth were not yet apparent in the published data, though pressure on state budgets was likely to be a constraining factor over the period ahead. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members were informed that the general improvement in conditions in credit markets had continued. A significant rise in government bond yields was consistent with that improvement, but also suggested that concerns were rising about the global supply of sovereign debt. ", " Global credit spreads had fallen further during the month and were now at levels prevailing prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September last year. Domestic money market spreads had declined to around the lowest points since the onset of the financial crisis. ", " The release of the stress test results for the 19 largest banks in the United States, and banks' subsequent actions in raising funds, had on balance received a positive reaction in financial markets. The results indicated that around US$75 billion extra capital needed to be raised, but over half of the banks did not require more capital to withstand the stress scenario. Immediately following the results, a number of banks, including those that were not required to do so, undertook capital raisings, which were generally oversubscribed. Bank CDS spreads, particularly for US banks, declined sharply in the period after the announcement of the stress test results. ", " In addition to the US banks' capital raisings, there had also been sizeable non-guaranteed bank debt issuance at longer maturities, but spreads had varied quite widely. An ability to raise non-guaranteed debt was a precondition for the repayment of TARP funds, which a number of financial institutions were seeking to do as soon as they were allowed. Overall, bond spreads on issues by US financial institutions had narrowed over the past month, including on government-guaranteed debt. ", " Global government-guaranteed bond issuance by banks had slowed considerably in May, and there was substantial non-guaranteed issuance. In Australia, the major banks had all now raised non-guaranteed debt. While one bank had issued non-guaranteed debt offshore, the majority of placements offshore continued to be guaranteed issues. Spreads had narrowed further over the past month, partly reflecting less guaranteed bond issuance. However, as benchmark yields on Commonwealth Government securities had risen, actual yields were now higher. ", " The Australian banks had continued to compete strongly for deposit inflows. ‘Special’ rates on deposits had been considerably higher than bank bill yields so far this year. This was putting upward pressure on funding costs. ", " Members were briefed on the recent pick-up in bond issuance by foreign issuers in Australia (‘kangaroo’ bonds), after a period of around a year in which there had been little activity in this market. This was also a sign of increased risk appetite as issuers took advantage of favourable cross-currency swap spreads. ", " US non-financial debt issuance had been strong in May, including sizeable issuance by lower-rated entities, and bond spreads along the rating spectrum had declined further. ", " Members observed that government bond yields had risen sharply around the world. In the United States, the yield curve was now as steep as it had been in previous decades. Nonetheless, actual yields across the curve remained low. ", " Australian government bond yields had tracked movements in global yields relatively closely, maintaining the spread to US government yields broadly steady. The slope of the Australian yield curve was fairly steep, but within the range seen in recent decades. Other domestic bond spreads had narrowed relative to Commonwealth Government securities as investors' risk appetite had increased. ", " Members noted that emerging market spreads had also narrowed significantly over the past month, in another positive sign of increased confidence in global economic prospects among investors. ", " Global equity markets had lost some momentum over the past month but, as at the time of the meeting, market levels were well above recent troughs. The rebound in emerging equity markets has been significantly stronger than in developed markets. In Australia, resources equity prices had risen over the past month, but there had been little change overall. There had been very strong equity raisings over recent months, in both the financial and other sectors, as firms sought to restructure their balance sheets. ", " In foreign exchange markets, there had been a broad-based depreciation of the US dollar over the month. The US dollar had depreciated by more than 6 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the course of May, but it was still higher than a year earlier. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated against most of the currencies in the trade-weighted basket, particularly the US dollar, to be about 7 per cent higher over the month. This had reduced the stimulus to the economy coming from the earlier depreciation. Much of the rise in the exchange rate over the past month had occurred in the offshore trading session, which suggested that currency movements at present were more reflective of changes in sentiment towards the US dollar and risk appetite more generally, rather than any specific re-assessment about Australia's economic prospects. ", " Reviewing monetary policy settings around the world, members noted that the European Central Bank was the only major central bank to change its policy rate over the preceding month. The rate was lowered to 1 per cent, with the ECB also announcing a program to purchase bonds. The Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank had continued with their unconventional monetary policies. Some other central banks had given public commitments to maintain their policy rates at low levels for a prolonged period in an effort to keep longer-term rates low. ", " In Australia, following some stronger economic data, market pricing suggested that the cash rate was expected to be held steady at this meeting, but there was still thought to be a possibility of further easing in the months ahead. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The latest information was consistent with the tentative assessments at the preceding meeting that the global economy was stabilising after two very weak quarters. Conditions in international financial markets had continued to improve, though sentiment remained fragile. Members judged that the most likely outcome over the next year or two would be subdued global growth overall, as households and financial institutions in many major countries would be repairing balance sheets for some time. This suggested that spare capacity would be increasing and inflation tending to decline for some time ahead. But downside risks to that outlook had lessened. ", " In Australia, the economy was experiencing a downturn but, on the information available so far, this would be less severe than in most other countries. Here too the outlook was for a fairly gradual expansion getting under way later in the year, with spare capacity tending to increase and inflation tending to decline. Recent information had not led to any downward revision to the outlook; if anything, some indicators had been on the stronger side. ", " Monetary policy had been eased significantly, and budgetary measures were also providing significant support to demand. Indications were that these policies were having some impact, though the full effects would take time yet to be seen. Board members did not see a pressing case for any further action at this meeting, though they viewed the inflation outlook as affording scope for some further easing of monetary policy, if that were to be needed to support demand at a later stage. Accordingly, members judged that maintaining the current stance of monetary policy for the time being would be consistent with fostering sustainable growth and low inflation, and would leave adequate flexibility to respond to developments as needed over the period ahead. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.0 per cent. "]}},

"], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Philip Lowe (Assistant Governor, Economic) ", " David Emanuel (Secretary), Anthony Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members began their discussion by focusing on the recent run of data, which provided further signs of stabilisation in the world economy. Output in the major economies was likely to have contracted by a significantly smaller amount in the June quarter than in the previous two quarters, while output in the developing countries of east Asia was likely to have recorded a substantial increase, underpinned by a pick-up in growth in China. Consumer sentiment had recently risen somewhat in a range of countries, after earlier sharp falls, although it remained relatively subdued. There were, as yet, few signs of a recovery in international trade, with the value of trade down around one-third from its peak in mid 2008, the largest decline in many years. ", " Turning to the recently released data for specific economies, members noted signs that the rate of deterioration in the United States had slowed and that the economy may be reaching a turning point. Survey-based measures of business conditions had improved significantly, though production and labour market data remained weak. Members also discussed the recent weakness in US consumption despite strong growth in after-tax income, as many households sought to reduce leverage and consolidate their balance sheets. ", " Recent data on the Chinese economy had been positive, with all major components of industrial production recording gains over the past few months. An area of notable strength was production of automobiles, where there were fiscal incentives to purchase new cars and light trucks. Other fiscal measures had led to a strong increase in public-sector investment, which had boosted the construction sector. Members expected that, over time, domestic demand was likely to play a more important role in driving growth in the Chinese economy than had been the case over the past couple of decades. ", " In Japan, recent data had been more encouraging than they had been for some time. There had been a slight rise in export volumes, after some very large falls, and surveyed business conditions were up strongly, to close to average levels. Corporate profits had, however, fallen sharply, to around the lowest level since the early 1980s, and measures of spare capacity were high. ", " In other parts of east Asia, conditions had also tended to improve. Data on exports showed the effect of increased Chinese demand, with a number of countries recording increased exports to China, but no recovery in exports to the developed countries. The inventory cycle was expected to contribute to growth, after the subtractions brought on by the rapid de-stocking in the March quarter. Members noted that the improved information flows made possible by new technologies meant that companies had responded very quickly to the synchronised global downturn in demand in the December quarter. ", " There had been some improvement in business sentiment in Europe and the United Kingdom in the past month or so, but the data on production and spending were still weak. ", " Members noted that, in contrast to the situation over the past year, international institutions were tending to revise up their growth forecasts for 2010. The large downside risks had abated. Nonetheless, the recovery was likely to be gradual, reflecting the weakness of consumption in the developed countries as households saved more, as well as the effects of the stress in the global financial system. Given this outlook, spare capacity was likely to accumulate for some time and unemployment in the advanced economies was likely to increase further. Members also observed that there had been a sharp decline in headline inflation in the major developed economies and China and that the price level had fallen over the past year in some countries, though this largely reflected developments in oil prices. Core inflation was still close to 2 per cent in the developed economies, but was generally expected to decline over the period ahead. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The GDP outcome for the March quarter had been surprisingly strong. Members noted the unusually large difference between the various measures of GDP. If the result was combined with the December quarter outcome, the picture was that the economy had contracted slightly over the six months to March. This seemed broadly consistent with other indicators. ", " Members noted Australia's remarkably strong export performance over the December and March quarters. Over this period, export volumes had increased by almost 2 per cent, whereas in other countries, export volumes had typically fallen by 10–20 per cent, with much larger falls being recorded in some cases. While the depreciation of the Australian dollar had been helpful to exporters, the strong performance of the Chinese economy was particularly important. Australia's exports of both iron ore and coal had recently rebounded after earlier large falls. ", " Looking at consumption, members noted that retail sales had increased strongly in May and were 7 per cent higher than in September, a considerably stronger outcome than in comparable countries. The staff's liaison with retailers suggested that this strength had continued into June. Members noted that the fiscal transfers had helped support retail sales, as had the stimulus for indebted households from lower interest rates. The effect of the fiscal transfers was also clearly apparent in the data on credit card repayments, which had increased around the time that these transfers were made. Consumer confidence had risen strongly. ", " Turning to the business sector, investment had fallen by 6 per cent in the March quarter, which was nonetheless stronger than the outcome in many other countries. While members noted that further falls in investment were likely, business sentiment had improved recently. Members also noted that car sales to businesses had increased significantly over the past couple of months, stimulated by tax incentives, notably for small businesses. They also discussed recent trends in business funding, noting that while business credit had fallen over recent months, this decline was accounted for by borrowings in foreign currency, which were likely to be funding offshore operations. While credit conditions had tightened for many borrowers, recently there had been some large corporate bond raisings and a large increase in issuance of equity. ", " Members considered recent trends in the housing market. The staff's liaison and data on first-home owner grants and housing lending suggested that some pick-up in housing construction was likely over the second half of the year. However, members noted that recent building approvals for medium-density dwellings had been weak, particularly outside the capital cities, partly reflecting reduced demand for holiday apartments, but also the tighter lending standards applying to property projects generally. ", " Members also noted that, according to a range of private-sector measures monitored by the staff, house prices had increased in almost all areas over recent months. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne were also high, though the number of sales by auction was not particularly high. Housing loan approvals were strong, and while existing borrowers had increased their loan repayments, overall housing credit had recorded solid growth. ", " Members noted that there had been a small fall in employment in May and that the unemployment rate had risen to 5.7 per cent. Although there had been little net change in employment over the past six months, there had been a large fall in hours worked. This reflected a shift in composition from full-time to part-time employment, as well as efforts by firms to preserve jobs by reducing working hours. Employment indicators from business surveys had recently been more positive, but job advertisements had fallen in June. ", " There had been no new major data on prices and wages since the previous meeting. Members noted that consumers' inflation expectations had increased slightly after falling sharply over the past year. The June quarter CPI was scheduled for release prior to the next meeting, at which time a revised set of forecasts would be provided to the Board. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that the conditions in financial markets had been mixed during the month. The general improvement in credit markets had continued, though the rise in share prices had lost momentum. Some of the earlier rise in government bond yields had been reversed. ", " The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England had continued to use unconventional monetary measures. The European Central Bank had injected liquidity into the banking system through a one-year repurchase agreement at a fixed rate of 1 per cent, which had prompted a fall in short-term rates of more than 30 basis points in the euro area. Elsewhere in Europe, central bank policy action had seen short-term rates fall by about 25 basis points in Sweden, and the Swiss National Bank had injected liquidity through its intervention to restrict the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. ", " In the United States, following stronger-than-expected employment data for May, financial markets had begun to price in a commencement of the monetary policy tightening cycle by year end. Over the course of the month, however, the expected start of the tightening cycle was pushed back, with market pricing now placing it around the end of the first quarter next year. ", " Members noted that conditions in money markets around the world had continued to improve, with spreads now at the levels prevailing prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In Australia, short-term money market spreads were now around the lowest levels in the period since the onset of the financial crisis. ", " The improvement in conditions had allowed the Bank to reduce the size of its balance sheet, after the sharp expansion earlier in the financial year. ", " Bond yields in Australia had tended to rise a little more than in other countries, and there had been a significant amount of issuance by banks and the State governments in recent weeks. ", " Global guaranteed bond issuance had slowed over the past few months as credit markets had improved. Guaranteed issuance had slowed particularly in the United States, where 10 of the 19 largest banks had repaid TARP funds, a precondition of which was an ability to issue unguaranteed debt. Overall bond issuance had been at a high level in Europe, where there had also been a rise in the proportion of unguaranteed debt being offered. ", " Australian banks had raised a considerable amount of funds through bond issuance and had continued to make relatively heavy use of the guarantee arrangements. There had already been significant issuance in the early part of July. Members noted that the Australian banks had continued to compete strongly for deposit inflows and were lengthening their debt maturity profiles. ", " In signs of improving credit market conditions, US corporate bond issuance had been high in the past two months across the rating spectrum. Corporates were accessing credit markets directly, in part because of the limited credit extension offered by banks at present. Corporate bond spreads had continued to narrow over the past month. ", " Members were briefed on the main features of the US financial regulatory reform package. ", " Turning to global share markets, members noted that movements in equity prices had been mixed over the past month; China stood out as recording strong gains. ", " In Australia, the share market had fallen overall, with resources stocks noticeably lower and other stocks little changed. For the 2008/09 financial year, there was a negative return of 24 per cent after a negative return of 17 per cent in the previous financial year. There had been very strong equity raising in aggregate in the past few months, as companies continued to reduce borrowings in an effort to lower their gearing ratios. Members noted that the strength of equity raising implied that total business funding had expanded, notwithstanding the decline in intermediated finance. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had been mixed across major trading partners' currencies over the month. It appreciated noticeably following the stronger-than-expected employment data early in June and, in net terms, was slightly higher on a trade-weighted basis over the month. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated during the month, reaching a nine-month high against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis, but had exhibited increased volatility. The Bank had taken the opportunity of the higher exchange rate to replenish foreign exchange reserves after last year's intervention. The recent appreciation had reduced the fall in the exchange rate over the past year to 13 per cent. ", " Markets expected the cash rate to be held steady at this meeting. Earlier in June, forward cash rates had revealed emerging expectations of a tightening by year end, in line with global developments, but these expectations had since been pushed back. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The information available to the Board at this meeting provided further evidence that the global economy was stabilising. Importantly for Australia, the Chinese economy was growing quite robustly, partly due to strong public-sector construction, and production had also picked up in a number of other Asian economies. Conditions in international credit markets had continued to improve, with risk premia declining, though the earlier run-up in equity markets had stalled in recent weeks. Members' assessment remained that the most likely outcome for the world economy over the next year or two would be subdued growth. Downside risks had diminished. Nonetheless, significant vulnerabilities remained, as households and financial institutions in many major countries continued to repair their balance sheets. The long-term impact of the large run-up in global government debt that was in prospect was also unclear. A subdued global recovery would see further increases in spare capacity, which meant that disinflationary pressures were likely to persist over the period ahead. ", " Recent information on the domestic economy suggested that economic activity was not as weak as had been expected. Exports had been surprisingly strong, which primarily reflected demand from China. Some mining companies and ports were reporting that they were again operating close to capacity. Household spending had increased due to the effects of the fiscal stimulus and low interest rates, and most indicators for the housing market suggested that demand in that sector was picking up. Housing loan approvals had recorded a strong increase, and house prices were again picking up, with the rises becoming more widespread. Both consumer and business confidence had rebounded strongly from their low points. The outlook thus remained for a gradual recovery to begin later in the year, and downside risks to that had diminished. Labour market indicators were likely to remain soft for some time, though there were signs that employers were making efforts to minimise job shedding. ", " In assessing the stance of monetary policy, members observed that the early and substantial easing of both monetary and fiscal policy had been effective in supporting demand, which, if anything, had been more resilient than expected. The full effects of policy measures would still be coming through for some time. Members noted that the current inflation outlook afforded scope for some further easing of monetary policy, if that were to be needed to give further support to demand at a later stage. ", " Accordingly, members judged the current stance of monetary policy to be consistent with fostering sustainable growth and low inflation, while leaving adequate flexibility to respond to developments as needed over the period ahead.

Global growth forecasts had been revised upwards for the first time in more than a year. ", " Measures of global industrial production showed some growth in the June quarter after earlier sharp declines. The recovery in industrial production had been strongest in China, where production had more than regained the falls in late 2008 and early 2009. Other east Asian economies (excluding Japan) had regained around two-thirds of earlier falls and production in Japan had also increased. Members noted that the recovery in Asian industrial production was positive for Australia, although industrial production was still very weak in the United States and the euro area. ", " Chinese GDP growth had surprised on the upside in the June quarter, reflecting the effects of significant monetary and fiscal stimulus. Members noted that there had been a number of measures to boost bank lending, and credit had grown at an annualised rate of 45 per cent in the first half of the year. Housing prices were also increasing again. Members also discussed the very strong growth in investment in China, especially in the central and western provinces, noting that there were some reasons to expect that high levels of investment could continue for some time yet. ", " There had also been an improvement in conditions in the higher-income economies in Asia. GDP growth in Korea had been strong in the June quarter, partly reflecting growth in household consumption, which had been boosted by temporary fiscal measures such as the incentives for the purchase of cars. June quarter GDP data were not yet available for Japan, but industrial production showed a strong pick-up after very large falls in late 2008 and early 2009. This pick-up was most noticeable in consumer durables, which had earlier seen the largest falls: this partly reflected government incentives to buy cars and energy-efficient appliances. ", " In the United States, output had again fallen in the June quarter, but by less than in the previous two quarters. Members noted that survey measures of business conditions had now returned to levels that were consistent with output no longer contracting. The outlook for the housing sector had improved, with measures of house prices no longer falling, and house sales and building starts showing small increases recently. In contrast, members noted that conditions in the commercial property market were still looking weak and that the impact of the weaker economy had not yet been fully reflected in banks' asset portfolios. ", " Conditions in the United Kingdom had been weak, with another significant decline in output in the June quarter, although the decline was smaller than in the December and March quarters. As in the United States, measures of confidence had improved, as had some housing indicators. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The news on the domestic economy had mostly been positive over the past month, with the economy continuing to hold up better than had been expected. Business surveys had continued to strengthen and consumer sentiment had risen sharply over the past two months. ", " Retail spending had been strong in the first part of the June quarter, which had been reflected in a 2 per cent increase in real spending in the quarter, according to data that became available during the meeting. Members discussed the likely durability of this strength, noting that data for the month of June had showed a reversal of some of the earlier gains, and staff liaison with retailers suggested that spending in July might be weaker than in earlier months. Members also noted, however, that there had been a significant increase in household wealth since March, reversing a considerable share of the earlier decline. ", " Housing loan approvals had strengthened considerably in the first five months of the year, especially for first-home buyers. Members noted that this increased demand had contributed to an increase in housing prices. Private-sector price measures had strengthened further in June, and the ABS data showed a very strong increase in the June quarter after being relatively weak in the March quarter. The recent strength in housing prices was fairly widespread, including in the higher-priced suburbs, where repeat buyers predominate. Members observed that the strength in housing prices also reflected other factors, including low mortgage rates, strong population growth and inelastic supply. They noted that commencements in recent years had been below estimates of underlying demand. The recent, albeit moderate, growth in building approvals for houses was positive, although approvals for apartments remained weak. ", " Members discussed some of the factors influencing the business sector. There had been some recent strength in spending on some forms of equipment, including motor vehicles. This had reflected the temporary tax allowances on such assets, and members expected that this boost would fade. Approvals for private non-residential construction had remained weak in the first half of the year, after falling significantly during the second half of 2008. This weakness was in part due to the sharp turnaround in conditions in the office property sector, where capital values had fallen significantly and vacancy rates were rising. Overall, business investment was expected to fall significantly as a share of GDP over 2009 and 2010, but it would still remain quite high by historical standards. Partly offsetting this weakness, there was likely to be a pick-up in public investment spending, with the public building approvals data for June showing a very large increase, as the Australian Government initiatives on education spending began to take effect. ", " Members discussed trends in business financing. They noted that while business credit had fallen over the first half of this year, businesses had raised significant funds from capital and equity markets. Within bank credit, the decline in the first half of this year had been in lending to corporates. Credit to unincorporated enterprises had declined in the second half of 2008, but had grown in 2009 to date. Members noted, however, that the terms and conditions of lending had typically been tightened significantly relative to pre-crisis levels. ", " Labour market data for June showed a fall in employment and a modest increase in the unemployment rate. The fall in aggregate employment in this downturn had been quite small, though the data for hours worked had showed a larger decline. Overall, the deterioration in the labour market had recently been less than expected earlier in the year. ", " CPI inflation had slowed to 1.5 per cent over the year to the June quarter. The decline in measures of underlying inflation had been more gradual, to around 0.8 per cent in the quarter and 3¾ per cent over the year. The unusually large gap between the CPI and underlying inflation was mostly accounted for by the large fall in petrol prices around the turn of the year, and the estimated fall in the price of deposit and loan facilities used by households. ", " Members discussed the revised staff forecasts prepared for the meeting. The central forecast for GDP through 2009 had been revised from a decline of 1 per cent to a rise of ½ per cent. About half of this revision reflected the stronger-than-expected GDP data for the March quarter. It was noted that the wide discrepancy in the various estimates of GDP suggested that this figure was subject to greater-than-usual uncertainty. More generally, the upward revision to the forecast reflected a view that exports, business investment, household consumption and dwelling investment would all be stronger than earlier expected. The outlook for 2010 was also slightly stronger. Members noted that it was still unclear how much of the greater-than-expected recent buoyancy in the economy might have been due to the temporary effects of earlier fiscal stimulus. Overall, however, they concurred that the economic outlook had improved. ", " The central forecast for underlying inflation was broadly unchanged in the near term, but the upward revision to the growth outlook meant that the trough in inflation was unlikely to be as low as had been previously expected. The staff forecasts now suggested that underlying inflation would fall to about 2 per cent around late 2010 and early 2011. "], "Financial Markets": [" There had been a material improvement in conditions in financial markets over the past month, especially in the two weeks leading up to the meeting. ", " Internationally, spreads in money markets had continued to fall and were now clearly below the levels that had prevailed shortly before the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September. In the case of Australia, the bank bills to OIS spread was at its lowest level since the onset of the crisis in mid 2007. ", " Spreads on government-guaranteed issuance had also tended to narrow. The amount of government-guaranteed issuance globally was also falling. Australian banks were increasing their issuance of unguaranteed debt, including in offshore markets, though they had continued to issue sizeable amounts of guaranteed debt. ", " Members noted developments in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Usage of the shorter-term emergency liquidity facilities had fallen, but the Fed had continued to buy Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. These purchases had helped to reduce mortgage yields. Overall, the size of the Fed's balance sheet had not changed much since the start of the year. ", " In the case of the Reserve Bank, however, all of last year's expansion in the balance sheet had now been reversed, which was another sign of the normalisation of Australian markets. Exchange settlement balances had been reduced to a little over $1 billion, which was only marginally higher than their pre-crisis levels. ", " Members noted that the general improvement in financial markets had also been reflected in increases of around 10 per cent in global equity prices over the past month. Equity prices had now risen by around 40 per cent from the lows earlier this year. The market had been bolstered by earnings reports from a number of the large global banks, which had benefited from strong earnings from investment banking activities; profits from commercial banking activities were more restrained. There had been larger recoveries in emerging equity markets, notably in China, where prices had doubled from earlier lows. ", " The Australian share market had increased broadly in line with markets in other developed economies. Resource shares had risen especially strongly since the previous Board meeting, consistent with the rise in commodity prices. Members noted that equity raisings had been particularly strong recently, amounting to 7 per cent of market capitalisation over the past year. ", " In currency markets, the US dollar had tended to depreciate over the past month, while the Australian dollar had continued to appreciate, to be at its highest levels since September 2008. It had reversed around two-thirds of the decline from the peak levels in July last year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" On the basis of the available information, members judged that financial markets had improved substantially and that the global economic outlook was also better. Output was stabilising in the advanced economies and recovering quite strongly in Asia. Forecasts for global growth, while still low, were being raised for the first time in a year. The risks of a further large slump had diminished, though had not disappeared. ", " The strong rebound in China and some other countries in Asia was supporting the prices and volumes of Australia's exports, to a greater extent than expected earlier in the year. Domestic demand had also been stronger than expected. Although some of the recent strength in the domestic economy might be temporary, partly reflecting policy measures, the outlook for domestic spending had improved, given the significant recovery in measures of household and business confidence. Accordingly, the staff had revised their growth forecasts upwards. The revised forecasts were still for sluggish output performance in the near term, but embodied a strengthening of growth during 2010 and 2011. The latest CPI inflation figures showed that inflation had fallen in underlying terms as expected and further declines were still anticipated. The recent appreciation of the exchange rate would dampen the effects coming from the earlier depreciation, as well as dampening activity at the margin. But the upward revision to the growth forecasts meant that inflation was not expected to fall as low as previously thought. ", " Members noted that the cash rate had been reduced to the current very low level in anticipation of very weak economic outcomes. In recent months, members had left open the possibility of further reductions in the cash rate should further downside risks to the economy emerge. Given the recent improvement in the global and domestic outlooks, it now appeared unlikely that this would be necessary. In fact, if the economy evolved as anticipated in the forecasts, the Bank would in due course need to adopt a less expansionary policy stance. ", " In discussing the timing and process of removing some of the current expansionary policy setting, members noted that it would, when it began, involve balancing two risks. There was a risk of overstaying a very accommodative setting in a recovering economy, particularly when underlying inflation still needed to decline to reach the target. On the other hand, there was a risk of an early tightening choking off confidence and demand prematurely. A particular source of uncertainty was whether the recent growth in household spending was due mainly to the temporary fiscal measures, in which case it would probably soon fade, a more general decline in risk aversion, or the more persistent effects of lower interest rates. Information over the period ahead would be important in judging this. ", " Having considered the issues, the Board judged the current stance of monetary policy to be consistent with fostering sustainable growth and low inflation, while leaving adequate flexibility to respond to developments as needed over the period ahead. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.0 per cent. "]}},

Data for June quarter GDP were now available for most economies and showed that growth in the Asian region had been much stronger than elsewhere. However, there had been some upside surprises in other countries, including positive growth in France and Germany in the quarter. Industrial production in a number of countries had been boosted by incentives for the purchase of cars and other durable goods. There was therefore a question about the sustainability of the recovery, in particular whether the growth that had been seen was largely a one-off effect of stimulus measures or if there was also a fundamental improvement. ", " Members discussed the divergence that was being seen in different parts of the global economy. In recent years, there had been much discussion about the desirability of stronger demand growth in Asian economies and this was now occurring. To the extent that Asia continued to grow more strongly than elsewhere, this would be positive for the Australian economy, with Australia's largest export destinations now in Asia. ", " Members were briefed on the recent data for the Chinese economy, which had been somewhat mixed. Car sales had risen very sharply and export volumes had also been growing, including recently to the United States and Europe. However, growth in industrial production, fixed asset investment and credit was estimated to have slowed. Members also discussed trends in the Chinese steel industry, including what evidence was available on the build-up of inventories of iron ore and steel. Overall, members observed that some slowing in the Chinese economy relative to the rapid pace in the June quarter had been inevitable but that the longer-term prospects were strong. ", " Developments elsewhere in Asia indicated that growth was continuing to recover. India had recorded two quarters of solid growth in the first half of 2009, boosted by an easing of both fiscal and monetary policy. In South Korea, industrial production had grown by nearly 30 per cent since the start of the year and was now back to its previous peak. There had been a particularly strong recovery in production of electronic components, some of which were exported to China for assembly. The Japanese economy was also doing better than earlier expected, though part of the growth in the June quarter was accounted for by measures to boost sales of cars and household appliances. Nevertheless, there was a significant amount of spare capacity, with Japanese output 7½ per cent below its peak and the unemployment rate, at 5.7 per cent in July, at the highest level in the five decades for which there were comparable data. ", " The data for the United States indicated that the pace of deterioration in the labour market was easing. However, household spending had shown essentially no growth so far this year, and the household saving rate had risen. The US economy was expected to grow in the September quarter, after contracting by 4 per cent over the previous year. ", " Members were briefed on global trends in credit growth and housing markets. Developments in business credit had been fairly similar across countries, with falls in 2009 in a number of advanced economies as companies reduced debt levels in an environment of tighter credit standards by lenders. In relation to housing markets, members observed that in countries that had experienced better economic outcomes and/or fewer financial sector problems (e.g. China, Canada, Norway and Australia), house prices now appeared to be rising quite solidly and were above or around earlier peaks. Even in the US and UK, which had earlier experienced significant falls in house prices, there had been some up-ticks recently. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The flow of information on the Australian economy over the past month had been mostly positive. The staff's expectation was that GDP data for the June quarter, due to be released the day after the meeting, would show a moderate increase in output, with growth in household consumption, business investment, public spending and exports. ", " Measures of sentiment had continued to strengthen. Consumer sentiment had risen sharply over the three months to August. Liaison with retailers suggested that household spending had softened somewhat in July but had been better in August. ", " Measures of business confidence and business sentiment had also risen to be modestly above average. The data for business investment in the June quarter indicated a strong rise in spending on plant and equipment, with a sharp increase in spending on a wide range of capital goods, including cars. However, this mostly reflected the bringing forward of spending to qualify for tax allowances. Car sales had subsequently fallen in July. Building construction had fallen sharply in the June quarter, but engineering construction had risen strongly. ", " Members discussed the broader outlook for investment, which – as a share of GDP – was around the highest levels in the 50-year history of the national accounts. The capital expenditure survey pointed to some near-term weakness in private investment, though less than expected earlier in the year. Developments in the resources sector, especially for LNG, pointed to significant strength in the medium term. Public investment would increase because of the fiscal stimulus packages and state government infrastructure plans. Members also discussed the trend in dwelling investment. They noted that even though the number of new dwellings completed had been lower in recent years, dwelling investment as a share of GDP had held up, due to the trend towards larger and higher-quality homes and an increase in the share of alterations and additions. ", " Business credit data showed a further fall in July, but there were some tentative signs of a slowing in the rate of decline. Equity raisings had remained strong. The most recent profits data showed a pick-up in the non-mining sector in the June quarter, but mining profits had declined following earlier falls in commodity prices. ", " The data for June quarter export volumes showed most categories were growing or holding up reasonably well. Manufacturing exports were the exception, and had fallen broadly in line with the falls seen in many other countries. On average, commodity prices had been broadly steady since the last meeting. Iron ore spot prices had weakened over the previous couple of weeks, although they remained above the contract prices agreed with Japanese and Korean steel mills. ", " The most recent monthly labour market data continued to suggest that the deterioration in the numbers employed and in unemployment had been less than feared earlier in the year. There had been a noticeable increase in flexibility in hours worked. Members noted that this had been beneficial for firms, employees and the broader economy. ", " The wage price index showed a significant moderation in private-sector wage growth over the first half of the year, although public-sector wage growth had not slowed much. The slowing in private-sector wage growth was consistent with reports that some companies had implemented wage freezes, and members judged that it would be helpful in minimising job losses and in exerting some downward pressure on underlying inflation from the current elevated levels. "], "Financial Markets": [" Sentiment in financial markets had generally consolidated further over the previous month. ", " Spreads in money markets had narrowed further, gradually returning towards more normal levels. There had been no significant changes in monetary policy in the major economies, although the Bank of England had expanded its asset purchase program. ", " Issuance in global bond markets had been subdued in August, mostly reflecting the northern summer holidays, and there had been a very significant drop-off in issuance of government‑guaranteed debt. Members noted that recent guaranteed issuance in the Australian market had mostly been by branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks. The major banks had raised some longer-term offshore unguaranteed debt at a yield that was only slightly above the all-in cost of a guaranteed issue. ", " There were some favourable signs in the Australian residential mortgage-backed securities market. The gap between secondary market yields and primary market yields was continuing to close, such that the prospect of issuance without the support of the Australian Office of Financial Management was increasing. ", " Equity markets had mostly strengthened over the past month, with China a notable exception. Chinese equities had fallen significantly from their recent peak, with concerns over the rapid credit expansion and its possible curtailment contributing to significant volatility, which had spilt over to other markets on occasion. ", " The Australian equity market had risen, especially financial sector stocks. Although underlying profits of Australian companies had fallen significantly, recent earnings reports had mostly met or exceeded analyst expectations. Issuance of new equity had been running very strongly in the quarter to date. ", " Turning to banks' funding, members noted that there had been a continuation of the strong competition for deposits. Together with an increase in term interest rates, which were rising because of expectations of monetary tightening, this was contributing to an increase in bank funding costs. Banks had raised interest rates on their fixed-rate lending and members noted there was market speculation that variable mortgage rates might also be increased. Average business lending rates had risen slightly, as banks continued to adjust customer risk margins upwards as loan facilities were renewed. "], "Financial System": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. The discussion focused on the improvement in conditions in the global financial sector over the past six months; the resilience of the Australian financial system; improvements in sentiment among Australian households and businesses; and developments in regulation of the financial sector. ", " Members noted that the extreme risk aversion prevailing in global markets in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse last year had dissipated. Investors had become more confident, which was evident in a bounce-back in global equity prices. The recovery in share prices had been proportionately larger for banks than the broader equity market. There had been similarities in the performance of the Australian equity market. ", " Members observed that financial conditions in some key countries remained challenging, as macroeconomic conditions continued to weigh on loan quality. Commercial property seemed to be a key point of weakness in several countries. ", " Members noted that the Australian financial system had continued to perform relatively strongly. Although loan impairments were rising, mainly relating to business lending, the large Australian banks had reported solid profits for the latest half-year, as they had throughout the period of the financial crisis. The banks remained well capitalised, and had strengthened their positions further with additional raisings during the past year. With investor risk appetite returning, banks had been increasingly willing to tap markets on their own credit standing and without the support of the government guarantee in the past couple of months. ", " Members discussed overall lending standards, which had clearly tightened since the start of the crisis. They noted that while larger companies had been reducing debt and banks had reduced exposures, credit remained available to high-quality borrowers, albeit at higher spreads. Although commercial property was currently the largest component of non-performing assets, the construction cycle had not been as pronounced as in the late 1980s. This suggested that there was a smaller amount of overbuilding in the market, including in Perth and Brisbane, where the largest falls in commercial capital values had been seen to date. ", " In the non-financial sector, members noted that sentiment among Australian households and businesses had improved significantly. Many firms were still trying to strengthen their balance sheets by reducing debt and raising equity. For households, net worth had fallen during the past year but the latest figures showed it was now recovering, reflecting higher prices for both shares and houses. Members observed that household interest payments as a share of disposable income had fallen substantially and that household borrowing was growing at a moderate rate. ", " On regulatory developments, members noted the ongoing debate in various international fora. Details on possible changes to regulations covering bank capital and other standards were still being worked out, but were likely to result in higher capital and liquidity requirements around the world. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The information presented to members showed that the situation in the global economy was continuing to improve. Of most significance to Australia, the Asian region had recorded strong growth in the June quarter. While this had been largely driven by domestic demand in these economies, reflecting strong economic stimulus, there were also recent signs of a pick-up in their exports. Outside Asia, most economies had experienced another fall in GDP in the June quarter, though more recent information suggested that the majority of these economies were now approaching a turning point. ", " An important question for members was whether the global economic improvement would be sustained, or whether it was mainly a reflection of the strong macroeconomic stimulus that had been applied over the past year and might in due course fade. Members were also conscious that, even though financial market conditions had improved significantly and debt markets were beginning to function again, banks, corporates and households in many countries still faced significant balance sheet adjustments. This too could serve to limit growth. ", " Members concluded on balance that the global economy was most likely on a sustained, if modest, recovery path, though it was still too soon to be confident of this assessment. ", " Members noted that indicators of the domestic economy over the past month had again been better than expected. GDP figures due to be published the next day would most likely show that a moderate rise in output had occurred in the June quarter, which meant that the slowdown in GDP had been significantly less than forecast earlier in the year. Consumption, investment and exports had all shown unexpected resilience. Measures of confidence of both households and businesses had recovered strongly. ", " Members noted that it was hard to disentangle the contribution that Asian demand, fiscal stimulus and easier monetary policy had each made to the better-than-expected outcomes. There were signs that some of the unexpected strength in investment in the June quarter owed to the pull-forward of spending to qualify for tax concessions that ended in June, but investment plans for the year ahead had also been revised up. Information from liaison suggested that household spending might be holding up reasonably well even several months after the government payments had ended. There were some signs that Chinese demand for resources had not continued at the exceptional pace of the June quarter, but liaison with resources companies suggested that they were very confident about medium-term prospects. ", " Members also noted that business credit was still very weak and that borrowers were facing tight credit conditions and rising borrowing costs as banks continued to review risk margins as lending facilities were renewed. For some sectors, particularly those related to property, this was likely to continue to be a brake on economic activity in the near term. The rise in market yields, in expectation of a monetary tightening, was also adding to borrowing costs. ", " Members were reassured by the clear signs of wage moderation in the economy, as this would help to contain inflation in the near term. Nonetheless, with underlying inflation still relatively high on the latest reading and economic activity substantially stronger than expected, members were conscious of the need to balance the task of controlling inflation over the medium term with that of supporting economic recovery. ", " At the previous meeting, members had agreed that if the economy continued to evolve as in the latest forecasts, the Bank would in due course need to adopt a less expansionary policy stance. The information at this meeting suggested that economic conditions were indeed evolving broadly in that way. Nonetheless, some uncertainty remained about the outlook both abroad and at home. ", " As at the previous meeting, members noted that the policy decision in the near term involved balancing the risk of over‑staying an accommodative stance, and that of prematurely tightening and adversely affecting confidence and demand. ", " The meeting concluded that the balance was best struck by leaving the cash rate unchanged for the time being, pending further evaluation of incoming information at future meetings. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.0 per cent. "]}},

Global forecasts had been revised up, with the recent IMF forecasts showing a modest upward revision for 2009 and a significant upward revision for 2010. World growth in 2010 (based on purchasing power parity weights) was now forecast at 3.1 per cent, up from 1.9 per cent in April. Although growth in the G7 economies was forecast to be relatively weak, the rest of the world was forecast to grow at over 4 per cent, with growth significantly higher than this in some countries in Asia, most notably China. Overall, growth in Australia's major trading partners in 2010 was forecast by the IMF at around 3¾ per cent, which was close to trend. ", " Members discussed the drivers and expected durability of the recovery that was under way. Part of the recent improvement in demand and production had been due to fiscal incentives to buy cars and other durable goods, and it remained to be seen what would transpire following the expiry of some of these schemes. The inventory cycle was also contributing temporarily to growth in a number of countries. Where that had occurred, a durable recovery would require sustained growth in private demand. In the emerging economies, there would have to be reduced reliance on external demand and greater efforts to foster domestic-led growth. ", " Consumer sentiment had fallen to very low levels in early 2009 in some of the large advanced economies. Sentiment had since recovered somewhat, which would be helpful in encouraging demand, but it remained well below long-run average levels in many economies. In Australia, the fall had been less pronounced and the recovery had taken consumer confidence measures to well-above-average levels. ", " The data for the Chinese economy suggested solid growth in August after an easing in some indicators in July. GDP growth was expected to be quite strong for the September quarter, although not as rapid as in the June quarter. Monthly growth in credit had remained below the very strong pace seen earlier in the year, but there were indications of a pick-up in growth in lending to households, partly reflecting policy measures. Elsewhere in Asia, there had been a pause in the recovery in exports and industrial production in August in a number of economies, although some early data for September suggested that growth was continuing. ", " Data for the US economy had been mixed, but prospects appeared to be gradually improving. The most recent labour market data had been weaker than expected, but household consumption spending had risen over the three months to August, even after accounting for the policy-induced boost in spending on cars. The inventory cycle had subtracted significantly from GDP growth up to now, but this could be expected to end soon, providing a near-term boost to growth. ", " Members discussed trends in global consumer price inflation. The earlier falls in the price of oil had resulted in negative year-ended headline inflation rates in many countries. Measures of core inflation had also drifted downwards, and were now a little below medium-term targets in a number of the advanced economies. In China and some Asian economies, even core inflation had recently been negative but it appeared that the decline might have mostly run its course. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members reviewed the June quarter national accounts, which had been released the day after the previous Board meeting. Based on the average of the three measures, GDP was estimated to have grown by around 1 per cent in the first half of the year, which was stronger than had been expected earlier in the year and better than in many other economies. Outcomes for exports, business investment and household consumption had all been materially stronger than expected. Nevertheless, members noted that the fall in the terms of trade over the past year had resulted in a fall in Australia's real gross domestic income. ", " The more recent data had suggested that the economy was continuing to expand. Business surveys showed confidence at high levels and business conditions a little above average levels. Survey measures of capacity utilisation showed a slight pick-up relative to earlier in the year. ", " Household spending appeared to have remained relatively resilient, consistent with the high level of consumer sentiment. Retail spending increased in August after falls in the previous two months. Liaison suggested that motor vehicle spending by households had also been quite strong. Housing markets were quite buoyant, with dwelling prices estimated to have risen by around 2 per cent in August. Prices had increased in all the major capitals and in both higher- and lower-price suburbs. Data from private-sector providers suggested that nationwide prices were now above the earlier peaks seen late in 2007 and early in 2008. ", " Members discussed the extent to which the growth in the economy had been affected by fiscal policy measures. Staff estimates suggested that the impact of fiscal policy (including payments to households and other ongoing programs) on GDP growth was likely to have peaked in the June quarter and was now gradually declining. ", " There were divergent trends in activity in the construction sector. Building approvals for houses had risen significantly since late 2008, and there had also been some growth in approvals for low-rise medium-density housing. However, approvals for higher-rise apartments were very weak, partly reflecting financing problems. Members noted that, given the strong population growth, the current rate of housing construction meant that the average household size was increasing. In the non-residential sector there had been a sharp increase in approvals in the education sector, but approvals for other types of construction remained low. ", " Housing loan approvals in recent months had been well above the lows seen in 2008. However, growth in housing credit had not picked up much, implying that net repayments had risen. This probably reflected the fact that many households with home loans had not sought to lower their monthly payments when mortgage rates had fallen and had instead paid down their loan balances ahead of schedule. This would reduce the vulnerability of that part of the household sector to rising mortgage rates. ", " The pace of deterioration in the labour market had slowed substantially; the unemployment rate had been steady for several months and the earlier significant fall in hours worked appeared to be easing. Surveys suggested that households were no longer expecting a sharp rise in unemployment. Liaison with businesses indicated that the extreme caution in hiring plans earlier in the year was gradually being unwound. Measures of advertised job vacancies had also started to rise, albeit from levels well below earlier peaks. ", " Exports of coal and iron ore were estimated to have risen significantly in the September quarter. Steel production outside of China had now grown by around 20 per cent, after a very sharp fall late in 2008. Production in China had been quicker to recover, after a smaller fall. However, with steel prices falling, the Chinese authorities were now taking measures to slow growth by closing down some smaller mills. Spot iron ore prices remained well above the levels that had been set in contracts with the Japanese and Korean mills earlier in the year. ", " Members discussed the long-term outlook for the resources sector. Mining investment had grown strongly in recent years; as a share of GDP, it was currently well above the peaks in earlier resources booms. This was likely to rise further in coming years, reflecting growth in the LNG sector and ongoing strong investment in the coal and iron ore sectors. This would be positive for the economy as a whole, but would present challenges for some sectors as it would require a significant reallocation of resources in the economy. ", " Members also discussed the latest staff forecasts and the risks around the outlook. The forecasts assumed a rise in the cash rate over the year ahead. Growth was now expected to be around trend in 2010 and subsequently to strengthen somewhat. Inflation was expected to decline in the near term, reflecting both the current level of spare capacity in the economy and the recent relatively slow growth in labour costs. However, the forecast trough in inflation was not as low as previously expected, and by 2011 inflation could be rising again. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that the general improvement in conditions in financial markets had led some central banks to announce termination dates for arrangements introduced to support markets at the height of the financial crisis a year ago. This included the cessation of the guarantee on money market mutual funds in the US and a winding back of the Federal Reserve's term auction facility and the US dollar swap facility. Most central banks had continued to leave their policy rates unchanged over the past month and the market pricing suggested that policy rates in the major economies were expected to remain at current levels for some time yet. ", " Money market spreads had fallen to low levels in the major markets and also in Australia, where they were now only a little above pre-crisis levels. Members noted that the longer-dated repurchase agreements entered into by the Reserve Bank at the height of the crisis were now maturing, and as a result there had been a marked decline in the average maturity of the Bank's outstanding repurchase agreements. ", " Government bond yields had been little changed over the past month, despite concerns in some quarters about the large amount of issuance in several major countries. Bond yields in Australia had tended to decline slightly. There had been very strong demand for the $4 billion of indexed bonds issued by the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) late in September. This was the first issuance of indexed bonds since 2003. ", " Members were informed that the issuance of government-guaranteed bonds globally was relatively low in September. Australian institutions had accounted for about a third of global guaranteed issuance in the past three months. Members noted that guarantee schemes were being significantly curtailed or modified in several countries. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had announced the end of the program in its current form at the end of October, with a possible six-month extension, at a high fee, for institutions that were unable to issue unguaranteed debt or had difficulty rolling over maturing debt. ", " The share of unguaranteed bonds issued by Australian banks in September had risen to almost half of their total issuance, compared with 5 per cent in the March quarter and a third of their total issuance in the June quarter. The major banks' issuance in the local market was entirely unguaranteed, but they had issued both guaranteed and unguaranteed paper offshore. The foreign-owned banks operating in Australia had continued to issue a sizeable volume of guaranteed paper. These changing issuance patterns had reflected pricing incentives, with it now being cheaper for the major banks to issue unguaranteed bonds domestically than guaranteed bonds. ", " Conditions in Australian securitised markets had improved noticeably in the past month; for the first time in a year, there was a successful issue of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) without the support of the AOFM. The continuing decline in the outstanding stock of RMBS had seen spreads in the secondary market decline considerably, such that investors were now seeking new issues at prices that were economic for the issuers. ", " Global share markets had risen slightly over the past month, to be more than 50 per cent above the trough in March, though share prices were still around a third below the recent peaks. Forward price-earnings ratios were now generally around the long-run average. The Australian share market had experienced similar movements to markets elsewhere over the past month, with financial stocks generally performing better than other sectors. Members noted that there had been a particularly strong rise in banks' share prices in several countries since the trough, notably Australia and Canada. ", " The high level of equity raisings in the September quarter in Australia had led to a marked reduction in corporate gearing ratios, which were now down to around 65 per cent. For some highly leveraged corporates, asset write-downs had limited the effect of the equity raisings on their gearing ratios. ", " Turning to foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had depreciated by 15 per cent since its recent peak in March, falling against almost all the currencies in its trade-weighted basket. A notable exception had been the pound sterling, which had fallen further against many currencies. The depreciation of the US dollar had unwound two-thirds of its appreciation that had occurred since the trough in March 2008. ", " The Australian dollar had continued to appreciate over the past month, reaching a 14-month high against the US dollar; on a trade-weighted basis it was about 8 per cent higher over the past year. The appreciation of the Australian dollar in recent months had reflected the generally improving sentiment in financial markets, the relative outperformance of the Australian economy and the strength of commodity prices. ", " Members discussed trends in capital flows. They noted that net inflows of portfolio equity capital had accounted for a significant share of private capital inflows to Australia since the December quarter 2008, in contrast to earlier periods in which debt capital inflows predominated. ", " Domestically, banks had continued to compete aggressively for deposit funding. While this had placed upward pressure on funding costs, the effect on banks' overall funding costs had been approximately offset by the contraction in spreads. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Overall, the information becoming available over the past month had provided further evidence that the outlook for the domestic and global economies was continuing to improve. ", " Data on the global economy suggested that prospects for all the major regions of the world were improving, though some more noticeably than others. The recovery in the advanced economies was relatively subdued, and was expected to remain so owing to on-going balance sheet adjustments following the past couple of years of financial difficulties. The Asian economies, on the other hand, had picked up strongly over the past six months and the outlook was quite positive. Overall, growth in Australia's major trading partners over the forecast period was expected to be relatively close to trend. ", " Conditions in the domestic economy had for some time been noticeably stronger than had earlier been expected. Growth forecasts were tending to be revised up. Measures of both household and business confidence had recovered, household spending had remained relatively resilient, house-building activity was in the process of picking up and the risks of a sharp contraction in business investment had receded noticeably. The impact of public-sector spending on infrastructure was starting to become apparent. Absent further setbacks, GDP growth could be close to trend through 2010. Inflation was likely to decline in the near term but probably not fall as far as earlier expected. At its previous two meetings, the Board had noted the improvement in the economy and had agreed that, if prospects for the economy continued to strengthen, in due course there would be a need to adopt a less expansionary policy stance. The question facing the Board was whether the continued picture of improving conditions and prospects over the past month meant that the point had now been reached where the cash rate should be increased. ", " Members discussed the risks that a move at this meeting would be premature. Key among them was that economic prospects for most of the developed world were still uncertain and the possibility of another downturn in some countries could not be ruled out. While such an outcome would no doubt be detrimental to confidence, including in Australia, members noted that prospects for Australia were being affected significantly by developments in the Asian region, which was doing relatively well despite weakness in the advanced economies. Members also noted that a sizeable gap had opened up between the performance of Australia and other developed economies, and the Board had to be mindful of local conditions in setting policy. ", " Members noted that there was still a possibility that the recent strength in the domestic economy had been largely due to the greater-than-expected impact of the fiscal stimulus, which left open the attendant risk that activity might slow as that stimulus faded. It was also likely that the appreciation of the exchange rate would act as a contractionary influence on activity and help contain inflation. These considerations weighed in favour of keeping the current policy setting for a while longer so as to evaluate further data. ", " On the other hand, members judged that, compared with previous meetings, the risks in waiting had increased. In particular, underlying inflation was still, on the latest data, above the target and, while current forecasts suggested it would fall in the coming year, the expected trough in inflation was significantly higher than earlier thought. Keeping interest rates at very low levels for an extended period could therefore threaten the achievement of the inflation target over the medium term. More generally, very expansionary policy could result in the build-up of other imbalances in the economy, which would ultimately be detrimental to economic growth. ", " Overall, members concluded that, while downside risks to the domestic economy could not be ruled out, they had diminished significantly over recent months. This meant that the balance of risks was now such that the current very expansionary setting of policy was no longer necessary, and possibly imprudent. The Board therefore decided in favour of raising the cash rate. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to raise the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.25 per cent, effective 7 October. "]}},

", " In the case of the United States, this growth came after four quarters of contraction. Private demand was growing, with the car scrappage scheme boosting consumption spending, and the inventory cycle was also contributing to growth. Dwelling investment had grown for the first time in about four years, helped by incentives for first-home buyers. More generally, the housing market appeared to have bottomed, with most price measures now showing stabilisation or growth. However, the labour market remained weak, with the decline in payrolls in this recession much larger than in earlier episodes. ", " China had continued to grow strongly, with GDP growth estimated at around 2¼ per cent in the September quarter, following growth of around 4 per cent in the previous quarter. Domestic demand growth remained firm. Import volumes also expanded strongly in the September quarter, and were now above earlier peaks. Members noted that the growth in Chinese imports was significant both in the boost it was providing to activity in other countries and as evidence of some shift towards more domestic-led growth. Credit had continued to grow strongly, albeit more slowly than the extraordinary pace seen in the first half of the year. There had been a shift recently towards lending to households, partly reflecting a range of policies that had encouraged borrowing by households. ", " Industrial production and exports in India were also growing strongly. In South Korea, GDP had grown by around 3 per cent in the September quarter, including a large contribution from inventories. More broadly, data for the east Asian economies had been positive, with industrial production and exports both growing strongly in September after a pause in August. Both series were now not too far below their earlier peaks. Monetary conditions in these economies were quite stimulatory, with policy rates in many countries at or below 2 per cent. Inflation in most countries in the region remained low, but a number were now experiencing solid growth in housing prices. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that there had been further evidence that conditions in the Australian labour market were turning out to be better than had been expected earlier in the year. The estimates for September showed an increase in employment and a small fall in the unemployment rate. The improvement in the labour market was also apparent in advertised job vacancies and hiring intentions in business surveys. ", " Staff liaison had pointed to retailers experiencing mixed conditions in September and October, although the broader perspective was that spending appeared to have held up reasonably well given that the earlier boost from the payments to households was fading. Consumer sentiment had risen further in early October to be close to the highest levels in the history of the series. Responses to forward-looking survey questions had been particularly strong. ", " Recent business surveys had been broadly positive. It was noteworthy that survey measures of capacity utilisation had showed a modest pick-up over recent months, and the levels of these series suggested that there was now less spare capacity in the economy than had been expected earlier in the year. ", " Business credit had fallen by 1.3 per cent in September, a larger fall than in earlier months, and by around 6 per cent since late 2008. The weakness was in credit to incorporated firms, with credit to smaller unincorporated entities having risen modestly in 2009. Many larger firms appeared to have replaced bank credit with debt and equity financing in the capital markets. As a result, the overall external funding to the business sector was still growing. ", " Members discussed developments in the housing market. Monthly measures of housing prices had been broadly flat in September, after strong increases in August. Members noted the weak outlook for construction of apartments, in contrast to the current strong population growth. Among the possible causes discussed were the roles played by tighter lending standards on the part of banks and the costs of new development from the zoning and approvals processes. ", " With both the population and the capital stock growing at rates that were high by both historical and international standards, the medium-term production capacity of the economy was expanding, though measured growth in productivity had been weak in recent years. ", " Members were briefed on the most recent inflation data. CPI inflation had been 1 per cent in the September quarter and 1.3 per cent over the year, with the low annual outcome reflecting earlier falls in petrol prices and in the ABS estimate of the prices of deposit and loan facilities. There had been strong growth in prices in the housing component of the CPI, especially in electricity, water and gas prices. Food prices had fallen for the second consecutive quarter, after earlier strong increases. The staff's assessment was that underlying inflation had been around 0.8 per cent in the quarter and 3½ per cent over the year, down from a peak of a little over 4½ per cent a year earlier. This was broadly in line with expectations that price pressures would gradually decline, reflecting the earlier slowing in the economy, the slowing in wage growth and the higher exchange rate. ", " The staff forecasts were broadly similar to those discussed at the previous meeting. The outlook for commodity prices and the terms of trade had strengthened over recent months, and market expectations were for increases in the contract prices of coal and iron ore in 2010. GDP growth was expected to be close to trend over 2010, rising to around 3½ per cent by the end of the forecast period. Growth in the resources sector was expected to be strong, especially in the LNG industry. Underlying inflation was expected to fall gradually to around 2¼ per cent in 2010 before picking up to around 2½ per cent by the forecast horizon. The profiles of the growth and inflation forecasts had both been revised upwards relative to the time of the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. "], "Financial Markets": [" In the major economies, policy rates were steady but several of the major central banks had continued to expand their balance sheets. Markets were expecting policy rates in these economies to remain at current levels for some time yet. Members noted that the Norwegian central bank had raised its policy rate by 25 basis points during the month. Members also noted that the increase in the cash rate in Australia following the previous Board meeting had been passed through to most housing mortgage rates and to some business lending rates. ", " There had been little change in government bond yields around the world. Spreads on corporate and emerging market sovereign debt were continuing to narrow. Government-guaranteed bond issuance was well below levels earlier this year and some guarantee programs were near their termination dates. ", " Global equity markets had shown some volatility but were broadly unchanged over the month. Earnings reports in the United States market had overall been a little stronger than expected. ", " The Australian bond market was normalising. Issuance by Australian banks had been reasonably strong in October, and for the major banks it was now mostly cheaper to issue unguaranteed debt. Members noted a sizeable offshore unguaranteed issue by a lower-rated bank during the month. Conditions in mortgage-backed securities markets had also continued to improve; there had been two small issues of residential mortgage-backed securities in October. The Australian Office of Financial Management had taken up around 40 per cent of the issues, a considerably smaller proportion than earlier in the year; this indicated further improvement in the securitisation market. ", " In the banking sector, there remained a divergence between the relatively weak performance of many of the large international banks and the Australian banks that had recently reported half-year earnings. Among international banks, there had been a continuation of the pattern of stronger earnings from banks with larger investment banking operations. Commercial banking operations continued to record losses or reduced income, with credit quality remaining poor and write-downs remaining large. In contrast, the Australian banks had reported solid underlying profits and indicated that their loan books were performing better than expected. While measures of asset quality had weakened and expenses for bad and doubtful debts had risen, overall asset quality remained strong by international standards. ", " Members discussed the change in the structure of Australian banks' balance sheets as banks responded to the challenges of the financial market turmoil of the past two years and as the regulatory response became clearer. Strong competition for deposits, partly reflecting a desire by banks to reduce their reliance on short-term capital market funding, had pushed up interest rates on deposits relative to other funding sources. Members considered the possible implications for Australian banks of global proposals for changes to liquidity and capital standards. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had continued to depreciate, unwinding the appreciation seen in the second half of 2008 and early 2009, and in effective terms was only moderately above the lows seen in the first half of 2008. The Chinese renminbi had remained broadly stable against the US dollar over this period, so in effective terms it had appreciated during the worst period of the crisis but had depreciated since early this year. The Australian dollar had tended to strengthen modestly since the previous meeting, and movements in the currency had been highly correlated with movements in global equity markets and investors' risk appetite. ", " Members discussed the results of the March 2009 hedging survey recently published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It confirmed the results of the 2001 and 2005 surveys, showing that the vast majority of the nation's foreign debt was either issued in Australian dollars or hedged into Australian dollars. The survey confirmed that Australian banks' foreign liabilities were almost fully hedged, the exception being some foreign currency borrowing for foreign operations. In aggregate, Australia had a significant net foreign currency asset position, with foreign currency assets exceeding foreign currency liabilities. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Information becoming available over the past month continued to suggest that a recovery in the global economy was under way. Asian economies were generally growing at quite solid rates, after having had sharp contractions in some cases. In the advanced economies conditions remained weak, but activity in most of these had now also begun to grow again. While the recovery in these latter economies was expected to be subdued, the important consideration for the Board was that, for the group of economies that comprise Australia's major trading partners, a broad range of forecasters were expecting growth to be around trend in 2010. ", " Financial markets had seen increased volatility over the past month, but conditions remained much better than had been the case six months earlier. Both debt and equity markets were providing easier, and less costly, access to funds. ", " In the domestic economy, the recent inflation data had been broadly as expected, showing a gradual easing in underlying inflation. Given the earlier period of lower demand growth and the moderation in labour costs, this trend decline in inflation was expected to continue over the coming year, with underlying and CPI inflation expected to be consistent with the target in 2010. Members noted that this represented some further upward revision to forecasts of some months earlier, which had suggested inflation might fall below the target for some time. ", " There had been a relatively limited amount of new data on real activity in the economy; the September labour force data had provided further evidence that the downturn in the labour market had been more moderate than expected earlier in the year. Looking ahead, the outlook was for the growth rate of output to rise gradually to a pace close to trend in 2010. ", " Overall, members considered that the recent information was consistent with the conclusions reached by the Board a month earlier: namely, conditions in the global and Australian economies were significantly better than had been expected earlier in the year when the Board had lowered the cash rate to 3 per cent; the Australian economy was operating with less spare capacity than earlier thought likely; and the growth outlook for the next few years had improved. The Board therefore concluded that it remained prudent, over time, gradually to reduce the degree of monetary accommodation. ", " In considering the pace of that adjustment, members were conscious of balancing risks. On the one hand, business and consumer confidence could prove fragile, and economic activity at home and abroad might slow more than expected as the effects of stimulus measures faded. Also, the rise in the exchange rate would constrain output and dampen inflationary pressure, and credit conditions for some borrowers remained quite difficult. On the other hand, a lengthy period with interest rates at a very low level carried its own risks, particularly once the threat of serious economic weakness had passed. ", " After giving careful consideration to these issues, members judged that it was prudent to take a further step to lessen the degree of monetary stimulus. Looking ahead, members expected that if economic conditions evolved as expected, further gradual adjustment in the cash rate would most likely be appropriate over time, though the pace of the adjustment remained an open question.

In contrast, developments had been more positive for the Chinese economy following some weaker data released the previous month. The election outcome in Greece and announcements regarding recapitalisation of Spanish banks provided some reprieve from mounting fears of a near-term escalation of the crisis in Europe. Nevertheless, members noted that the possibility that the situation in Europe could deteriorate again and spill over to other economies remained a substantial risk. ", " With the recovery in the United States appearing to have lost some momentum, the Federal Reserve had revised down its forecasts for growth. Payroll employment growth had slowed and the unemployment rate had ticked up again. Consumption growth had also slowed, with retail sales only a little higher in recent months and consumer sentiment having fallen in June. A more positive development was that there were further signs of stabilisation in the housing market; house prices were no longer falling and activity was trending up modestly, albeit from historically low levels. ", " Chinese exports continued to grow after softness through most of 2011. Members noted that a number of indicators suggested that growth in domestic activity in China may not be slowing much further, although the outlook remained uncertain. The property market had shown tentative signs of stabilising, with total sales volumes picking up. As inflation had eased further, authorities had shown their willingness to provide some additional support to economic activity, including through reductions in benchmark lending interest rates. ", " Growth in economic activity in the rest of east Asia had been subdued after recovering from the supply disruptions last year. Industrial production had been broadly unchanged since January, and outside of Japan there were signs that growth in domestic demand had slowed a little. Members observed that exports had also been affected by lower demand from Europe and the United States. In Japan, indicators of domestic demand had generally been a little stronger in recent months and concerns about electricity shortages over the summer had been alleviated somewhat by the scheduled re-opening of two nuclear reactors. ", " While commodity prices overall had been broadly unchanged over the past month, earlier declines meant that Australia's terms of trade were estimated to have declined a little further in the June quarter, although they remained at historically high levels. Iron ore prices were little changed over the past month, after falling sharply in May. Reflecting weaker global demand, prices for oil and thermal coal had fallen substantially. In contrast, spot prices for coking coal had increased, in part owing to supply concerns related to industrial action in Australia. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that data released over the past month suggested that the domestic economy had been growing more strongly since the middle of 2011 than had previously been indicated. According to the national accounts, which were released the day after the June Board meeting, GDP grew by 1.3 per cent in the March quarter and by 4.3 per cent over the year, with the annual outcome boosted by the recovery in coal exports following the floods in early 2011. The stronger-than-expected annual outcome also reflected an upward revision to growth in the second half of 2011, to around trend pace. Business investment and consumption both grew faster than expected in the March quarter. However, consumer and business sentiment and other timely indicators of activity suggested that the economy was likely to record slower growth in the June quarter. ", " The divergence between the resource and non-resource economies was apparent in the national accounts and continued to be reflected in business surveys, with conditions in mining and transport well above average, while conditions in construction, retail trade and manufacturing were well below average. Members, however, noted that according to one major business survey, the dispersion of business conditions across industries was well within historical norms. ", " Although survey measures of overall business conditions remained somewhat below average levels, members observed that the pace of business credit had picked up noticeably over the past four months after a long period of weakness. In response to the recent reductions in the cash rate, business lending rates had fallen to below average levels. ", " Household consumption grew strongly over the year to the March quarter, across both goods and services. The strength in goods consumption was somewhat at odds with a range of partial indicators and the Bank's retail liaison over the same period, though more recent liaison had a stronger tone. One possibility discussed by members was that discounting had increased sales volumes but this meant that the growth in the value of sales had been modest. Members were informed that, despite weak consumer sentiment in recent months, recent data suggested that some of the strength in consumption observed earlier in the year had continued into the June quarter. ", " Members noted that household incomes continued to be supported by relatively favourable conditions in the labour market. The unemployment rate remained a little above 5 per cent in May, and the ratio of employment to population had picked up since the beginning of the year. The ABS had recently indicated that it had had difficulties deriving accurate real-time estimates of the working-age population used to calculate employment estimates from the labour force survey. Because of this, the published estimates appeared to be slightly understating employment growth. Forward-looking indicators and liaison implied modest employment growth over coming months. ", " In contrast, indicators suggested that the housing market remained subdued. Dwelling activity was likely to have fallen further in recent months and indicators generally suggested that activity would remain relatively weak in the near term. Notwithstanding an apparent tick-up in June, dwelling prices were around 6 per cent lower than in early 2011, with the largest falls in Melbourne and Brisbane. Household credit continued to grow at around the pace of the past year (broadly in line with incomes). Interest rates on housing loans were around 50 basis points below their 15-year average. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion of financial markets by noting that the resolution of uncertainties surrounding the Greek election and the long-awaited Moody's downgrade of global banks had helped ease some of the recent tensions in financial markets. While the announcement by Spain of a request for support for the banking sector had done little to alleviate concerns about Spain's fiscal problems and the plight of the euro area more generally, the subsequent announcement by European leaders at the end of June about plans to establish a separate pan-European banking supervisor did substantially boost market sentiment, at least for a time. Members noted that the creation of such a supervisor might lead to financing being provided by the European Stability Mechanism directly to European banks, rather than through sovereign governments, and thereby avoid increasing the leverage of individual sovereigns. In response to recent developments, Spanish 10-year government bond yields fell to around 6.4 per cent at the end of June, after having reached a euro-era high of more than 7 per cent during the month. ", " The European developments also caused major equity markets to rise noticeably and government bond yields in the major advanced economies to increase from their historic lows. In Australia, members noted that bond yields had also increased from their historic lows, reflecting both offshore developments as well as stronger domestic economic data. Foreign demand for Australian bonds continued to rise, with foreign investors holding slightly more than three-quarters of Commonwealth Government bonds on issue at the end of March. ", " Corporate bond spreads in the United States and Europe had generally narrowed a little in June, although issuance in Europe had been very low, with little unsecured issuance by banks in particular. Moody's downgraded the ratings of 15 global banks by between one and three notches during the month, with one bank downgraded by three notches. This outcome was, at the margin, a little better than feared and therefore did not have a significant effect on the market. ", " In foreign exchange markets, members noted that, despite the situation in Europe, the euro had appreciated slightly against the US dollar. There had, however, been substantial outflows from the euro to the Swiss franc, particularly in May, which had led the Swiss National Bank to make large purchases of foreign exchange to defend its ceiling of 1.20 Swiss francs to the euro. Similarly, the Japanese authorities had reiterated their willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit upward pressure on the yen. The Australian dollar appreciated over the month, bolstered by positive domestic economic data and further buying of Australian government debt by offshore investors. ", " The difficulties in Europe, together with the run of generally weaker-than-expected global economic data, had led the major central banks to take a number of policy actions over the past month to provide further monetary stimulus. The Federal Reserve had announced a continuation of its Treasury securities purchase program. In China, the People's Bank of China had cut lending rates. The Bank of England, together with the UK Treasury, had announced a plan to provide support to finance for businesses. ", " In Australia, competition for bank deposits remained strong, with the deposit share of bank funding rising a little further to 53 per cent. The rising share of deposits had allowed the Australian banks to continue to be selective about accessing global wholesale funding markets. Bank paper remained well supported in secondary markets and the banks were able to access market funding as required, with reasonable levels of both secured and unsecured issuance over the month. Overall, there had been no sign of dislocation in Australian financial markets. ", " Following the June cash rate announcement, most lenders reduced their standard variable housing rates by around 20 basis points. As a result, the average interest rate on outstanding housing loans was about 60 basis points below the post-1996 average, while rates on small and large business loans were 50 and 75 basis points lower. ", " Members noted that financial markets were pricing in a small probability of a further 25 basis point reduction at the present meeting, with the cash rate now expected to be reduced by less over the rest of the year than had previously been anticipated. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members observed that recent data had pointed to weaker prospects for global growth: exports from east Asia (excluding China) remained flat over the past year; the pace of the recovery had slowed in the United States; and activity in Europe appeared to have declined further in the June quarter. On a more positive note, data for May suggested that growth in the Chinese economy was not slowing to the extent that had been suggested by the weak data for April, and policies had been eased further. Members also noted that markets had viewed the recent announcements by European leaders more favourably. ", " Domestically, members noted that the March quarter national accounts data implied that the economy had had more momentum since mid 2011 than had previously been indicated. Recent data suggested that growth had probably slowed a little from that reported for the first quarter to be around trend pace. Mining investment had been a little stronger than had been expected, and members noted that growth in much of the non-resource economy had remained modest, particularly in those industries under pressure from the high exchange rate and the weakness in the housing sector. The measured strength of consumption growth in the March quarter was at odds with a number of partial indicators for that period, but consumption was being supported by a favourable labour market and recent liaison had a firmer tone. ", " Members noted that indications were that inflationary pressures overall remained contained, notwithstanding the evidence of somewhat stronger economic growth over the past few quarters. In part, this was likely to reflect the still high level of the exchange rate and a softening in global prices, in particular for oil and other commodities. The weak conditions in parts of the economy for most of the past year – such as retailing and housing – also appeared to have played a role. Members observed that there was also tentative evidence that productivity growth had picked up over this period. ", " Members continued to view it as appropriate for interest rates to be a little below average given evidence of slower global growth and the low rate of inflation in Australia. But with a material easing in monetary policy having occurred over the preceding six months or so, and with recent signs that the domestic economy had a little more momentum than had earlier been indicated, members saw no need for any further adjustment to the cash rate at this meeting.

Members noted that weaker-than-expected economic data, particularly for China, had also weighed on sentiment. ", " The inconclusive parliamentary elections in Greece and the public backlash against austerity measures there had increased public discussion about Greece's possible exit from the euro area. A critical issue if Greece were to exit would be the ability of the European authorities to limit the contagion to other euro area countries. In the case of Spain, members observed that there had been increased concerns about the sustainability of the country's fiscal position, with one of the largest banks having to be recapitalised by the Spanish Government. That task had complicated Spain's efforts to reassure financial markets that it could contain the problems in its banking system while strengthening public finances. As a result, Spanish bond yields had risen back to the highs recorded in the second half of 2011. ", " Reflecting the increased risk aversion across global financial markets, government bond yields in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom fell markedly, with 10-year bond yields reaching historic lows during the month. In Australia, 10-year government bond yields also declined to a historical low level, below 3 per cent, with the spread to US government bond yields narrowing significantly. Yields on Australian state debt fell to historical low levels as well, despite spreads to Australian government debt widening further over the month. ", " Members noted that there were also widespread falls in equity prices across the major markets, with share price indices down by between 5 and 10 per cent over the month. Australian share prices fell broadly in line with overseas markets; resources stocks, in particular, declined with lower commodity prices and concerns over Chinese growth. ", " The Australian dollar had depreciated by around 5 per cent since the previous Board meeting – in contrast to the resilience it had displayed in the period of heightened risk aversion earlier in the year. European, emerging market and other commodity currencies had also depreciated against the US dollar, and by more against the Japanese yen. The renminbi had also depreciated slightly against the US dollar but, given the movement in the US dollar over the month, had appreciated in trade-weighted terms. ", " Notwithstanding the general widening in corporate bond spreads in Europe and the United States, there had been little sign of dislocation in Australian credit markets. There had been solid issuance in the asset-backed securities markets by both large and small banks. The major banks continued to access overseas markets, though they did not have to raise significant volumes given the large amount of funding that occurred in the March quarter and the modest growth in credit. Members noted that, as has been the case for the past couple of years, the Australian banks were using new bond issuance only to cover maturities and were funding credit growth through deposits. ", " Short-term interest rates in Australia had fallen sharply following the Board's decision in early May to lower the cash rate by 50 basis points. Following the cash rate announcement, most lenders had reduced their standard variable housing rates by between 30 and 40 basis points. As a result, the average interest rate on outstanding housing loans at present was about 40 basis points below the post-1996 average, while rates on small and large business loans were 30 and 60 basis points lower, respectively. Members discussed the strong competition among banks for term deposits and the continuing pressure this was having on the funding costs for Australian banks. ", " Renewed pessimism about Europe and weaker economic data in other major countries had led to expectations of further declines in the Australian cash rate, with the market pricing in a reduction of at least 25 basis points at the current meeting, as well as further sizeable reductions over the balance of the year. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The international news over the past month was dominated by developments in Europe, particularly in Greece. As attention also shifted to the sustainability of Spain's fiscal position, European leaders were trying to develop a comprehensive policy response to the crisis, with Germany still reluctant to contemplate significant adjustments to the existing approach. Members observed that the growing tensions were occurring in the context of ongoing weakness in economic activity in the region, although the recently released economic data mostly pre-dated the latest developments. Euro area GDP was flat in the March quarter, with a rise in German GDP offset by falls in many other countries; the euro area PMIs declined significantly in both April and May; and unemployment rates outside of Germany had generally continued to rise, remaining well over 20 per cent in Greece and Spain. ", " Recent indicators suggested that the pace of recovery in the United States had eased slightly. March quarter GDP increased by 0.5 per cent, with modest growth in household consumption and a decline in public demand, while forward indicators of investment were somewhat weaker over recent months. There had been some slowing in the rate of employment growth and little change in the unemployment rate. In the housing market, there were signs that both activity and prices had improved, albeit from a low base. The outlook for the US economy remained clouded by the large fiscal consolidation that would start from next year unless Congress amended existing legislation. ", " Outside of China, economic activity in east Asia had strengthened in the early part of 2012 following the recovery from the natural disasters in 2011, but it remained difficult to gauge the ongoing pace of expansion. Recent indicators had suggested a pause in the recovery in Japan. The Indian economy had continued to expand at a moderate pace, though with weakness evident in the services and exports sectors and in the outlook for investment. ", " In China, the recent data indicated that the pace of growth had slowed a little further, which had prompted an easing in financial and fiscal policies. Industrial production in April was weaker than expected, controls on the property sector were weighing on construction activity somewhat and manufacturing PMIs fell in May. Even so, retail spending remained resilient. Exports to Europe – China's largest trading partner – continued to weaken in April, although the trend in exports to other destinations remained positive. In response, with inflation pressures having abated, the authorities there had taken measures to support demand: reserve requirement ratios were lowered by 50 basis points (for the third time since December), additional subsidies for household consumption were announced, and the Government appeared to be preparing to boost infrastructure investment. Members noted that there was some scope for an easing of China's fiscal and financial policies to ensure that growth did not slow much further over the near term. However, given the experience following the large fiscal expansion announced in late 2008 – in terms of the resulting housing boom and inflationary pressures more generally – the authorities were likely to ease policies in a more measured way than was the case in the earlier episode. ", " The softening in global activity had been associated with a general decline in commodity prices. Spot prices for iron ore, thermal coal and crude oil declined significantly over the month. While part of the fall in iron ore prices reflected an easing in earlier supply disruptions in Australia and Brazil, economic weakness in Europe and an easing in Chinese steel prices had raised concerns about near-term demand. Coking coal prices were a little higher in the month after falling earlier in the year. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that indicators of recent economic activity had been mixed but, on balance, suggested continued moderate growth. Taking the past two months together, ABS data suggested a pick-up in the growth rate of retail sales; nominal retail sales declined by 0.2 per cent in April, but this had followed a strong rise of 1.1 per cent in March. Consumer confidence rose slightly in May, but remained below its long-run average level. In aggregate, housing prices continued to decline and activity in the housing market remained weak, with a sharp fall in dwelling approvals in April partly accentuated by the introduction of new legislative guidelines in Western Australia. ", " Surveys of business conditions generally fell in April, to average or below-average levels. Much of the reported strength in business conditions continued to be in mining-related and transport industries, with the weakness concentrated in the retail, construction and manufacturing industries. Members were briefed on the March quarter capital expenditure survey, which suggested a continuation of the very large pipeline of committed mining investment in coming years, notwithstanding recent announcements by some mining companies that they were re-considering the viability of a number of resource projects to which they had not yet committed. The data also showed that non-mining investment intentions remained weak. The pace of business credit had been increasing gradually to an annualised rate of around 4 per cent over the six months to April. ", " Some modest strengthening in the labour market over the year to date was apparent, as employment increased by 15,000 in April, the unemployment rate declined to below 5 per cent and the trend measure of average hours worked edged up. However, other indicators and information from liaison continued to suggest that hiring intentions outside mining-related activities remained relatively subdued. ", " Recent data indicated that private wage growth had been relatively steady in the past few quarters. The wage price index for the private sector increased by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter, to be 3.7 per cent higher over the year; growth of public-sector wages slowed a little in the quarter and was running at 3.1 per cent in year-ended terms. In line with differences in labour market conditions across the country, the pace of private-sector wage growth had picked up across a broad range of industries in Western Australia, although, relative to other states, the difference in the rate of growth of wages was less marked than it had been in 2007–2008. Fair Work Australia's annual wage review announced a 2.9 per cent increase in the minimum wage and award wages. ", " The underlying cash balance of the Australian Government Budget was expected to shift from a deficit of 3 per cent of GDP in 2011/12 to a surplus of 0.1 per cent of GDP in 2012/13. However, various publicly available estimates suggested that the direct impact of the fiscal consolidation on the economy was likely to be considerably less than the headline figures implied. In part, this reflected a shift in the timing of some payments into the current financial year from 2012/13 and, to a lesser extent, the nature of expenditure patterns, including cuts in spending offshore. A range of estimates suggested that the budget may subtract around ¾–1½ per cent from growth in real GDP, before allowing for any offsetting factors. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members observed that developments in the euro area over the past month had increased the probability of a sharp deterioration in economic conditions in response to ongoing concerns about the sustainability of sovereign debt obligations and stability of banking systems in the periphery of the region. More generally, information received over the past month suggested some weakening in the global outlook in the near term. In addition to indicators of weaker economic activity in Europe, data from China suggested a further slowing in growth, although the Chinese authorities had responded by easing financial and fiscal policies. The recovery in the United States was proceeding, but at a moderate pace. Weaker global prospects had led to lower commodity prices, which, combined with a reduction in the global appetite for risk, had led to a depreciation of the Australian dollar. Members noted, however, that the deterioration in financial market conditions globally had, to date, not led to a noticeable tightening in the cost or availability of funds in Australia. ", " Domestically, recent indicators of economic activity had been mixed. Data on retail sales, the labour market, mining investment and business credit were consistent with a degree of resilience in the domestic economy, while business confidence had weakened in non-mining sectors, along with indicators of activity in the construction industry. Overall, data on the domestic economy appeared to be broadly consistent with the Bank's most recent forecasts. In particular, employment growth was picking up gradually, but the unemployment rate was still expected to move somewhat higher over the coming quarters. Output growth was expected to increase towards trend over the remainder of this year, and inflation (excluding the impact of the carbon tax) was expected to remain in the lower part of the 2–3 per cent range. ", " The Board considered whether the recent information warranted a further reduction in the cash rate. ", " The arguments were finely balanced. Recent domestic data generally had not suggested a significant weakening in conditions compared with the forecasts a month earlier. Moreover, there had not been time to assess the effects of the earlier reductions in the cash rate. However, there was clear evidence suggesting a softening in global conditions, and uncertainty about the future in Europe had increased significantly. While spillovers had been limited thus far, there was a reasonable likelihood that the tendency toward precautionary behaviour both abroad and at home would intensify. Given this, and with inflation expected to remain in the lower part of the targeting range over the next year or so, members considered that there was scope for monetary policy to be a little more supportive of domestic activity. Members judged that a reduction in the cash rate of 25 basis points, combined with the earlier reductions, would mean that monetary policy would be providing a measure of stimulus that would be expected to flow through to the domestic economy over the coming months. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent, effective 6 June. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 7 August 2012"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury), John Akehurst, Jillian Broadbent AO, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Heather Ridout, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Jonathan Kearns (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that escalating concerns regarding the fiscal and banking problems facing the euro area had weighed on confidence in many economies, and economic activity appeared to have slowed further in Europe. At the same time, growth in the United States and parts of Asia had slowed, while in China indicators generally pointed to growth stabilising. Financial markets remained volatile and the risks emanating from Europe continued to affect the outlook. ", " Members were briefed that the IMF had recently released forecasts for global growth of 3.5 per cent in 2012 and 3.9 per cent in 2013, marginally lower than the forecasts released in April. The forecast for growth in Australia's trading partners had also been revised lower, but remained almost 1 percentage point higher than the forecast for global growth, reflecting the larger share of trade with emerging market economies in Asia. The IMF continued to see the balance of risks to the global economy as skewed to the downside. ", " Members observed that there were signs that growth in the Chinese economy appeared to be stabilising at a more sustainable pace. Real GDP grew by 1.8 per cent in the June quarter, slightly faster than the March quarter, to be 7.6 per cent higher over the year. Earlier tight monetary conditions, property market restrictions and a normalisation of fiscal policies had led to a slowing in Chinese domestic demand. While total exports had continued to grow, exports to Europe had been weaker. Nevertheless, there were signs that investment growth had steadied and some early indications that conditions in the housing market had also improved a little in recent months. Meanwhile, real household consumption growth had remained broadly stable over the past few years. ", " In contrast to China, conditions were weaker in the rest of east Asia, with industrial production and exports broadly flat over the past year. Members noted that, with growth in demand having slowed in much of the region, inflationary pressures had eased across Asia. The Chinese authorities had adjusted monetary conditions to a more accommodative stance; there was scope for easier policies elsewhere and some countries had started down that path. ", " Growth in the United States slowed a little in the June quarter, and measures of household and business confidence remained at low levels in July. Employment and consumption growth had been slower in recent months than earlier in the year, and growth in business investment remained subdued. In contrast, the outlook for construction appeared to be marginally better, with activity and prices in the housing market starting to recover, albeit from very low levels. Nonetheless, members recognised that there remained large overhangs of household debt and properties for sale or in foreclosure in the housing market. ", " In Europe, timely indicators suggested that economic activity had contracted in the June quarter, with declines in both consumption and investment. Labour markets remained very weak, particularly in the crisis economies, where unemployment had risen further from already high rates. Measures of confidence had weakened further across most euro area economies recently. While the competitiveness of the crisis economies had been improving, members noted that further significant economic adjustment seemed necessary and the challenges ahead for the euro area remained substantial. ", " Commodity price movements had been mixed over the past month. Spot prices for iron ore and coking coal had declined recently, consistent with a softening in global demand and rising supply. However, prices for oil and some rural commodities had increased over the past month because of supply disruptions, with drought in the US and Black Sea cropping regions affecting the supply of grains in particular. In the June quarter, the terms of trade were estimated to have declined, though they remained at a high level. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Inflation in the June quarter was broadly in line with expectations, with the various measures showing underlying inflation of around ½ per cent in the quarter, and 2 per cent over the year, which was the lowest annual rate since the late 1990s. The CPI rose by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, to be 1.2 per cent higher over the year. The quarterly outcome reflected strength in rents and a rebound in the prices of fruit and vegetables. Measured on an annual basis, inflation was held down by earlier large falls in the prices of fruit and vegetables. Domestic inflationary pressures eased a little in the first half of 2012, with broad-based disinflation across non-traded goods, such as food and new dwellings, and a range of market-based services, notably domestic travel and accommodation. Following substantial declines over recent years, tradables prices rose in the quarter, with stronger outcomes for cars, clothing, footwear and some household goods. More generally, the outcome for tradables prices suggested that the significant downward pressure on inflation from the earlier exchange rate appreciation was lessening. ", " Members noted that the domestic economy appeared to be growing at around trend pace in the June quarter, though activity continued to vary significantly across industries. Resource investment, which continued to evolve broadly in line with the Bank's forecasts, spurred activity in a number of industries, while the high Australian dollar and weak conditions in the housing market had weighed on activity in a number of non-resource industries. ", " Members were informed that additional large resource projects had commenced or received approval in recent months, thereby sustaining the very large stock of work in the pipeline. This had occurred despite some mining companies adopting a more cautious approach to potential, but yet to be approved, investment projects. Coal exports had declined in the June quarter following industrial disputes and weather-related disruptions, while iron ore exports had recovered from cyclone-related disruptions earlier in the year. ", " Investment in non-resource industries generally remained subdued, with firms slowing their investment spending in line with weaker cash flows. Nevertheless, following a period of deleveraging, business credit had picked up over the past few quarters to be growing at its fastest pace in three and a half years. ", " Members also observed that there were indications that consumer spending had retained some momentum in the June quarter, even though consumer sentiment remained at subdued levels. Growth in the volume of retail sales remained above its pace in late 2011, sales of motor vehicles to households increased strongly, and the number of Australians travelling overseas continued to increase. Information from the Bank's retail liaison suggested that various government payments made to households through May and June had had a noticeable effect on sales at some retailers. ", " Members noted that there were tentative signs that housing market conditions and residential building activity were starting to pick up after being weak for some time. Prices had increased a little in recent months, but remained somewhat lower than a year ago. Demand for housing finance was broadly unchanged over the year. With building approvals rising from low levels, the outlook for residential construction activity was more positive for the second half of the year. Earlier falls in interest rates and rising rental yields were likely to have increased the attractiveness of housing investment. ", " Employment growth picked up somewhat in the June quarter and there had been little change in the unemployment rate, which remained around 5¼ per cent. Members also noted that the dispersion of unemployment rates across regions remained relatively low. Employment growth continued to reflect the net effect of strong growth in resource, resource-related, health and education industries, and structural developments that had created pressure for labour shedding in some non-resource industries, including retail trade, manufacturing and construction. Leading indicators continued to suggest modest growth in employment in the period ahead; measures of vacancies and job advertisements had declined over recent quarters, but remained at relatively high levels. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. While the stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the March quarter boosted forecast growth over 2012 to 3½ per cent, employment growth in the near term was expected to remain relatively modest. The economy was then expected to grow at around 3 per cent over 2013 and 2014, largely unchanged from the forecasts presented in May. Resource investment was forecast to peak during 2013/14 and gradually decline over subsequent years, although the timing of the peak was uncertain, with the boost to growth coming from higher resource exports and a gradual rise in non-resource investment. ", " Members observed that the outlook for inflation was little changed. Reflecting the waning disinflationary impact of the earlier exchange rate appreciation and the introduction of the carbon price, the staff forecast was for underlying inflation to pick up gradually to the top half of the target range by mid 2013. The carbon price effect on year-ended inflation was forecast largely to have passed by late 2013, with underlying inflation forecast to decline a little to around the middle of the target range thereafter. Headline CPI inflation was forecast to rise to around 3 per cent by mid 2013 as a result of the passing of the earlier volatility in fruit prices and the introduction of the carbon price, before returning to around the middle of the target range over the remainder of the forecast period. "], "Financial Markets": [" Developments in Europe continued to dominate financial market sentiment over the past month. Initially, the measures agreed upon at the euro summit in late June appeared to bring some stability to financial markets, but this proved to be short lived as developments in Spain and Greece again weighed heavily on European debt markets. ", " Members noted that yields on long-term Spanish government bonds reached a new euro-era high of over 7½ per cent during July, while shorter-term bond yields also increased sharply. Subsequent statements by European Central Bank (ECB) President Draghi that the ECB would do ‘whatever it takes’ to preserve the euro and that the ECB was considering direct purchases of short-term sovereign debt saw a marked decline in Spanish short-term yields in the days prior to the Board meeting and 10-year bond yields fell back below 7 per cent. ", " While Spain retained bond market access – issuing €6 billion of bonds in July – the Spanish authorities had acknowledged that Spain could not fund itself at current yields for an extended period. Members noted that foreign investors had markedly reduced their holdings of both Spanish and Italian sovereign debt over the past year. ", " Earlier in July, the deteriorating economic situation in Europe had led the ECB to lower its policy rates further. The decision to reduce the rate paid on its deposit facility to zero meant that an increasing number of money market rates within the euro area had become negative, which accentuated the desire to shift funds out of the euro, thereby triggering a further depreciation of the euro. It had also led several euro-denominated money market funds to announce their closure to new investments. In this context, members discussed the increasing difficulties that pension funds in the major economies were facing in the environment of extremely low – in some cases negative – interest rates. ", " A number of other central banks, including the People's Bank of China, also eased monetary policy in July. The US Federal Reserve did not take any action at its meeting in early August, but indicated that further measures would be forthcoming unless economic conditions in the United States improved. ", " Within this environment, bond yields plumbed new historic lows for many of the major sovereign issuers during July. The decline in yields on Commonwealth Government securities was particularly pronounced, with the 10-year yield briefly falling to a historic low just below 2.7 per cent. Offshore purchases of Australian government bonds appeared to have continued apace and, in part reflecting these purchases, the Australian dollar had appreciated over the past month, increasing through periods of both strength and weakness in ‘risk-sensitive’ assets. Members noted that this had put the trade-weighted measure of the currency back near its post-float high, notwithstanding the decline in the terms of trade and the weaker global outlook. ", " The further decline in the euro exchange rate put additional pressure on the Swiss National Bank in maintaining the franc's peg against the euro to avert deflationary pressures. Members noted that the Swiss National Bank had purchased around €100 billion over May and June, with further sizeable purchases likely to have occurred in July. While some of these purchases were retained in euros, a sizeable share was converted into other currencies, including a modest amount in the Australian dollar. In contrast, members noted that the level of Chinese foreign reserves fell in the June quarter, as capital outflows occurred. ", " Share prices globally had been volatile but buoyed late in the month by the prospect of more forceful policy measures by the ECB. A notable exception was the Chinese stock market, which continued its decline from earlier in the year. While banking shares had performed poorly in European and US markets, amid investigations into the fixing of benchmark interbank rates, these declines were largely reversed following the comments by ECB President Draghi. In contrast, the share prices of Australian banks had generally been firmer during the past month. ", " While global debt market activity was reasonably subdued during July, Australian banks accessed both onshore and offshore term funding in sizeable volume and at spreads little changed from earlier in the year. Domestically, the banks continued to focus on generating additional deposits to fund lending growth, resulting in spreads paid on deposits relative to wholesale benchmark rates remaining elevated. Members noted that Australian banks' net exposures to LIBOR were low, as positions priced off these reference rates were largely offsetting. The market convention in Australia is to reference most financial products against the domestic bank bill swap reference rate. ", " The improvement in sentiment after President Draghi's announcement had seen money market participants in Australia curtail their expectation of further cuts in the cash rate target. Current market pricing did not indicate any expectation of a change in monetary policy at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The global economic environment remained fragile, with the uncertainty emanating from the euro area affecting financial markets and potentially delaying spending by firms and households. The latest forecasts for global growth had been revised down a little, reflecting further deterioration in Europe and slower growth in the United States and parts of Asia. Economic developments in China, however, had been a little more positive, with tentative signs that growth was stabilising at a more sustainable pace. The forecast for global growth in 2012 was close to its long-term average and growth was expected to pick up somewhat in 2013. Nevertheless, the risk of significant economic and financial disruption in the euro area continued to cloud the outlook. ", " Domestically, the economy was forecast to grow around trend pace over the medium term. Resource investment was projected to continue to increase rapidly over the next year or so, broadly in line with earlier expectations. The eventual decline in resource investment was expected to be roughly offset, in the forecasts, by a ramp-up in resource exports as projects were completed, and a gradual strengthening in some parts of the non-resource economy that had been relatively weak. Members noted that there was a good deal of uncertainty surrounding the forecast timing of these shifts. ", " Domestic financial conditions had eased in recent months as a result of the earlier reductions in the cash rate, which had seen borrowing rates fall a little below their medium-term averages. While the full effects would take some time yet to become apparent, there were tentative signs of an effect on the housing market. There had also been a noticeable pick-up in business credit growth over recent months. Consumption growth had strengthened, though this probably reflected, in part, the government payments made over recent months. At the same time, however, the exchange rate had remained at a relatively high level, notwithstanding the weakening in the global outlook and decline in many commodity prices. ", " The inflation data for the June quarter were broadly in line with expectations, and confirmed that underlying inflation was around the bottom of the target. This reflected the lagged effects of the earlier appreciation of the exchange rate and weakness in demand in some parts of the non-resource economy, which had seen inflation of non-tradable prices ease in the first half of 2012 to its average over the inflation-targeting period. Inflation was forecast to increase a little as the effects of the earlier exchange rate appreciation continued to wane, and it would also temporarily be pushed higher by the introduction of the carbon price. Inflation was nonetheless forecast to be around the middle of the target range by late 2013 and to be consistent with the target over the medium term. ", " With inflation expected to be consistent with the target and growth close to trend, but with a more subdued international outlook than was the case a few months ago, the Board judged that the stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.

The indicators for economic activity in China were a little softer overall, after having appeared somewhat more positive in the previous month, while economic activity in the rest of Asia and the United States appeared to have expanded at a modest pace. Economic conditions remained weak in Europe. Against this background, there had been sharp falls in the prices of iron ore and coking coal more recently. ", " Members observed that data on economic activity in China had been a bit weaker of late. The manufacturing PMI fell back in August and the value of exports over the year to July was broadly flat. In July, consumption indicators remained quite strong in real terms and the growth of industrial production was steady, as the slowing in demand for materials for property construction, particularly for residential construction, had been offset by the ongoing expansion in infrastructure and manufacturing investment. Inflation had continued to decline, to be less than 2 per cent over the year to July. ", " Activity in the rest of Asia, including Japan, had softened, as weaker conditions in China and major developed countries had weighed on exports from the region, especially from the higher-income Asian economies. In India, the fact that inflation remained high in the face of a declining pace of economic growth might reflect structural impediments to growth. ", " In the United States, after slightly slower GDP growth in the June quarter, recent data had been more positive. Retail sales and payrolls employment picked up in July, and the housing market was improving gradually, albeit off a very low base. In contrast, economic activity in the euro area contracted further in the June quarter – and quite sharply in the southern European crisis economies – while more timely indicators suggested that conditions across the region remained very weak. ", " Members observed that spot prices for iron ore and coking coal had fallen sharply of late, largely reflecting weakness in China's steel market as well as an easing in a range of factors that had temporarily disrupted the supply of coking coal. Since mid June, iron ore spot prices had fallen by a little over 35 per cent and coking coal prices had fallen by almost 25 per cent. Members noted that these price falls were likely to be reflected relatively quickly in export prices, as an increasing share of iron ore was traded in the spot market and on short-term contracts over recent years. Overall, other commodity prices had been relatively flat over the past few months. The RBA index of commodity prices had declined by 7 per cent over the previous month (on the basis of spot price movements). "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The June quarter national accounts data, scheduled to be released the day after the Board meeting, were expected to show the pace of output growth had been around trend, following strong growth in the March quarter. ", " Partial indicators suggested that consumption growth remained relatively strong in the June quarter, helped by government assistance payments to households, though members noted that some parts of the retail sector were facing quite challenging conditions. Retail spending had fallen in July, although liaison suggested that spending had picked up in August. Measures of consumer sentiment remained close to their long‑run average levels. ", " Conditions in the housing sector were subdued, but there were tentative signs of an improvement. Building approvals had increased strongly in the June quarter, and fell back in July, but remained a little higher than earlier in the year. Loan approvals for new dwellings and first-home owner grants had also risen in recent months. Dwelling prices had increased slightly over the previous three months in Sydney and Melbourne and were broadly unchanged in other cities, with turnover remaining low. ", " Members noted that the large Australian producers of iron ore had achieved record levels of production in the first half of the year, and production was expected to increase further over the coming year. Thermal coal shipments increased sharply from New South Wales in July as new capacity came on line, while temporary factors had weighed on exports of coking coal from Queensland, though there were reports of a slowing in demand as well. ", " After a surge in mining investment in the March quarter, growth in business investment was estimated to have moderated in the June quarter. However, the latest ABS capital expenditure survey, which was conducted in July and August, suggested that the outlook for investment over the current financial year remained very strong, notwithstanding a more recent reassessment by some resource companies of the prospects for projects to which they had not yet committed. If the fall in the iron ore and coking coal prices were to be sustained, it could lead to somewhat lower mining investment, but given the large LNG and other mining investment projects already under way, the staff still expected there to be a substantial increase in resource investment over the next year or so. ", " Members were informed that investment outside the mining sector, which had been subdued up to the June quarter, was expected to remain subdued during the current financial year. In line with this, survey measures of business conditions had eased a little in July and remained below average. At the same time, however, business credit had picked up during 2012 and was growing at its fastest pace in over three years. ", " Employment in July continued to expand at around the same pace as that of the working-age population and the unemployment rate had remained steady at 5¼ per cent. Members noted that the number of unemployment benefit recipients had increased. Leading indicators of labour demand had softened a little further, though they were consistent with modest employment growth over coming months. ", " Members observed that the pace of wage growth increased a little in the June quarter after having eased slightly in the March quarter. The wage price index increased by 1.0 per cent in the quarter to be 3.7 per cent higher over the year. Wage growth was strongest for skilled professions and for workers in Western Australia more broadly. Growth was moderate in industries more directly exposed to household consumption expenditure. ", " There was little new information on prices over the past month. Liaison suggested that the introduction of the carbon price had not yet had a significant effect on downstream price pressures, with only isolated examples of suppliers attributing price increases to the carbon price. There was no evidence that the carbon price had raised medium-term inflation expectations. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion of financial markets with the observation that the improved sentiment in global markets over August had largely reflected growing expectations that the European Central Bank (ECB) would announce significant policy measures following its meeting on 6 September. Uncertainty about those measures, as well as about several other upcoming decisions in Europe and the United States, had contributed to low turnover in most financial markets. In particular, the German Constitutional Court was due to rule on the legality of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) on 12 September, on which date the Netherlands would also hold national elections, while the follow-up audits of Spanish banks and the next review of Greece by the troika of official agencies (ECB, European Commission and International Monetary Fund) were also in prospect. Members noted that market pricing embodied expectations of further concrete action from policymakers. ", " Members were briefed about the ECB's concern that the large risk premia in some European bond yields, reflecting the possibility of a euro area break-up, were hampering the transmission of its monetary policy. Given this concern, the ECB had indicated the possibility of purchasing shorter-term sovereign debt to reduce yields, but only if the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and ESM also purchased sovereign debt issued by these governments (which would entail some conditionality). As a result, Spanish and Italian bond yields of shorter maturity had declined significantly. At the same time, yields on debt issued by many of the major sovereigns remained at historically low levels, as did those on government bonds in Australia. ", " Equity markets generally rose in August, although turnover was very low, as had been the case in most other financial markets. Members noted that the US share market had recovered to around the levels it reached in early 2012, to be around 10 per cent below its pre-crisis peak of late 2007. In contrast, the Chinese equity market had declined further, to be at its lowest level in more than three years. ", " Activity in foreign exchange markets was also subdued in August, with the euro appreciating modestly. While the Australian dollar depreciated slightly over the past month, it remained near its recent highs, despite significant falls in some commodity prices and a weaker outlook for the global economy. Members noted that most model-based estimates of the currency generally placed a large weight on the terms of trade. With the terms of trade still high by historical standards, these models suggested that the Australian dollar may have been somewhat overvalued, but not substantially so, although members also noted the significant uncertainty that surrounded this assessment. ", " Members noted the sizeable corporate issuance over the past month, particularly in the United States, which in part had reflected investors seeking yield given the extremely low rates on offer from sovereign debt. Australian banks had continued to have ready access to wholesale markets, including offshore wholesale markets. Banks' term deposit rates were a little lower but remained elevated, while there was little change in banks' lending rates over the month. ", " The Board's decision to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 3.50 per cent in early August had been widely anticipated, with money market yields little changed at that time and over the rest of the month. Members observed that market pricing suggested that no change in the cash rate was likely at the September meeting, but that the cash rate was expected to be reduced to around 3 per cent by the end of 2012. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " Overall, risks to global financial stability remained elevated, mainly reflecting the ongoing economic and financial problems in Europe. Although fears of a liquidity crisis in the euro area had eased earlier in the year following the ECB's large-scale lending to banks, concerns about the resilience of sovereign and bank balance sheets in the euro area persisted. Outside the euro area, the major banking systems had generally continued on a slow path to recovery in recent quarters, while the Australian banking system remained in a relatively strong position. ", " Members noted developments in several broad indicators for banks, including share prices, profits and indicators of asset quality, which reflected these general themes. Bank share price indices in countries such as Canada and Australia had performed more strongly in recent years than those in the United States and United Kingdom, which in turn had outperformed those in the euro area by a clear margin. While asset quality measures had generally improved outside the euro area, the underlying profitability of the major banking systems in countries such as the United States remained subdued, and it was only in a few advanced economies (including Canada and Australia) where large banks continued to earn returns on equity close to pre-crisis levels. ", " In general, the Australian banking system remained well placed to service the needs of the Australian economy. Members noted that pressures in wholesale funding markets had eased since late last year and the large banks had further reduced their use of offshore wholesale funding as growth in deposits continued to outpace growth in credit. While the Australian banks remained exposed to swings in global financial market sentiment associated with the problems in Europe, the changes in their funding, liquidity and capital positions over recent years suggested their resilience to these swings had improved. ", " Members were briefed on trends in Australian banks' asset performance. The ratio of non-performing loans had continued to decline, though the improvement was only gradual, reflecting the difficult conditions being experienced in some parts of the business sector. Banks' bad and doubtful debt charges had declined more substantially since the peak of the crisis period but now appeared to have troughed, and this had contributed – along with higher funding costs and lower credit growth – to a slower rate of profit growth in recent reporting periods. This had prompted a renewed focus on cost containment but, at this stage, it had not spurred an undue increase in risk-taking by banks. ", " Members noted that the household and business sectors in Australia had continued to display a relatively prudent approach towards their finances in recent quarters. Many households continued to prefer saving and paying down existing debts more quickly than required, which had contributed to household credit growth being more in line with income growth in recent years. While there remained some isolated pockets of weakness, aggregate measures of financial stress were relatively low. ", " For the Australian business sector, a period of deleveraging had been followed by a pick-up in business borrowing, although businesses' overall recourse to external funding remained below historical averages. While the uneven conditions in the business sector had contributed to the weaker performance of banks' loan portfolios in recent years, business balance sheets were in good shape overall and profitability remained solid. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Information that became available over the past month pointed to slightly softer conditions in many parts of the global economy. Ongoing weakness in the advanced economies appeared to be weighing on exports from Asia, although a number of indicators of activity for the US economy were a little more positive over the past month. A month earlier, members had noted that there were some tentative signs that Chinese growth might be stabilising at a more sustainable pace. However, the most recent data had been a touch weaker, and this had been accompanied by a sharp decline in spot prices for iron ore and coking coal. If sustained, this decline would imply a larger fall in the terms of trade than the staff had earlier forecast, though the terms of trade would still remain high by historical standards. ", " The staff forecasts had been for resource investment to peak some time in 2013/14, at around 9 per cent of GDP. Recent announcements curtailing projects were likely to have only a small effect on the expected profile for mining investment in the near term. However, members observed that concerns about current high costs and a softening in commodity prices may have implications for resource projects still under consideration. ", " The Australian dollar had depreciated slightly over the past month, but remained close to its post-float high. Members discussed the possibility that the high level of the exchange rate was weighing more heavily on the economy than might be expected. Overall, despite the ongoing structural change, the unemployment rate had remained relatively low to date. ", " The main news on inflation over the past month had been that wage growth had picked up a little in the June quarter. The pace of growth varied somewhat across industries and regions, and was higher for those more closely connected to the resource investment boom. The Bank's forecasts for inflation had been based on domestic costs remaining contained, through some moderation in wages, ongoing downward pressure on margins and a sustained improvement in productivity growth. ", " Since the last change to monetary policy in June, the Board had concluded that the stance of monetary policy resulting in interest rates being a bit below average was appropriate, given low inflation and the weaker outlook for growth globally. Developments since the previous Board meeting suggested that the global economy remained subject to significant downside risks. Of particular note this month was the recent sharp decline in some bulk commodity prices. At the same time, though, the domestic economy appeared to be growing at around trend pace and there were signs that the effects of earlier reductions in the cash rate were still working their way through the domestic economy. ", " The current assessment of the inflation outlook continued to provide scope to adjust policy in response to any significant deterioration in the outlook for growth. At this meeting, the Board judged that, with inflation expected to be consistent with the target and growth close to trend, but with a more subdued international outlook than was the case a few months ago, the stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.

", " Members congratulated Mr Kraehe on his appointment to the Board and welcomed him to his first meeting. "], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": [" Given that developments in financial markets had dominated the economic news over the past month, the Governor suggested that the Board begin its discussions by looking at those developments. ", " The key point was that there had been a substantial amount of volatility in financial markets during the month. This had followed a long period of low volatility, which had been interrupted only during the May–June period of 2006 when markets reacted to fears of rising inflation. The source of the volatility in recent weeks was different and, while not entirely clear, it appeared to be related to three developments: the fall in the Chinese share market; concerns about the US sub-prime mortgage market; and the recent movements in the yen. ", " The fall in the Chinese share market could not be traced to any particular event, though it may have reflected concerns about measures, such as a capital gains tax, the authorities were contemplating to curb speculative excesses in asset markets. The fall quickly spread to other markets and the associated increase in risk aversion in global financial markets had persisted since then. Members noted that the fall of 15 per cent in the Chinese market over the past month needed to be seen in the context of a rise of 135 per cent over the course of 2006. The fall in Chinese share prices was the trigger for downward moves in share markets around the world: over the subsequent week, markets were 9 per cent lower in Japan, 7 per cent lower in Europe, 5 per cent lower in the US and 6½ per cent lower in Australia. Emerging markets experienced larger falls, in some cases of over 10 per cent. ", " Bond spreads in Asia widened as a result of investors' increasing risk aversion, though these remained at relatively low levels. US 10-year bond yields declined by around 25 basis points to 4½ per cent in reaction to weaker US economic data and the fall in the Chinese share market. Bond yields in the euro area declined by less than in the US, given the relatively stronger economic conditions. Japanese yields also fell only slightly. Yields in Australia moved closely with those in the US and there was no change in the differential. ", " Market participants now expected short-term interest rates in the US to fall later in the year, whereas no change in monetary policy had been expected previously. An increase in short-term rates in the euro area was expected to be announced by the ECB in the days following the Board meeting, with a further increase in the next six months. ", " There had been a strong appreciation of the yen in February. This seemed to be due to some unwinding of the carry trade as a result of rising aversion to risk among investors following the financial market volatility emanating from China. ", " Board members spent some time discussing developments in the US mortgage market. It was noted that the sub-prime (or lower quality) part of the mortgage market, where documentation was less than for standard mortgages and the credit history of borrowers was generally poor, had been growing as a share of total mortgage origination over the past two years, and had reached about 15 per cent (compared with about 1 per cent in Australia). Within the sub-prime component, the proportion accounted for by variable-rate loans had been growing, to reach about 5 per cent of the total mortgage stock, with the rest accounted for by fixed-rate loans. ", " Members were briefed on the sharp increase in defaults on sub-prime mortgages. These defaults were now approaching 10 per cent of sub-prime mortgage origination. In contrast, defaults on prime fixed- and variable-rate mortgages in the US had remained stable in recent years, at around 1 per cent in aggregate. It was apparent that credit standards had deteriorated over the past few years and some borrowers had become overcommitted. In some cases, when loan ‘honeymoon’ periods ended, borrowers had been unable to pay interest at the current variable rate. Poor underwriting standards and elements of fraud among mortgage originators were being exposed; some originators were going bankrupt and investment banks caught up in this part of the market had suffered sizeable falls in their share price. ", " A recent survey by the Federal Reserve indicated that lenders overall had tightened credit standards significantly. Members commented that there was some risk of an overreaction, leading to a credit squeeze. This could prolong the housing slowdown, and posed a downside risk for the US economy. ", " Turning to financial market developments in Australia, members noted that the decline in the local share market of about 4 per cent in the past month had taken the overall share price index back to the level at the start of the year, which was a better performance than in many other countries. ", " Corporate profits of listed companies, in aggregate, were about 25 per cent higher in underlying terms in the second half of 2006 compared with the same period of 2005. Profits of resource companies had risen by about 40 per cent. Using the most recent earnings data, the aggregate price-earnings ratio had declined to about 15 in February, which was in line with the longer-run average. ", " Analysts' forecasts for growth in corporate earnings of resources companies in the current financial year had been lowered, to 30 per cent, but the forecast for 2007/08 for this group of companies was for growth of about 8 per cent. This latter figure was broadly in line with the forecasts for earnings growth of other companies in both 2006/07 and 2007/08. ", " Market expectations were for no change to monetary policy in Australia during 2007. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Growth of Australia's trading partners, which had averaged around 5 per cent over the past three years, was expected to continue at about 4½ per cent in the next two years, based on Consensus forecasts, with growth becoming more evenly spread geographically. ", " In the US, estimated GDP growth in the December quarter had been revised down to just over 3 per cent, which was still above trend. A slowing to about 2½ per cent was expected in the year ahead, which would constitute a ‘soft landing’. Towards the end of 2006, all sectors apart from housing construction contributed to output growth. Housing permits and starts had fallen substantially and members noted that this would feed through to construction activity over time. The recent monthly figures for these indicators had been volatile, and it was unclear yet whether they were starting to level out. While there was an excess in the housing stock, the current level of housing starts was sufficiently low to begin to wind back unsold inventories. ", " A range of indicators revealed that the market for established houses in the US was also weak, but so far the effect of this on consumption had been minimal. Although there had been some slowing in retail sales, consumption overall had contributed strongly to growth in the December quarter. Good growth in incomes had underpinned consumer demand. Although the rate of growth of employment had eased in recent months, it remained adequate to absorb new entrants to the labour market and keep the unemployment rate steady. This implied that no extra slack in resource availability was being created at present and that inflationary pressures were largely unchanged. The latest CPI data showed that core inflation, which had picked up to 3 per cent in the second half of 2006 and then eased to 2¾ per cent, had risen in January. Headline CPI inflation was lower, but recent movements in oil prices had created considerable volatility in that measure. ", " In Japan, GDP had increased by 2.3 per cent over the course of 2006. Members agreed that this was a strong result, given that trend growth was relatively low in the face of a declining labour force. Economic conditions were returning to normal after the long period of deflation, debt overhang and falls in asset prices. Core CPI inflation was still negative, but bank lending was now growing and property prices in Tokyo were rising; though property prices were still falling on a nationwide basis, the rate of decline was falling steadily. Strongly rising profits were allowing companies to reduce debt. ", " Growth in the world economy was more balanced in 2006 than in the previous few years. In east Asia, GDP growth continued at a good pace in the December quarter, with year-ended growth of close to 5 per cent for the region as a whole. In India, the rapid pace of growth in recent years of over 8 per cent per annum had extended into 2006. India now represented 6 per cent of world GDP on a purchasing power parity basis, and 5 per cent of Australia's exports. GDP in the euro area picked up in the final quarter of 2006, taking growth over the year to 3.3 per cent. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The main high-frequency indicators of consumption were showing good conditions for that component of domestic expenditure. Retail sales had increased strongly in January and the year-ended growth rate of 6.7 per cent was the highest in the past two years. Particular strength had been seen in sales of household goods. Consumer sentiment had picked up in the past two months, though the series remained volatile. Motor vehicle sales had increased sharply in January, with a good part of the increase attributable to sales to businesses. ", " In the housing sector, vacancy rates for rental dwellings had fallen further towards the end of 2006, with the national rate well below 2 per cent. Conditions in several cities and on a nationwide basis were the tightest on record, according to data provided by the Real Estate Institute of Australia. Gross yields for both houses and units had been trending down for the past two decades, in line with yields on other investments, and despite recent rises in rents, these yields were still low. ", " Building approvals had fallen particularly sharply in NSW and were now below the levels prevailing in both Victoria and Queensland. This could be partly explained by the differential in population growth between NSW and these states, but the large overshooting in housing prices in NSW up until 2003 had also been a factor. Members observed that it was possible that development policies in NSW were more constraining than elsewhere in the country. ", " Preliminary indicators of business investment were that spending in real terms was flat in the December quarter and over the course of 2006, following a period of rapid growth in the previous four years. Within the total, non-residential construction was still growing strongly. While total business investment had come off its peak share of GDP during 2006, it remained at a high level and was thereby generating a high rate of growth in the capital stock. ", " Growth in housing credit had increased over the period to the middle of 2006. It had since been a bit softer, particularly for investors, but still at relatively high levels compared with growth in incomes. Business credit growth had slowed only slightly during 2006, with annual growth currently about 16 per cent. ", " Turning to international trade, the current account deficit had increased to 5.9 per cent of GDP in the December quarter, as exports were estimated to have increased only slightly in the quarter while imports had recorded a sharp rise. These data were volatile and in an underlying sense the current account deficit had remained close to its cyclical high of about 6 per cent of GDP in the past few years. ", " The latest contract prices for the bulk commodities of iron ore and steaming coal had increased by around 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, while prices for coking coal had declined by 15 per cent. Taking account of their shares in Australia's exports, the new contract prices would have a roughly neutral net effect on the terms of trade. Base metals prices had been on a strong uptrend during 2006 and these prices fell only slightly in the week following the fall in the Chinese share market. ", " The oil price had been stable at about US$60 per barrel for the past six months, apart from a brief fall to around US$50 per barrel at the turn of the year. ", " In the labour market, despite the small fall in January, employment growth in year-ended terms had remained at 3 per cent. Business surveys continued to show that labour scarcity was a greater concern than a lack of work or sales. According to a survey of small and medium businesses, this had been the case for the past three years, but it was noteworthy that during that time one-third of respondents had no concerns. ", " The wage price index for the December quarter had indicated an increase of 1.1 per cent in the quarter and 4 per cent over the year. Adjusting for the fact that the recently announced minimum wage increase took effect in the March quarter 2007, rather than the September quarter 2006, which would have been the case under the previous wage-setting arrangements, underlying growth in the WPI was estimated to be about 4¼ per cent. This was the same as the peak in growth in 2005. "], "Information Paper – The Productivity Slowdown": [" For some time it had been difficult to reconcile the relatively weak GDP growth with the strength in employment and some other indicators of activity. This paper summarised efforts by the staff to explain the apparent productivity slowdown (or the puzzle of the missing GDP). ", " Several possible reasons had been advanced for the apparent slowdown in productivity growth in the past three years, from a benchmark of 1½-1¾ per cent per annum in earlier decades, but no factor was able to provide an adequate explanation alone. Measurement issues may explain part of the slowdown, and it was possible that recent GDP estimates might be revised up somewhat. Some industry-level explanations included developments in the mining and utilities sectors, but not all of these were easy to understand, and a large part of the overall productivity slowdown could be traced to the non-market sector, for which it was extremely difficult to measure productivity. ", " Any genuine productivity slowdown that has occurred was likely to be related to the high level of capacity utilisation in the economy, especially in the resources sector, which had seen a large increase in the price of its output in recent years. Given that it often took time to put extra capacity in place, some firms may have chosen to meet increases in demand by taking on extra labour, which implied diminishing returns and lower labour productivity. However, these capacity-related effects on productivity should be temporary, rather than permanent. It was difficult to place much weight on some other explanations, such as declining benefits from information technology, which would suggest a more permanent slowdown, in part because they should be affecting productivity in other countries that have not shared Australia's apparent productivity slowdown. Members asked the staff to extend their work to review the debate about productivity in the 1970s, to see if any lessons could be drawn. ", " Looking ahead, members agreed that some pick-up in productivity growth was likely as the temporary restraints eased, but productivity growth would probably not return to the high rates seen earlier in the current expansion. Board members discussed the policy implications of the work that had been undertaken, noting that the uncertainties around estimates of trend productivity growth implied that significant attention needed to be placed on a range of direct measures of resource utilisation and on price and wage pressures in particular. If the true rate of productivity growth was lower than previously believed, the rate of wages growth that was consistent with meeting the inflation target would be correspondingly lower. ", " Members suggested publication of this work. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change in the cash rate in March. ", " The data that had become available over the past month suggested that economic conditions around the world had continued to be strong, with further indications that growth was spreading more evenly across the major economic regions. Domestically, the main data pertaining to inflation came from the wage price index for the December quarter. These showed that wages growth had remained relatively high but had not accelerated beyond 4¼ per cent, and did not cause members to reassess the judgement, reached after the release of the December quarter CPI, that underlying inflation would ease a little over the year ahead. ", " As monetary policy was currently exerting a mildly restraining influence on demand in the economy, with the cash rate and lending rates above normal, members were satisfied that no further policy change was warranted at this stage. The recent instability in financial markets added to the case for maintaining a steady setting of monetary policy for the time being. While members saw no case to change policy at this meeting, they were not sure that rates had been increased sufficiently to bring inflation back towards the centre of the target band. Economic and financial conditions would be monitored over the period ahead to determine if further adjustments to policy would be required.

{"Date": ["Melbourne – 3 April 2007"], "Text": {"Present": [" GR Stevens (Chairman), R Battellino, KR Henry AC, JR Broadbent AO, RC Corbett AM, GJ Kraehe AO, DG McGauchie AO, WJ McKibbin, HM Morgan AC ", " GL Debelle, ML Edey ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 6 March 2007 were approved. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The Board's consideration of current economic conditions commenced with a discussion of the national accounts for the December quarter, which were released on the day following the previous meeting. Growth for the quarter was strong, at 1 per cent. The non-farm economy had grown by 1.4 per cent in the quarter and 3.5 per cent over the year, with the effect of the drought subtracting ¾ percentage point from GDP growth over the past year. This had brought growth in output in the quarter and over the year more into line with other indicators of economic activity – for example, conditions in the labour market and information from business surveys. Members were informed that the staff viewed the apparent lift in growth in the economy as mostly reflecting catch-up from the earlier period of softer growth, though at the margin there did appear to be a little more strength in demand than expected. ", " The stronger national accounts had also lifted measures of productivity. Non-farm labour productivity had increased by 1½ per cent over 2006, which was not far below average. This suggested that the earlier apparent weakness in productivity had been partly a consequence of measurement factors, though some puzzles remained. ", " Over the past year, domestic demand continued to run ahead of output, with net trade subtracting from GDP growth. Nonetheless, domestic demand had slowed, reflecting a lower rate of business investment growth, which had been partly offset by stronger consumption. The downturn in the housing sector was now reaching a trough. Growth in public demand had been significantly higher than growth in private demand, as the states had begun to spend heavily on infrastructure. The gap between domestic demand and output had been sustained for an extended period because domestic incomes had been boosted by the rising terms of trade in the past few years. This meant that while growth in export volumes had been poor, export earnings growth had been considerably higher. ", " The monthly data on consumption were pointing to a strong result for the March quarter. Retail sales had increased at a robust rate in January and February and year-ended growth had increased to 6½–7 per cent. By state, growth in spending over the past year was most rapid in WA, but growth in spending in NSW, though the lowest of the larger states, was still reasonable. Motor vehicle sales in the first two months of the year were running 6 per cent above the rate in the December quarter. Consumer sentiment increased in March towards the highs recorded in 2004. ", " The latest data on house prices indicated that prices in Sydney were flat in the March quarter, while rises were recorded in the other capital cities. In other data for the housing sector, monthly growth in housing credit was running at about 1 per cent in the past few months, after having been noticeably faster for a period in mid 2006. Loan approvals as a share of housing credit outstanding had been on a declining trend in the past three years, but had picked up in February. ", " Business investment growth had slowed to around 2 per cent per annum over 2006, following an extended period of growth around 10–20 per cent, driven by the mining and other sectors. The earlier rapid growth in investment meant that the current share of investment in GDP was high. Members noted that there was an inevitable element of pro-cyclicality in public investment spending, as periods of rapid growth in private investment spending tended to require complementary investment in public infrastructure. ", " Overall business conditions had picked up in the first few months of the year, according to the NAB survey. ", " Turning to international trade, import volumes had increased sharply in the December quarter, to be 10 per cent higher over the year, reflecting strong domestic demand. The terms of trade had risen further in the December quarter and were now clearly higher than the spike in 1974. The net effect on the terms of trade of the new contract prices for bulk commodities would be roughly neutral. With base metals prices having increased recently, the staff expected the terms of trade to rise a little further before beginning to fall over the next couple of years. ", " In the labour market, employment growth was strong in February and year-ended growth remained at 3 per cent. Despite a small fall in job vacancies shown by the ABS survey in the three months to February, the level of vacancies remained high and was consistent with other signs of tightness in the labour market. ", " Members turned their attention to recent developments in economic conditions in the Australian states, as outlined in the Information Paper on ‘Regional Economic Performance’. The most comprehensive measure of growth in state economies was provided by gross state product, but these data were published only annually, with the most recent statistics available for 2005/06. In any event, the data indicated that some divergence in growth among the states was not uncommon, though it was noteworthy that NSW had underperformed the national average for five consecutive years. The current dispersion in growth was partly attributable to the upswing in commodity prices, which meant the underlying economic situation in the resource-rich states differed from that elsewhere in the country. ", " Another important factor in recent years had been divergences in housing cycles. As well as having direct economic effects, the housing cycle was interacting with population growth, adding to the economic divergence. NSW had experienced the most severe housing downturn, and population growth in NSW had slowed sharply in recent years. Recently, however, the rate of net interstate migration from NSW had declined. ", " Employment growth was seen as a more reliable, up-to-date indicator of overall growth in the states than indicators derived from the national accounts. Although NSW had been below average, all states had recorded reasonably good employment growth and falling unemployment in recent years. Members observed that the floating exchange rate and increasingly mobile labour and capital resources, coupled with fiscal stabilisers, which provided a mechanism to redistribute the effects of uneven growth among the states, were helping Australia as a whole to adapt to the terms of trade shock. They noted that the economy was coping better in the current episode, including with less inflation pressure, than in previous episodes of rising terms of trade. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The discussion of international economic conditions focused on the latest developments in the United States. There had been more evidence of weakness in the housing sector, with permits to build falling in February, and it was not clear yet whether the downturn in residential building activity had ended. With construction falling, the stock of unsold new houses was being reduced, though it remained high. Overall growth in the economy had been good and resources in the economy remained close to being fully employed. However, a key question for the Federal Reserve was whether the prospective slowing in growth would be uncomfortably pronounced. While core capital goods orders had fallen sharply in recent months, which implied softer business investment, corporate profits and rates of capacity utilisation still remained high, which were supportive of continued growth in investment. Consumption had increased solidly over the year to February, driven mainly by growth in spending on services, as spending on durable goods had grown more slowly. ", " In all, GDP growth in the US was expected to slow from around 3¼ per cent in 2006 to 2¼ per cent in the current year. Despite the signs of slowing in the economy, core inflation remained relatively high and had edged up in the past few months, which suggested that the decline in inflation seen late last year may have been temporary. Slower growth in output would be required to ease the inflation pressure in the economy, but the problems in the sub-prime mortgage market raised the possibility of a greater degree of slowing than desired. This left US monetary policy delicately poised at present, with the Fed facing slightly higher inflation at the same time as growing downside risks to the real economy. ", " According to as yet unpublished IMP forecasts, world GDP growth was expected to slow from 5¼ per cent in 2006 to 4¾ per cent in 2007. The US was the main source of slowing next year. While other parts of the world were expected to slow a little, they were nevertheless likely to continue to record solid growth. "], "Outlook for the Australian Economy": [" Revised forecasts presented to the Board following the release of the December quarter national accounts and recent economic indicators were for non-farm GDP to grow by around 3½ per cent over the year ahead, which was a slight upgrade from the previous forecast of 3¼ per cent. Overall GDP growth was forecast to bounce back over the period ahead, assuming a return to more normal conditions in the farm sector. The inflation forecast was unchanged at 2¾ per cent, but the risks appeared to have shifted to the upside over the preceding month. These risks were mainly sourced domestically and were offset to some extent by the likely effect on inflation of the higher exchange rate and the increased downside risks to the US economy. The inflation outlook would be reviewed again next month to take into account the March quarter CPI result. "], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": [" Developments in the US sub-prime mortgage market had received increased press and regulatory coverage since the previous meeting. Most observers felt that these developments posed downside risks to the US economy, though to date there was no evidence of a sharp contraction in mortgage approvals. Also, the associated heightened volatility in financial markets had dissipated quickly. ", " In terms of policy interest rates in major countries, the ECB had raised rates to 3.75 per cent and markets expected one more increase in the next six months. The Fed had not changed its policy settings, but the market expected weakness in the housing sector and investment to give rise to an easing in the next few months. The Fed's recent statements were interpreted to mean that it had moved from a tightening bias to a more neutral position, though as it remained concerned about inflation, an imminent easing in monetary policy was not likely. The Bank of Japan was on hold. In other countries, the RBNZ had tightened to 7½ per cent, and increases in rates in Switzerland and Norway were part of the process of normalising policy settings. In the third increase in the past year, the Chinese authorities had increased interest rates by 27 basis points to try to stem the growth in investment and credit. ", " Global bond yields had been relatively stable over the past month, and in the US were currently at 4.65 per cent. Spreads in emerging markets had narrowed over the month, following the period of heightened market volatility. US corporate spreads were largely unchanged, with the exception of junk bonds, which were still a little higher. ", " Equity markets over the past month had recovered a significant part of the earlier fall, including in emerging markets. The Australian market had outperformed other markets and was close to the recent peak. The Chinese equity market had rebounded strongly from the recent fall and had passed the earlier peak. While volatility in equity markets had spiked up in March, the increase was less than that seen in the April/May period of 2006 and during the ‘dot com’ boom and bust around the turn of the century. ", " Members noted that, based on analysis of P/E ratios, there was little sign of market overvaluation around the world, apart from China, where the ratio was high. However, they also noted that earnings forecasts generally assumed that the high share of profits in national income and high rates of earnings growth would continue. This may be overly optimistic. In Australia, P/E ratios were around average for all sectors except resources, where the ratio was currently a bit below average. ", " Turning to exchange rates, the US dollar had continued its gradual depreciation against the euro, though it remained strong against the yen. ", " Over the past month, the Australian dollar had risen against all currencies in the trade-weighted basket, with an overall increase of 3 per cent. The current exchange rate against the US dollar of just under US82 cents was close to the high reached in December 1996. Over the past year, the TWI had increased by 10 per cent, with the rise mostly against the US dollar and yen as well as currencies closely linked to the US dollar. There had been less of a rise against other currencies, such as the UK pound, the euro and the New Zealand dollar. Measured on a trade-weighted basis and against the US dollar, the current levels of the Australian dollar were well above post-float averages. Against the yen, the Australian dollar had regained the level last seen in May 1997. However, against the euro, the Australian dollar was only about average since the euro's inception. ", " Market expectations for a tightening of monetary policy in Australia had increased since the previous meeting, with the market fairly evenly divided on the prospect of a move at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change to the cash rate in April. ", " In discussing the recommendation, Board members focused on three main considerations. ", " First, most of the information that had come to hand over recent months was pointing to strength in the domestic economy. Retail sales, motor vehicle registrations and employment had all been solid in recent months. There were also signs of an upturn in the housing market. The national accounts had until recently been at odds with the more general run of data, but the stronger December quarter figures had brought them into line. Members noted that the forecast for growth of non-farm GDP over the year ahead had been revised up to 3½ per cent. ", " Second, while figures on the global economy had, on balance, continued to be strong in recent months, quite a number of commentators in the US were expecting that the problems in the sub-prime housing loan market would weaken the US economy more than had been predicted. It was noted also that the US Fed had become less convinced about the capacity of the economy to keep growing. Members agreed that any noticeable weakening in the US economy would almost certainly spill over to the rest of the world. ", " Third, the latest set of domestic price data, albeit somewhat dated, had been better than expected. It was not clear whether this was a genuine signal of declining price pressures or simply ‘noise’ in the data. New figures in a month's time would help clarify the situation. ", " In the light of all this, members agreed that the recent strength in the domestic economy would add some upside risks to the outlook for inflation. This, of itself, meant that the case for tightening policy was growing. On the other hand, the uncertainty about the recent path of inflation and about the outlook for the US and global economies meant that it would be prudent to wait another month, to see the March quarter CPI and evaluate further the US outlook, before taking any decision to raise interest rates further.

Growth in east Asia, including China, had slowed a little further. ", " Members noted that the gradual slowing of Chinese economic growth had been accompanied by declining exports to Europe for some time and, more recently, falls in exports to the United States and Japan. The slowing of growth in China had resulted in weaker demand for steel, which was evident in the falls in steel and iron ore prices in August and had resulted in lower steel production. The Chinese authorities had announced a number of infrastructure projects, although the additional stimulus that this imparted was likely to be modest in the near term. The housing market appeared to have turned but, with prices picking up in recent months, controls on the property market that sought to improve affordability were likely to remain in place, at least in the near term. ", " The slowing of growth in Japan and other parts of east Asia in recent months partly reflected softer global demand, which had weighed on exports and industrial production, particularly for electronic products. Consumer confidence remained subdued across the region. Despite the slowing in economic activity, there had been little recent further monetary easing in the region, apart from Japan. ", " Indicators over the past month suggested that the US economy continued to expand at a modest pace. Members noted that while there had been a few positive developments, growth in important parts of the economy remained restrained. The housing market was improving gradually, with both turnover and prices picking up in recent months. In contrast, labour market conditions remained subdued, with employment growth noticeably slower than earlier in the year. The Federal Reserve referred to this weakness when it announced additional monetary stimulus measures in September. ", " Economic activity in both the euro area and the United Kingdom was continuing to contract amid weak domestic demand, with investment remaining subdued. Members observed that growth had slowed even in the better-performing economies. Although some further progress had been made in resolving the banking and fiscal problems in Europe, these problems were likely to present large downside risks to the world economy for some time. ", " Overall, commodity prices were relatively flat in net terms over the month. The spot price for iron ore had recovered some of the sharp fall in August. In contrast, the spot price for coking coal had continued to drift lower. The prices for both commodities remained around 25 per cent below their levels in June. The terms of trade were estimated to have fallen further in the September quarter to be more than 10 per cent below their peak a year earlier. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The June quarter national accounts were released the day after the September Board meeting. Members observed that, after abstracting from the effects of the earlier natural disasters, growth over the year had been close to trend. Growth in the quarter was below the very strong growth recorded in the March quarter, with growth in consumption slowing, although it was still broadly in line with that of income. Looking through the monthly volatility, liaison suggested that retail sales were growing at around the pace seen prior to the recent household assistance payments. Sales of motor vehicles had increased strongly in recent months. ", " Growth in business investment was lower in the June quarter than in the previous quarter, despite another stronger-than-expected rise in resource investment. The recent volatility in iron ore and coal prices had also affected the outlook for mining investment over the next year or two. Mining companies had become increasingly reluctant to commit to new investment projects that had been under active consideration and, in some cases, had delayed spending on committed projects and closed some older, higher-cost mines earlier than had been expected. While the prospects for LNG projects remained positive, some projects were running behind schedule for various logistical reasons, and members noted that there had been cost overruns on some projects. ", " These developments suggested that the forecast profile for mining investment might not be quite as strong as previously expected. Overall, resource investment could peak earlier, and at a lower level, than had previously been forecast. While there remained considerable uncertainty about the outlook, the lower resource investment profile suggested growth in demand and output over the coming year could be below previous forecasts. Members discussed the implications of the revised outlook for the labour market and tax receipts. ", " Members noted that, broadly in line with expectations, non-mining investment had declined in the June quarter. Business surveys showed that business conditions outside the mining and transport sectors had remained a little below their long-run average, with the construction industry especially weak. In addition, business credit was broadly flat in July and August after picking up earlier in the year. ", " Dwelling investment remained at a low level in the June quarter, although there were signs of improving sentiment in the housing market more recently. Members noted that weak dwelling investment had been at odds with the fundamentals for housing demand, as evidenced by the relatively low vacancy rate, below-average mortgage rates and ongoing population growth. They observed that, in some areas, developers had difficulties selling new dwellings given their prices relative to existing dwellings. ", " The improvement in sentiment in the housing market had been accompanied by an increase in dwelling prices in recent months. Household credit had been growing a little more slowly than household incomes, with members discussing the desire of households to pay down their debts ahead of schedule, helped by the reductions in borrowing rates. ", " Labour market conditions appeared to have eased in recent months, even though the unemployment rate had remained broadly unchanged at a little above 5 per cent. After picking up in the first half of the year, the ratio of employment to population had fallen back over recent months. Softer demand for labour had been particularly pronounced in the construction industry, with employment there falling from relatively high levels. In addition, mining employment had recorded a modest decline in recent months for the first time since the middle of 2009. Labour productivity across the economy as a whole had increased at an above-average pace over the past year. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members discussed the key events that occurred shortly after the previous Board meeting, each of which had unfolded in a broadly positive manner for financial markets. These included a decision by the German Constitutional Court to reject a complaint against the legality of the European Stability Mechanism, thereby allowing it to go ahead, as well as the outcome of general elections in the Netherlands, which saw pro-euro-area parties secure a majority. The stress tests covering the Spanish banks were released late in September and broadly met expectations, with the banking system estimated to require an additional €60 billion in capital. ", " Following its September meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) confirmed its willingness to purchase shorter-term sovereign bonds in secondary markets in an effort to safeguard the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Purchases would be subject to strict conditionality on governments and members noted that the program had not yet commenced, with Spain expected to be the first country to seek assistance. The European Commission released proposals for a single supervisory mechanism for euro area banks, including that the ECB be given this responsibility. However, the proposals were unlikely to be introduced before the end of the year. ", " The US Federal Reserve also announced additional actions to ease monetary policy by expanding its asset purchases and extending its forward rate guidance. The Fed explicitly linked its policy outlook to economic outcomes, stating that asset purchases would continue until there was a significant improvement in the labour market. In addition, the Bank of Japan increased the size of its asset purchase program. ", " The market reaction to these policy actions had generally been positive. Share prices in the major economies rose through much of September, with bank shares outperforming the broader market, before some falls occurred late in the month. The one notable exception was China, where share prices had resumed their downward trend after a brief rally. Domestically, the share market had also rallied with the improvement in global sentiment. ", " Government bond yields in Italy and Spain declined significantly, particularly at the short end, with two-year yields falling by around 250 and 300 basis points, respectively, since ECB President Draghi's ‘whatever it takes’ comments in late July. Yields in the major advanced economies remained at low levels. ", " Members noted that, more broadly, credit conditions had improved, with US non-financial corporates continuing to issue debt at a solid pace and funding conditions for many European non-financial corporates improving. Members noted that a sizeable part of the recent issuance reflected corporate refinancing of existing debt at lower rates. Australian banks had also issued a range of securities and large volumes over September, including covered bonds, unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. Strong investor support for these issues had translated into lower spreads. Similarly, some of the larger Australian companies had undertaken sizeable issuance into overseas markets at narrower spreads than a few months earlier and for terms of up to 30 years. ", " The ECB's announcement regarding secondary market purchases of shorter-term sovereign bonds boosted the euro, while the Fed's actions led to a depreciation of the US dollar. The decline in the yen following the Bank of Japan's policy action was only temporary, with the yen still close to its historical high in nominal terms and the US dollar near its all-time low in trade-weighted terms. The Australian dollar depreciated only slightly in trade-weighted terms over the month. Members noted that the Australian dollar remained high by historical standards, notwithstanding the fall in commodity prices and weaker global and domestic outlook. ", " Members discussed the significant uncertainties that remained about the effectiveness of the various unconventional monetary policy actions that had been taken, including in the euro area. One element was whether Spain would apply for support from the ECB and, if it did, how long it would take for any program to be ratified by various European parliaments. In addition, the troika of official agencies reviewing Greece had not released its appraisal and there were indications that Greece was falling well short of its targets. As markets had re-focused on these issues in recent days, some of the initial positive reaction had reversed. ", " Domestically, members were briefed on the funding composition of Australian banks, with deposits accounting for 53 per cent of major banks' funding and likely to remain the key driver of funding costs in the near term. In the money market, current market pricing implied a significant probability of a 25 basis point easing in monetary policy at this meeting. Thereafter, pricing had the cash rate falling to around 2½ per cent by the middle of 2013. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that recent indicators suggested that the pace of global growth had edged down. In response to the weaker economic outlook, further monetary stimulus had been put in place in the major advanced economies. The weaker outlook had also seen bulk commodity prices decline and, while prices for steel and iron ore had partially retraced the sharp falls that occurred over July and August, members noted that there had been a noticeable decline in the appetite for spending by Australian companies in some parts of the resources sector. Notwithstanding the expectation of some recovery in the prices of bulk commodities over the coming quarters, it seemed likely that mining investment would peak a little earlier, and at a somewhat lower level, than had previously been forecast. At the same time, the lower peak could be associated with a more gradual decline subsequently, and resource investment as a share of GDP would likely remain at a high level for several years. ", " Members agreed that it was too soon to see much, if any, of the effects of recent developments in bulk commodity markets on domestic economic activity. Likewise, it was too early to see the full effects of earlier reductions in interest rates. Members noted that the labour market had been somewhat softer in recent months, although this was not inconsistent with earlier forecasts for the economy. Other recent data on economic activity had been broadly in line with earlier expectations about the pace of growth. Looking ahead, the forecast for GDP still anticipated mining investment making a significant contribution to growth in the coming quarters, with non-resource investment remaining weak, some possibility of an increase in dwelling investment, consumption growing broadly in line with incomes, and public demand subtracting from growth. Nonetheless, the information that had become available suggested there was an increased likelihood of growth over the coming year being somewhat weaker than earlier forecast. ", " At its previous meeting, the Board had observed that the effects of earlier reductions in the cash rate were still working through the domestic economy, and that the outlook for inflation was consistent with the target over the next one to two years. Members concluded that the current assessment of the inflation outlook provided scope to adjust policy in response to the softer growth outlook. Therefore, at this meeting the Board judged that it was appropriate for the stance of monetary policy to be a little more accommodative, thereby providing some additional support to demand over the period ahead. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 per cent, effective 3 October. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 1 May 2007"], "Text": {"Present": [" GR Stevens (Chairman), R Battellino, KR Henry AC, JR Broadbent AO, RC Corbett AM, GJ Kraehe AO, DG McGauchie AO, WJ McKibbin, HM Morgan AC ", " GL Debelle, ML Edey ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 3 April 2007 were approved. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The discussion of international economic conditions commenced with an assessment of the latest developments in the US economy. GDP growth in the March quarter had been 0.3 per cent, broadly around the ½ per cent quarterly rate that had been recorded for the past year. As a result, year-ended growth was now 2.1 per cent. Domestic spending had also been running at a quarterly pace of around ½ per cent for the past year, which represented a slowing from the above-trend pace previously. The main driver of the slowing in growth had been housing construction. Excluding the effect of the housing slowdown, growth had remained at around 3 per cent, which suggested reasonable strength in other sectors of the economy. Employment growth had exhibited a similar pattern to that of GDP growth: it was slowing but so far had remained rapid enough to push down unemployment. ", " In the US housing sector, there was some evidence to suggest that the forward indicators of construction, namely permits to build and starts, were bottoming out. These had fallen by 30 per cent since the peak in early 2006 and the level of starts was now low enough for stocks of unsold dwellings to be eroded. Nevertheless, even with no further falls in starts, housing activity was likely to be a restraining influence on GDP growth until the second half of the year. ", " In other parts of the world, growth remained strong. IMF and private-sector forecasts were that the overall slowdown in 2007 would be mild and concentrated in the US. Growth was forecast to be around 5 per cent in 2007, down from 5½ per cent in 2006. World growth was expected to remain around 5 per cent in 2008. ", " China had recorded further strong GDP growth in the March quarter, with the result corroborated by information on industrial production and retail spending. Members discussed the sustainable growth rate of the Chinese economy. This was difficult to measure as changes in internal labour migration patterns, in particular, could lead to significant changes in resource availability and productivity. Other influences on China's potential growth were domestic absorption and the capacity of other countries to absorb China's output, as well as the environmental implications of ongoing rapid industrialisation. ", " There had been little new information on the Japanese economy, which had recorded several years of good growth. The Tankan business survey showed that business conditions were currently above average and had continued to improve. This survey tracked GDP reasonably well. Bank lending growth appeared to have stabilised at around 2 per cent per annum, which was relatively low. Some other indicators also suggested that growth was levelling out. ", " The euro-area economy had strengthened over the past year, noticeably in Germany but growth in other countries had also increased. Industrial production was rising by 4 per cent, which was the fastest rate since 2000. Consumer and business sentiment had increased steadily over the past two years. Inflation was slightly higher and it was evident that the European Central Bank was looking to tighten monetary policy further. ", " In the UK, inflation of 3.1 per cent over the year to March had breached the 1 percentage point margin above the target, which had triggered an explanatory letter from the Governor of the Bank of England to the Chancellor. This was the first time this had been required since the current inflation-targeting and accountability arrangements were introduced a decade ago. While the economy had recorded a good average growth rate since the early 1990s and inflation was likely to fall below 3 per cent in the near term, signs of overheating in the housing market and the high exchange rate posed policy challenges. ", " In east Asia, there had been some cyclical easing in growth over the past year, driven by slower growth in exports to the US. GDP data for the March quarter were available only for Korea, where growth had slowed to 3.9 per cent from above 5 per cent a year earlier. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that consumer spending had accelerated in the past few months. While no new retail sales data had been reported since the previous meeting, motor vehicle sales in March were 6 per cent higher than the average in the December quarter. Consumer sentiment up to April was back to levels seen two or three years earlier. This series was volatile and only the low-frequency movements conveyed useful information. ", " Loan approvals as a share of housing credit outstanding were running at the low end of the recent range, but had picked up in the past few months following a noticeable slowing during the second half of 2006. A similar pattern was evident in the monthly growth of housing credit, which indicated that the easing in the demand for finance had not persisted. ", " Members discussed the sustainability of the current pace of overall household credit growth, having considered this on several previous occasions. While they noted that recent growth rates had been relatively fast, they also noted that many other countries had been experiencing fast credit growth. They concluded that structural changes were taking place in the way that households managed their financial affairs, which made it difficult to judge what a sustainable rate of credit growth might be. They acknowledged that the increases in household debt that had taken place over the past decade had, at least to date, not caused any systemic financial stress in the household sector. ", " The latest data on house prices indicated that prices in Sydney and Perth had been relatively flat in recent months and prices in other capital cities were rising modestly. In Sydney, the flat picture for average house prices masked a widening gap between prices at the upper end of the market, which were showing modest gains, and prices in the cheapest suburbs, which were still declining. Members noted that there had been an increase in repossessions in south-western Sydney, though the aggregate figures were still low. A similar development, though to a considerably lesser extent, had also occurred in parts of Melbourne. ", " In another indicator of activity in the secondary housing market, rising auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne confirmed an improvement in conditions in those parts of the market where auctions were prevalent. ", " Total credit growth was steady at about 15 per cent over the year to March. Taking a longer perspective, over the past three years there had been a shift in the growth of credit from households to businesses, and in the past year or so growth in credit to businesses had exceeded growth in credit to households. This reflected a trend towards higher gearing among businesses in a world that had seen macroeconomic stability, low volatility and high returns to equity for several years. It seemed that businesses were assuming that these conditions would persist. Members expressed some concern about the possible wider economic and financial implications should this assumption prove unwarranted, though they recognised that the developments they had observed were at an early stage and the potential dynamics of the private equity developments, in particular, were difficult to assess. ", " Turning to international trade, growth in import volumes was estimated to have remained strong in the March quarter, exceeding 10 per cent on a year-ended basis, which reflected solid domestic demand. Export volumes had continued on the mild uptrend seen over the past few years. Strong growth in export prices was estimated to have driven a further sharp rise in export values in the March quarter. The relatively modest growth in overall export volumes in the face of robust external demand was best understood by examining disaggregated data for the resources component. Members noted that while iron ore and, to a lesser extent, coal exports had increased rapidly in recent years, a trend decline in oil exports, owing to the depletion of existing oil fields, had weighed on the figures for total resource exports. ", " Commodity prices had continued to rise in the past month. Over the past few years, all components of the base metals index had risen sharply; nickel prices had increased eightfold since 2003. ", " Members were informed that the likely effect of the current drought was to reduce farm GDP by 23 per cent in 2006/07. Assuming a return to normal seasonal conditions in the following year, farm output was expected to bounce-back from the lower level by 22 per cent, though of course these figures were highly uncertain. ", " Conditions in the labour market had remained strong, with a further rise in employment in March and a decline in the unemployment rate to a generational low of 4.5 per cent. ", " The CPI had increased by 0.1 per cent in the March quarter. A sharp fall in banana prices subtracted significantly from the overall result. Underlying inflation was assessed to have been about ½ per cent in the March quarter and 2.7 per cent over the year, having eased from 3 per cent over the course of 2006. Members noted that the result for the quarter was lower than expected, which meant that the two most recent quarterly readings on underlying inflation, which were both about ½ per cent, provided a signal that inflationary pressures had eased since mid 2006. They were informed that there was no single factor that could be identified as having caused the outcome to be lower than expected; rather, there appeared to have been a generalised pattern of moderating price increases. ", " Turning to the outlook for inflation, members took account of wages growth running at about 4¼ per cent, adjusting for the changed timing of the most recent minimum wage increase, and the fact that capacity utilisation was currently at its highest level on record. They also noted that domestic demand was increasing at a solid pace and labour resources were scarce, as suggested by the current low unemployment rate and indications from business surveys that a lack of suitable labour was the most significant constraint on production. Some disinflation from the higher exchange rate was expected in the near term, but this effect was not likely to be large. While the assessment was that underlying inflation could decline to around 2½ per cent, or possibly lower, in the short term, inflationary pressures were expected to re-emerge in 2008. As a result, the staff forecast was for inflation to follow a lower short-term trajectory than previously expected, but rise to about 2¾ per cent over the course of 2008. CPI inflation was forecast to fall below 2 per cent in the near term before rising back to the underlying rate. It was noted that the low headline CPI figures expected in the short term would be of some assistance in helping to contain inflation expectations and wage pressures. "], "Financial Markets": [" There had been little change in monetary policy among the major countries over the past month, but market expectations were for further tightening by some central banks. ", " In the US, no change to the Fed funds rate was expected at the meeting scheduled for 9 May. Although the market had priced in an easing by the end of the year, rhetoric from the Fed itself suggested concerns about inflation remained paramount. The European Central Bank was expected to raise rates twice more during the months ahead. In Japan, near-zero inflation meant that the Bank of Japan was not expected to change policy in the near term. Interest rates had been increased to 7.75 per cent in New Zealand, and further increases were expected to be implemented by the Bank of England, including at its meeting in the following week. The Chinese authorities had tightened credit conditions in the past month, and for the seventh time in the past year, in an attempt to rein in rapid growth of money and credit, which was a consequence of ongoing rapid accumulation of reserves. ", " Bond yields in the US and Japan were little changed in net terms over the past month, while German yields had increased. The narrowing in the spread of German yields to those in the US market reflected relatively stronger economic conditions in the euro area. ", " Yield spreads in the US corporate bond market had not fully retraced their rise following the period of volatility in financial markets in late February, but emerging market spreads had largely done so. ", " Developments in the US sub-prime mortgage market still bore close watching. Market conditions had settled considerably since earlier in the year, but members noted that it was not yet clear whether the effects of the recent problems had largely passed. ", " Turning to foreign exchange markets, the main development over the past month was the further depreciation of both the US dollar and the yen. On average against the major currencies, the US dollar was around the lowest point in the era of floating exchange rates. However, in real terms, i.e. adjusting for relative inflation in the US and its trading partners, the trade-weighted exchange rate had been lower in the late 1980s and early 1990s. ", " Several currencies had reached multi-year highs against the US dollar. The euro had reached its highest level since 1992, the British pound its highest level since 1981, the Canadian dollar was near a three-decade high, and the New Zealand dollar had reached a post-float high. ", " In China, the pace of appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar had slowed. The exchange rate had appreciated by 7 per cent since the revaluation in July 2005. The Chinese authorities had continued to accumulate reserves at a rapid rate. These were now up to US$1.2 trillion, US$200–300 billion of which was earmarked for investment in assets other than US Treasuries. Noting that the US Congress had introduced a tariff on imports of glossy paper from China, in a test case before the WTO, members observed that global imbalances posed risks of increased measures to curtail free trade around the world; these were a greater risk to continued economic prosperity than the possibility of disruptive exchange-rate adjustments. ", " In contrast to the Chinese experience, the Indian rupee had approached the high levels seen a decade earlier, despite efforts at intervention by the Indian authorities. Foreign currency reserves in India had increased to US$200 billion. ", " The yen had been relatively steady against the US dollar in recent months, but was at an historical low point against the euro. ", " Similar to most other major currencies, the Australian dollar had risen noticeably against the US dollar and the yen in recent months. It was, however, little changed against the euro, pound, New Zealand dollar and Canadian dollar. Nonetheless, the trade-weighted index had recorded a two-decade high. ", " Share prices in most markets had rebounded since the falls in late February; the increases in European share prices had been greater than those in the US. Share prices in Japan had not been as strong as elsewhere, and had shown little change since the start of the year after the sharp increases in the previous two years. Chinese share prices had increased sharply since the beginning of the year and were now much higher than before the fall in February. ", " The Australian share market was among the strongest performers in recent months. Prices had risen by 9 per cent over the year to date, with the increase broadly based across sectors. Nonetheless, price-earnings ratios did not seem to be out of line with normal levels. ", " Market expectations for a tightening of monetary policy in Australia had been scaled back substantially following release of the March quarter CPI. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change to the cash rate in May. ", " In discussing the recommendation, Board members noted that there had been a modest slowing in US GDP, though this was not expected to lead to a pronounced global slowing; current forecasts were for a continued solid expansion in world GDP. Members also noted that recent domestic activity data had been solid. However, members felt that the most significant piece of news during the past month had been the CPI for the March quarter. They recalled that, at the time of the February Board meeting, December quarter data for underlying inflation had been lower than expected, but that at that point it had been difficult to discern ‘signal’ from ‘noise’ in the data. The latest CPI data were regarded as providing confirmation that prices had indeed increased more modestly over the past six months than had been the case around the middle of 2006. ", " Members noted that the outlook was now that underlying inflation would be around 2½ per cent in 2007, a little lower than earlier forecasts. However, they expected that the strength of the economy would again increase inflationary pressures in the medium term. In discussing how policy should respond to this, members agreed that the recent and prospective moderation in inflation meant that any pick-up in inflation would begin from a lower level. They also noted that monetary policy was already moderately restrictive, and the effects of previous policy tightening were still to be felt fully. The Board concluded that these considerations meant that there was more time to evaluate the strength of inflationary pressures and the appropriate monetary policy response, and accordingly, they decided that no change to the cash rate was necessary for the time being. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.25 per cent. "]}},

The pace of growth in China appeared to have stabilised in response to the earlier fiscal and monetary stimulus, with a pick-up in infrastructure construction. Timely measures of production and spending were mixed, but had generally been stronger in recent months. ", " Members observed that the US economy continued to expand at a moderate pace. Growth in GDP and consumption picked up a little in the September quarter, although business investment had weakened. Employment growth had improved in the past four months relative to earlier in the year, and housing prices and commencements continued to rise, albeit from low levels. While significant uncertainty remained over the extent and effect of fiscal consolidation from early 2013, members noted that a positive resolution of this matter could result in better growth prospects. ", " Economic activity in Europe remained weak. The PMIs and household and business sentiment remained at low levels across the region, including in France and Germany, which until recently had been more resilient. ", " The Japanese economy had weakened in the September quarter, with falls in consumption and exports. Growth in the rest of east Asia was also relatively subdued in the quarter, partly reflecting weakness in consumption, especially for the higher-income economies. Exports and industrial production were soft, though more recent data generally showed a slight improvement. In response to weaker growth, monetary and fiscal policies had been eased a little over recent months in some countries in the region. ", " Commodity prices had been mixed over the month. Members noted that the spot price for iron ore had recently increased in line with a rise in steel production and prices, but remained well below levels seen earlier in the year. In contrast, spot prices for both thermal and coking coal had declined further. Global food prices were higher and base metals prices remained broadly unchanged from the middle of the year. The terms of trade were estimated to have declined further in the September quarter, and were forecast to be 15 per cent below their 2011 peak by the end of 2012. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that inflation in the September quarter was a little higher than had been expected. Various measures suggested that underlying inflation was around ¾ per cent in the quarter and around 2½ per cent over the year. The headline CPI rose by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, and was 2 per cent higher over the year. These outcomes reflected, in part, the introduction of the carbon price, which had had a noticeable effect on electricity and gas prices. New dwelling prices had picked up unexpectedly, as had grocery prices. Inflation in health prices had increased as a result of a tightening in the eligibility for the private health insurance rebate. Partly offsetting these effects was a softening in the inflation of rents in the quarter and subdued rises in the prices of a range of market services. ", " Tradables inflation picked up in the September quarter, partly owing to strong increases in fruit and vegetable prices. Members noted that there had been small increases in many other tradables prices over the past two quarters after earlier declines. This suggested that the downward pressure on tradables prices from the earlier appreciation of the exchange rate was waning. ", " After a long period of stability, the unemployment rate increased in September, which was consistent with other indicators that had suggested the labour market had softened in recent months. There had been a substantial fall in construction employment over the past year, reflecting a somewhat delayed response to persistently weak conditions in parts of that sector. Leading indicators of labour demand had softened a bit further, suggesting modest near-term employment growth was likely. ", " Overall, growth of the Australian economy had slowed from an above-trend pace earlier in the year, with recent indicators of activity suggesting that economic growth was more moderate in the September quarter. ", " Household consumption appeared to have slowed from the strong pace seen earlier in the year to a pace around, or a little below, trend in the September quarter, in line with income growth. Retail sales values increased through the quarter, although sales volumes fell slightly following the fading of the impetus from earlier government household assistance payments. Nevertheless, members observed that sales of motor vehicles to households had been strong in recent months. Liaison suggested that the value of retail spending rose in October, though some of this may have reflected higher prices rather than higher volumes. ", " There were tentative indications that housing activity may be reaching a turning point. Over recent months, the number of private residential building approvals had increased, as had dwelling prices, and auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had continued to rise. ", " Members observed that business surveys suggested that conditions were a little below their long-run average level. Conditions in the mining sector had declined since earlier in the year, but had improved in retail and manufacturing to around long-run average levels. Weaker sentiment in mining apparently reflected the decline in bulk commodity prices over recent months and was consistent with the outlook for more modest growth in mining investment. Outside the mining sector, indicators of private non-residential investment remained relatively subdued, although business credit grew in September, after two months of essentially no growth, and non-intermediated funding had increased. Exports were estimated to have been weak in the September quarter, owing to softer global demand for coal. ", " The Government had recently released its mid-year economic update. Newly announced policy changes did not materially alter the assessment (from a range of sources) that the move from a Federal budget deficit to a small surplus could subtract somewhere between ¾ and 1½ percentage points from growth in 2012/13. ", " Members were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. The forecast for GDP growth was a little lower than that presented three months earlier, largely reflecting the change to the profile for mining investment. Over the year to June 2013, growth was expected to be a little below 2¾ per cent, before gradually picking up to around 3 per cent over 2014. The slightly softer outlook for economic activity overall was expected to be reflected in the labour market over the near term. Employment growth was consequently forecast to remain relatively modest over the course of the next year, before rising gradually towards the end of the forecast period. ", " Members observed that the inflation forecast was largely unchanged from three months earlier, with underlying inflation expected to remain consistent with the inflation target over the next two years. Although the rate of inflation over the year to the September quarter was a little higher than had earlier been forecast, raising the starting point for the projections, the effect of this on the inflation forecast was offset by the slightly weaker outlook for domestic economic activity and employment. Based on earlier Treasury modelling, the carbon price was expected to boost underlying inflation by around ¼ percentage point over 2012/13, and headline inflation by around 0.7 percentage points. The combination of the carbon price effect and volatility in fruit and vegetable prices was expected to see headline inflation rise above 3 per cent in year-ended terms in the first half of 2013, before declining to around 2½ per cent thereafter. "], "Financial Markets": [" While there was relatively little news affecting financial markets over the past month, market conditions generally continued to improve, supported by the better-than-expected flow of economic data, along with the ongoing effects of the actions taken earlier by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Federal Reserve. Members were briefed on the recent experience internationally with unconventional monetary policies and the potential lessons they held, including for Australia. ", " Members noted that the lack of unsettling news out of Europe in the past month had also supported financial markets, despite the absence of substantive progress by European policymakers in dealing with the underlying issues. Spain had not yet decided whether to apply for a precautionary financial assistance program, a pre-condition for the ECB to purchase sovereign bonds under its recently announced Outright Monetary Transactions program. Italian and Spanish government bond yields fell further over the month to be around their lowest levels since early 2012. On Greece, the outcome of the review by the troika of officials from the IMF, ECB and EU was expected soon. ", " Yields in major government bond markets, currencies and equities were all little changed over the past month. After falling over much of the past six months, share prices in China had risen in October, supported by better-than-expected economic data. The Australian share market was also higher, in part reflecting the stronger Chinese economic data. The Australian dollar was little changed over the month, both against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis, and remained at a high level. ", " Members were briefed on credit conditions, which continued to improve for both US and European corporates in October. Spreads on bank bonds had narrowed significantly since mid year. Issuance remained solid, particularly for non-financial firms in the United States that had taken advantage of extremely low yields to refinance their existing debt. Australian corporates maintained good access to debt markets, with secondary market bond spreads tightening further over the month. ", " Following the October cash rate announcement, most lenders in Australia had reduced their standard variable housing loan rates by around 20 basis points. The average interest rate on outstanding housing loans was now about 75 basis points below the post-1996 average, while rates on small and large business loans were 75 and 125 basis points below average. Competition for deposits remained strong, with deposit funding accounting for more than half of total bank funding. ", " The Board's decision to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points at the October meeting had been largely anticipated by the market and did not have a large effect on the yield curve. Members noted that current market pricing implied around an even chance of a 25 basis point easing in monetary policy at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" For the global economy, data received over the previous month had been somewhat more positive. In particular, the US economy continued to expand at a moderate pace and there were signs that the pace of growth in China may have stabilised. Recent policy announcements in Europe had helped to bolster financial market conditions, though economic activity there remained weak. A significant deterioration in financial and economic conditions in the euro area remained a downside risk for global growth, although risks elsewhere were more balanced. ", " For Australia, a range of indicators suggested that the economy had been growing around trend pace over recent months, having slowed from above-trend growth earlier in the year. The staff forecast for GDP growth over 2013 was revised down, largely because of a change to the mining investment profile. However, there was considerable uncertainty about the timing of spending for mining investment projects, given their size and complexity. While a gradual recovery in both dwelling and other business investment was anticipated, assisted in part by the lower level of interest rates, there was also uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of this pick up. Hence, there was uncertainty about the overall pace of growth of demand in the economy over the forecast period. ", " Members noted that the staff's forecast was for underlying inflation to remain close to 2½ per cent over the next two years, apart from the temporary effect of the carbon price. With the disinflationary effect of the earlier exchange rate appreciation on tradable prices waning, this forecast was predicated on the assumption of ongoing productivity growth and some moderation in the growth of wages to contain domestic cost pressures. ", " The Board's decision at the October meeting to reduce the cash rate had pushed borrowing interest rates a little lower relative to their average levels. The effects of the earlier reductions in the cash rate were, meanwhile, continuing to work their way through the economy, and members expected that further effects of these changes were yet to be observed. Members considered that further easing may be appropriate in the period ahead. However, at this meeting, with prices data for the September quarter slightly higher than expected and recent information on the world economy slightly more positive, the Board judged that the stance of monetary policy was appropriate for the time being. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.25 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 6 February 2007"], "Text": {"Present": [" GR Stevens (Chairman), KR Henry AC, JR Broadbent AO, RC Corbett AM, DG McGauchie AO, WJ McKibbin, HM Morgan AC ", " R Battellino, ML Edey ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 5 December 2006 were approved. "], "Board Member": [" Members congratulated Dr Henry on being awarded an AC in the 2007 Australia Day Honours List. "], "International Conditions": [" Discussion of international economic conditions commenced with an assessment of the momentum of growth of the US economy. While the US economy had been widely expected to slow to a below-trend pace, GDP figures for the December quarter and other recent indicators were relatively strong and suggested that there had been no significant slowing in overall growth over the past two years. In fact, GDP growth of 3½ per cent through 2006 remained slightly above trend and this could be a source of inflationary risk, which had been of concern to the Fed given the high level of resource utilisation in the economy. ", " In the housing sector, starts had begun to stabilise after a fall of over 25 per cent. However, it was too soon to determine whether more falls were likely given the current conditions of oversupply, and whether the sharp slowing in housing construction during 2006 would spread to other parts of the economy and dampen activity. At this stage, it appeared that growth in other sectors had remained relatively immune to conditions in the housing sector, and this suggested a lessening in the downside risks to prospects for growth. Inflation figures had indicated an easing in core inflation in recent months, from just below 3 per cent per annum to 2.6 per cent over the course of 2006. Headline inflation had been volatile, reflecting movements in oil prices, which had a large effect on gasoline prices in the CPI. ", " Growth in Japanese GDP in the September quarter had been revised from 2.7 per cent to 1.7 per cent. There had been no particular reason to explain the sharp downward revision, and the cyclical pattern of growth over the past couple of years had remained intact. The Tankan business survey continued to indicate strengthening conditions and suggested that the current expansion was continuing at a moderate pace. ", " In China, GDP growth through 2006 was above 10 per cent. This had been the fourth consecutive year of growth around that fast pace. In other parts of east Asia, the maturing of economies implied that growth rates were now cycling around a lower trend rate; GDP in Korea had increased by 4 per cent through 2006. ", " In Europe, the only country for which December quarter GDP figures were available was the UK. These data indicated a strong final quarter of growth in 2006 and GDP had increased by 3 per cent over the year. ", " Looking at the world economy as a whole, growth in 2006 was likely to have been 5¼ per cent, which was well above average. While growth was forecast to slow to 4¾ per cent in 2007, if realised this would be the fifth consecutive year of growth above the 30-year average; these forecasts did not yet incorporate the higher-than-expected US December quarter GDP figures. ", " The crude oil price had fallen sharply during the first half of January, to just above US$50 per barrel, but over recent weeks it had increased towards US$60 per barrel. The supply disruptions, security concerns in the Middle East and speculative excesses that had led to a peak in the oil price of above US$70 per barrel during the middle of 2006 had since been unwinding. "], "Domestic Conditions": [" GDP growth in the September quarter was 0.3 per cent. Members were informed that this differed from the estimate provided to the Board at the previous meeting, for growth of around ½ per cent, because stock-building had been lower than expected. Year-ended GDP growth of 2.2 per cent indicated that growth in the past few years had been cycling around a lower average than in the 1990s. With the drought affecting overall GDP growth, the non-farm economy had grown by 2.6 per cent over the year to the September quarter. ", " Members noted that a range of important questions arose from assessments of the true trend in productivity in the Australian economy, including those relating to potential growth and living standards. The latest national accounts indicated that productivity growth had been weak in recent years, with this evident from both aggregate and disaggregated sectoral data. Similar trends had been seen, though to a lesser extent, in the US and Canada, which also had puzzling strength in employment in the context of apparently weak productivity growth. The ABS was undertaking an internal inquiry into whether the national accounts have underestimated GDP in the past year or so, but it would be some time before the puzzles in the data were resolved. ", " Turning to the regular assessment of the flow of data since the previous meeting, retail sales had increased by just over 6 per cent through 2006. Annual growth in sales by large retailers had been higher than that for small retailers for most of the year, and steady at over 6 per cent. Growth in overall consumption had been supported by good growth in real disposable household income, which had been a bit below 4 per cent over the year to the September quarter. ", " In the housing sector, there had been little change in total building approvals in recent months and the downturn appeared to have troughed. A modest uptrend in residential building activity in the year ahead was expected, as approvals were running below underlying demand and the rental market was tightening, as seen by low and declining vacancy rates throughout the country. In addition, rents were rising, by just below 4 per cent per annum according to the CPI, and by 8 per cent for newly tenanted dwellings according to a measure compiled by the Real Estate Institute. The latter data revealed that Brisbane and Perth appeared to have the most severe shortages of rental accommodation, with rents for newly tenanted dwellings in those cities rising by well over 10 per cent per annum. ", " Business investment slowed sharply during 2006, to growth of around 5 per cent over the year to the September quarter, which followed rapid growth of 10–20 per cent per annum since 2002. Despite lower growth in the recent period, and the prospect of slower growth in domestic demand as a consequence, the level of investment as a share of GDP remained high, which would be adding to the capital stock. Business credit growth had slowed a little recently, but remained in the 15–20 per cent range, as businesses geared up after a long period of noticeably slower growth in borrowing. ", " Exports were estimated to have increased only moderately in volume terms in the December quarter, and by around 5 per cent over the year. Iron ore exports had increased steadily over the past few years, while coal exports had been relatively flat, with various infrastructure bottlenecks constraining growth. Oil exports had been on a falling trend until recently, but the opening of a new field had led to a pick-up in oil exports from mid 2006. Export receipts had increased more rapidly than volumes over the past few years given rising commodity prices. Import volumes were estimated to have risen strongly in the December quarter, and by around 10 per cent over the year. The estimates for growth in exports and imports in the December quarter implied that international trade would subtract significantly from output growth in the quarter, but the strength of imports suggested that there had been a pick-up in domestic demand towards the end of the year. ", " In the labour market, employment growth had been strong in both November and December, with growth of 3 per cent through 2006. The strong employment growth contrasted with the growth of GDP of 2.2 per cent over the year to the September quarter. As these two indicators provided opposing signals about the momentum of the economy, for the time being they needed to be treated carefully, with each signal interpreted on its merits, including how it tied in with other indicators. The unemployment rate was 4.6 per cent at the end of 2006, a 30-year low, and the participation rate had risen noticeably over the course of the year. In a further sign of tightness in the labour market, job vacancies had increased to 1.5 per cent of the labour force, which was the highest rate since the 1970s. ", " The CPI indicated that prices fell by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter and year-ended inflation declined to 3.3 per cent. The easing in inflation pressures had been expected with petrol and banana prices both falling sharply in the quarter. In underlying terms, inflation had increased from 2½ per cent at the end of 2005 to around 3 per cent in the September quarter 2006, where it had remained in the final quarter of the year. On a quarterly basis, underlying inflation peaked at 0.9 per cent in the June quarter and had slowed to 0.5 per cent in the December quarter. Price rises were less common than price falls in the December quarter: around 40 per cent of the items in the CPI by weight rose by more than 2.5 per cent in the quarter, compared with over 60 per cent around mid 2006. While input price pressures remained high, the staff forecast was for underlying inflation to decline gradually to 2¾ per cent over the coming year. "], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": [" The past year was favourable for financial markets, with strong rises in share prices, low bond yields, tight credit spreads and generally low volatility. These developments reflected the healthy state of the world economy. However, some signs of increased risk-taking in financial markets had begun to emerge. While this was not threatening at present, its continuation could pose risks. In particular, most countries had experienced a large increase in mergers and acquisitions activity, notably leveraged buy-outs. Developments in China also needed to be monitored as the authorities were struggling to offset the domestic liquidity effects of their massive intervention in the foreign exchange market. ", " Turing to individual markets, share prices in the US rose by around 15 per cent in 2006, which was the fourth consecutive year of strong returns. This rise took the market to within 5 per cent of the peak in 2000. Share markets in other developed countries had also been strong in 2006, apart from Japan, where the market had been relatively flat following a very strong year in 2005. Emerging market share prices, particularly in Latin America, had been even stronger than those in the major countries. The strength was the result of a combination of improving economic conditions and a general increase in risk appetite in global markets. The fact that volatility in share markets in recent years had been about half its long-run average was encouraging investors to move into some risky assets. ", " Bond yields had risen slightly over the past year or so, but remained low by historical standards. In the English-speaking countries and most of Asia, longer-term yields were lower than the respective cash rates, i.e. yield curves were inverted. This was a result of strong demand for bonds, including by Asian and Middle Eastern central banks. In the US, bond yields had not changed in net terms since mid 2004, though the Fed funds rate had risen significantly over that period. ", " Credit spreads on non-government bonds had continued to tighten, as a result of the search for yield and increased risk appetite. This had occurred against a backdrop of very low default rates on speculative debt; despite the narrowing, spreads were such that investors were being adequately compensated as long as these low levels of defaults continued. In previous cycles, however, default rates on low-rated debt had increased to around 10–13 per cent when economic conditions deteriorated, well above current rates. ", " Central banks had increased cash rates during 2006. In the US, the Fed had restored the Fed funds rate to 5¼ per cent, which is a relatively normal level, and the economy was growing at a moderate pace. Although markets through the second half of 2006 had been expecting significant easing by the Fed during 2007, at present no change in the funds rate was expected over the next six months. The ECB still had the cash rate a little below normal, and markets expected some further tightening in the next few months. Short-term interest rates in Japan were still close to zero and continued to provide a source of cheap funding for global markets. ", " The US dollar fell in 2006 following a rise in 2005, but in net terms had shown little change over the past two years, and was about 25 per cent below its peak in 2002. ", " The yen had been very weak in recent years, and was one of the few currencies that fell against the US dollar. Since its peak in the mid 1990s, the yen had fallen by about 40 per cent, measured in real trade-weighted terms. ", " The exchange rate of the Chinese currency increased by 3 per cent against the US dollar in 2006. However, as this was less than the extent of the fall in the US dollar against other currencies, in trade-weighted terms the Chinese currency remained low. The Chinese authorities had been purchasing US$20–30 billion per month of foreign exchange to prevent the exchange rate from rising, which had led to problems in the domestic financial system, including a sharp rise in liquidity and rising prices of shares and other assets. The Chinese share market rose by 150 per cent in 2006, with most of the rise occurring in the second half of the year. ", " During 2006, foreign reserves accumulation by Middle Eastern central banks, which mostly manage fixed exchange rates, was almost as large as the accumulation by the People's Bank of China. Other countries in Asia also increased their accumulation of reserves in 2006. ", " In Thailand, a range of measures were recently announced to try to prevent capital inflow and encourage capital outflow, in order to stop the exchange rate from rising. The main effect had been on the share market, which fell sharply late in 2006. ", " Share prices in Australia rose by about 20 per cent in 2006. As was the case in several other countries, this was the fourth consecutive year of strong returns. While resource shares were flat overall in 2006, share prices in other sectors rose. Over the longer term, share prices in Australia had been more stable than in the US, particularly around the turn of the century, where the US experienced a boom and bust period. Recent rises in share prices in both countries had been supported by higher profits, and price-earnings ratios had, if anything, fallen. ", " The strength in profits in Australia in recent years had surprised company analysts, who have had to revise up their profit estimates through the course of most years. Some easing in resource sector profits had meant that forecasts for profits in the current financial year were no longer being revised up, but forecasts for 2007/08 were still rising, with the current average forecast for 8 per cent profit growth. ", " Mergers and acquisitions activity in Australia had been increasing, and involved 10 per cent of the share market in 2006, which was the highest since 2001 and about twice the average rate. Within this, leveraged buy-out activity was particularly strong, as it was in several other countries. The increase in the level of these activities was being driven by the low cost of debt and high return on equity. The market response to the increase in leveraged buy-out activity had been a sharp increase in the spreads on target companies' debt, because of the associated increase in gearing and reduction in credit quality. ", " Turning to the Australian money market, earlier in the year markets had been pricing the probability of a tightening in monetary policy at the February Board meeting at 50 per cent. However, this expectation largely dissipated following release of the lower-than-expected CPI data for the December quarter. ", " Banks' lending rates for housing had increased following the November tightening, and it appeared that the incidence of discounting had stabilised. Virtually all borrowers were now paying less than the indicator rate. ", " The Australian dollar had risen late last year and early in 2007, towards the top of its range for the past three years, but fell back following the CPI data. The Australian dollar was now 10 per cent above its long-run average in terms of both the US dollar and the trade-weighted index. Overall, the exchange rate had been very stable, with the range in the TWI in 2006 the second lowest on record. The Australian dollar had increased by about 50 per cent against the yen over the past five years, to its highest level since prior to the Asian financial crisis. ", " With the higher exchange rate, the Bank had stepped up slightly the rate at which it had been buying foreign exchange, to around $200 million per month. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change in the cash rate in February. ", " The data on the US economy in the past couple of months suggested that growth had remained above trend and the downside risks had eased. Overall, the world economy was expected to grow a little more slowly in 2007 than in 2006, but still at an above-average pace. While growth of the Australian economy was well below trend up to the September quarter, and had been adversely affected by the drought, conditions in the labour market were healthy and aggregate income continued to be supported by high commodity prices. The high level of capacity utilisation had led to a pick-up in inflationary pressures earlier in the year. ", " The CPI data for the December quarter were below expectations and suggested that underlying inflation had been contained to around 3 per cent over the year. Importantly, underlying inflation was lower in the second half of 2006 than in the first half. The latest information on economic activity and producer and consumer prices gave Board members a little more confidence in the forecast, first enunciated following the November policy tightening, that underlying inflation would decline to around 2¾ per cent over the next year or so. ", " While members noted that the most likely outlook for inflation would be for it to be consistent with the target of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span>, they were still wary of possible inflation risks. Although the forecast for output growth in the year ahead had been lowered slightly, capacity utilisation remained high, which implied there was still some risk that the inflation pressure evident in much of 2006 could re-emerge if demand proved to be stronger than expected. Despite the well-behaved nature of wages growth to date, reports of strengthening wage pressures in an environment of an apparent slowing of productivity growth also posed a possible inflationary risk. This meant that it was appropriate for the monetary policy stance to remain mildly restrictive, but members did not see a case for a further tightening at present. The Board decided to leave the cash rate steady, but would monitor incoming data and adjust policy as necessary to ensure that inflation remained satisfactorily contained in the medium term. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.25 per cent. "]}},

"], "International Economic Conditions": [" There had been little change in the outlook for the world economy since the previous Board meeting. In the US, recent data indicated a slight downward revision to the initial estimate of quarterly GDP growth for the March quarter. The slowdown in growth to 2 per cent was mainly due to the downturn in the housing sector; excluding this sector, annual growth was a bit over 3 per cent, which was above trend and suggested that the performance of the other sectors of the US economy remained solid. ", " Some indicators of housing activity in the US had shown signs of stabilising, following the one-third fall in housing construction since the peak in late 2005 and early 2006. However, it was still too early to determine if the trough in the housing cycle had been reached. If there were no further falls in the leading indicators of housing activity, namely permits to build and starts, then the volume of work done could be expected to stabilise later in the year. Members noted that the level of housing starts was now low enough to start eroding stocks of unsold houses. ", " Housing prices in the US had softened further over recent months, which had dampened sentiment, but members commented that it was likely that the negative wealth effects from this source would be offset to some extent by recent further gains in the share market. It was also encouraging that there had been no broader financial spillover from the problems in the sub-prime mortgage market earlier in the year. In fact, while volatility in the data made interpretation difficult, there appeared to be an uptrend in mortgage applications, indicating increased demand for housing. ", " The Japanese economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter, and more recent data on business investment suggested that upward revisions to that figure were likely. Year-ended growth had remained steady at over 2 per cent. Members noted that this was relatively high for a mature economy such as Japan, which had a declining labour force. ", " In China, growth in industrial production over the year to April had been rapid. These data, along with most other economic indicators, suggested that the pace of growth had continued to increase. Despite little sign of an increase in inflation, the authorities were concerned about overheating in the economy and had taken several steps to tighten policy settings. ", " The Indian economy had recorded growth of 9 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Growth had increased to around that pace in the past few years following the period of economic reform and deregulation in the 1990s. India was of growing importance in the world economy, representing about 6 per cent of world GDP on a purchasing power parity basis. There were strong and growing links with the Australian business sector and India now accounted for 5 per cent of Australia's exports. Members expressed some concern that widespread infrastructure problems might crimp India's future growth prospects. ", " Growth in the euro area had picked up in the past few years. The most recent data showed GDP growth of around 3 per cent. Recently, there were some signs of slowing in the pace of activity and these were also apparent in the sentiment indicators, but the overall pace still appeared likely to remain firm this year. ", " Members noted that the slowing in the US, coupled with the good growth in China and pick-up in Japan and the euro area over recent years, had left the average growth of Australia's trading partners at a little below 5 per cent. The favourable outcome was about the same as the strong outcomes in the past few years. Above-average growth was expected to continue. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The domestic economy at present was characterised by strong growth and relatively contained inflationary pressures. While the National Accounts for the March quarter would not be released until the day following the Board meeting, members were informed that data already published on the important components indicated that the strong growth recorded in the December quarter would persist into the March quarter. The outcome for year-ended growth would be higher than the estimate of around 3½ per cent that had been included in the Board paper. ", " Turning to the detail of the regular data releases over the past month, retail sales had increased modestly in April following a run of strong increases early in the year. The annual rate of growth, which had been rising over the past 18 months, had reached 7 per cent. Consumer sentiment had improved in May following the Budget, reaching the highest level in the history of the series. Sentiment had been on an upward trend since the middle of 2006. Motor vehicle sales had levelled out in the past few months, but were 8 per cent higher than the average level in 2006. ", " In the housing sector, activity indicators showed that the falls in building approvals over the past year had not been reflected commensurately in building work done. Apart from the typical lag between the approval and commencement of building work, over recent years there had been a tendency towards larger and better quality housing being built and there had also been fewer cancellations than usual. ", " In the secondary housing market, recent data suggested that house prices in April had remained broadly flat in Sydney after a period of decline; they had levelled out in Perth after rising rapidly over the past few years, and continued to rise in the other capitals. Although these house price measures were adjusted for compositional change, the most recent monthly figures were still subject to revision. ", " Members noted the contrast between the top and bottom ends of the Sydney housing market. House prices in the cheapest suburbs had peaked later than the rest of the market in 2004, but had fallen noticeably since and were continuing to do so. Prices at the top end, in contrast, had begun to increase again recently. The prolonged correction in lower-end house prices (essentially those in the south-western part of Sydney) had gone hand in hand with more subdued economic conditions in that part of Sydney as well. ", " Members discussed different approaches to measuring housing affordability, following release of the CBA/HIA measure, which suggested that affordability had reached a record low point in the March quarter. This measure embodied various assumptions that were used to determine the income required to buy an average house, the price of which was derived from the CBA's housing loan book. It appeared to overstate the decline in affordability because the CBA house price series had increased significantly more than median house prices. An alternative measure of affordability, using a broader nationwide series for house prices and better data on household incomes, also indicated that affordability had been declining, but not to a record low point. In the rental housing market, rents for newly tenanted dwellings, which were published by the Real Estate Institute, had been rising strongly; the measure of rents in the CPI, which covers all rental properties, had risen more slowly. ", " Total credit growth had remained relatively steady at just under 15 per cent over the year to April. Members noted that for the first time in a decade business credit was growing significantly faster than household credit, growth of which had slowed over the past year to about 12 per cent per annum. Growth in business credit was 19 per cent, though business gearing in aggregate was still conservative. Members discussed current risks in the financial sector, and whether they had risen due to the relatively low cost of debt and easy availability of finance in recent years. They observed that it was now sometimes difficult to know who was bearing risk. They also noted, however, that the greater dispersion of financial risks in the current environment, compared with earlier periods where these risks were mainly held in the banking system, had probably made the financial system more resilient to shocks. ", " The wage price index had increased by 1 per cent in the March quarter, with the year-ended rate rising only slightly to 4.1 per cent. The pattern of increases in recent quarters had been affected by the changed timing of the minimum wage increase. Allowing for this effect suggested that the underlying pace of wages growth had been slightly lower than expected. Wage rises associated with enterprise bargains concluded in the March quarter were 4 per cent in total, with no change in the recent pace of growth of wages in the private and public sectors. These increases were a little lower than seen in the past couple of years. ", " Members discussed how changes to wage-determination arrangements in Australia over the past decade or more may be contributing to restrained growth in wages in the face of strong growth of the economy and tightness of the labour market. This was the subject of an Information Paper prepared for members, assessing wage developments from a longer-run perspective. Key changes to wage-setting arrangements since the early 1990s had involved moving towards decentralised wage-setting at the enterprise or individual level, away from a centralised system based on ‘comparative wage justice’. ", " Other important factors that had restrained wages growth over recent years had been higher labour-force participation, better anchored price and wage expectations, and product market deregulation, which had led to an increase in competition in the economy. However, it was difficult to determine the relative importance of each of these factors in the overall picture. It was also difficult to assess the effect on wage outcomes and labour supply of recent legislative changes, including the Work Choices legislation of 2006. Members noted that the phenomenon of modest wage pressures despite a tight labour market was also a feature of economic conditions in several other advanced economies at present, which suggested that global developments associated with the international economic integration of China and India had been important contributing factors. Taken together, these factors had allowed the economy to grow more than would otherwise have been possible without generating a significant lift in inflation. The scope for further sustainable reductions in unemployment remained uncertain however, and it would be important to continue monitoring wage and labour market developments given the current evidence of labour scarcity. ", " In commenting on the current drought, members observed that rainfall in 2007 to date was around average, though the critical months for rainfall for the winter crop season were yet to come. They noted that while water allocations from the Murray-Darling system were at risk without significant further rainfall, the rainfall in some of the key areas in April and May had been encouraging. The highest inflows into the Murray-Darling system typically occurred in August and September. "], "Financial Markets": [" There had been no change in monetary policy over the past month among the three major economies. However, the European Central Bank was expected to tighten policy at its meeting later in the week, which would take the policy interest rate to 4 per cent; a further tightening was expected later in the year. The Bank of Japan was expected to tighten some time in the next six months. Market expectations in the US, which over the past year had been for a cut in the federal funds rate by the end of 2007, had moved back towards no change in monetary policy for the rest of the year. The Bank of England had raised interest rates in May and markets expected further increases by the end of the year. ", " As market expectations of an easing in monetary policy by the Fed had unwound, bond yields in the US had increased and, at just below 5 per cent, were at their highest level in a year. Bond yields had also risen in Germany, to the highest level since 2004. ", " Major foreign exchange rates had not shown much movement over the past month. The US dollar had remained around its lows against the euro, and the yen had continued to depreciate against the US dollar and other currencies. Several currencies had reached new multi-year highs against the US dollar. The Canadian dollar was at a 30-year high, reflecting a heightened expectation of a near-term interest rate increase by the Bank of Canada. ", " Share prices in major equity markets had continued to record solid gains over the past month, with the exception of Japan, where weakness in financial stocks had limited overall gains in the market. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 rose to an all-time high during May, surpassing the previous peak seven years earlier, but the NASDAQ, which has a higher weight in technology stocks, was still about 50 per cent below the peak in 2000. Share prices in emerging markets had also increased strongly during May. ", " Board members spent some time discussing the structure of, and the latest developments in, the Chinese share market. It was noted that foreign participation in the China A market, by far the main domestic market, was limited. The strong rises in this market this year were mainly driven by domestic investors; the number of such investors participating in the market and the size of their turnover had both risen sharply. Members noted that the Chinese market was the second largest in absolute size in Asia, behind Japan, but was quite small in international comparative terms relative to GDP. Foreign investors were largely limited to the China B market, which was relatively small and denominated in foreign currency. ", " Since the start of June, the China A market had fallen by 15 per cent and the fall in the China B market had been twice that amount. Prior to these falls, the China A market had risen by 150 per cent over the preceding year and the China B market had risen by more than 200 per cent. Indications were that price-earnings ratios in China were still well above those of share markets in developed countries. ", " The Chinese authorities had adopted several policy measures in an attempt to reduce the speculative excesses in the equity market and to slow the pace of economic activity. In terms of monetary policy, the authorities had raised reserve requirements steadily over the past year and lifted lending and deposit rates. In addition, there had been an increase in stamp duty on share trading, which appeared to have been the proximate cause of the recent falls in share prices. Members observed that, because of the limited foreign participation in the Chinese market, there was not likely to be any direct contagion from the developments in that market to major share markets; any link would be based largely on sentiment. ", " In the foreign exchange market, the Chinese authorities had widened the maximum trading band for the renminbi against the US dollar, from 0.3 per cent to 0.5 per cent per day, even though the previous limit had not been tested since its introduction in July 2005. ", " The Australian dollar had fallen a little in May from its recent highs in terms of the US dollar and the TWI, but more recently had risen again. In trade-weighted terms, the exchange rate had increased slightly since the previous Board meeting. The currency had reached above 101 yen, the highest since early 1992. ", " The Australian share market had recorded solid and broad-based gains in May, with the overall market up by almost 13 per cent for the year to date. ", " The domestic 10-year bond yield had moved up in line with movements in global bond yields, and was above 6 per cent for the first time since 2004. Members noted that several high-profile proposed private-equity offers had been withdrawn or had been rejected. ", " Market expectations were for no change in monetary policy in Australia in June, though they indicated a strong possibility of a tightening by the end of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change to the cash rate in June. ", " In discussing the recommendation, Board members noted that conditions facing the Australian economy were still favourable. The world economy was growing strongly, with the slowdown in growth of the US having had little effect elsewhere thus far, and high commodity prices had led to further increases in Australia's terms of trade. Domestically, the indications were that demand and activity had increased at a strong pace in the March quarter, but domestic price and wage pressures had remained contained. ", " Members noted the staff forecast that underlying inflation would remain around 2½ per cent in 2007 but rise in 2008 due to the strength in economic activity and tightness of the labour market. They also noted, however, that the improved short-term outlook meant that any pick-up in inflation would start from a lower base than earlier expected. Members concluded that maintaining the current mildly restrictive stance of monetary policy for the time being would leave policy with adequate flexibility to respond as needed to the medium-term risks. Members decided, therefore, that no change to the cash rate was necessary at this meeting. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.25 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 3 July 2007"], "Text": {"Present": [" GR Stevens (Chairman), R Battellino, KR Henry AC, JR Broadbent AO, RC Corbett AM, GJ Kraehe AO, DG McGauchie AO, WJ McKibbin, HM Morgan AC ", " GL Debelle, DW Orsmond ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 5 June 2007 were approved. "], "Board Member": [" The Governor noted that this was Mr Morgan's final meeting after a combined period of almost 14 years covering four terms, with his first beginning some 26 years ago. Throughout his period as a Board member, he made an outstanding contribution as a consistent and forceful advocate for sound monetary policy. His extensive commercial experience and specialised knowledge had been of great value to the Board's deliberations and was highly appreciated by the five Governors with whom he had worked. Members wished him well in the future. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Board members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by reviewing the national accounts for the March quarter, which were released the day following the previous Board meeting. Growth in both aggregate and non-farm output had been higher than expected. Following the strong outcome in the December quarter and upward revisions to earlier periods, and a smaller fall in farm output in the March quarter than had been expected, GDP growth over the year to the March quarter was 3.8 per cent. Non-farm output increased by 4.6 per cent over the year, with strength in most major components in the most recent quarter. ", " Domestic demand growth over the year to the March quarter had been 4¼ per cent, which was firm but lower than in recent years, and the gap between demand and output had narrowed. The composition of spending had changed in the past two years; initially, investment had picked up as the pace of consumption and dwelling activity had slowed but, more recently, these trends had started to reverse. ", " Members were informed that, in the staff's judgment, part of the recent strength in the national accounts was likely to be payback from weakness earlier in 2006 and that the pace of growth from the June quarter onwards would probably ease. It was noted that the quarterly pattern of growth presented by the national accounts was subject to measurement error and subsequent revision, and that in the past year or so these data may have exaggerated both the slowing and then the pick-up in growth. Survey measures of business conditions and labour market data suggested that the pace of growth had varied by less than indicated in the national accounts. ", " The stronger growth in output implied an increase in the rate of growth of productivity, which was measured at a little above 2 per cent over the year to the March quarter, compared with the longer-run average of around 1¾ per cent. The higher rate of productivity growth was a consequence of the figures for GDP growth and employment growth coming more into line, following a period where employment growth had been considerably more rapid than output growth. Looking at longer-run movements in productivity growth, members discussed the possible reasons for the higher growth in the second half of the 1990s relative to earlier periods. One explanation was the possibility that it had taken a long time for the effects of the microeconomic reform measures that had been introduced from the early 1980s to permeate through the economy and thereby show up in data on activity. ", " Turning to the regular data releases over the past month, it was noted that there had been no new retail sales figures following the modest increase reported for April, though information from the Bank's liaison contacts had suggested firm trading conditions recently. Motor vehicle sales had fallen a little in April and May, though this had followed a strong March quarter. ", " Strength in consumer spending in recent months had been supported by rapid growth in household disposable income, which had increased in real terms by around 2 per cent in the March quarter and 6 per cent over the year. The income growth had been underpinned by strong labour market income growth and increases in earnings on household financial assets. ", " In the housing sector, the cyclical downturn had been mild by past standards and some of the leading indicators of activity were starting to pick up somewhat. The current supply of 12,000 dwellings per month, judging from data on private building approvals, was below estimates of underlying demand of around 15,000 per month, with the growing excess demand expected to underpin prospects for future growth in housing construction activity. Members commented that there was some doubt as to whether there was the capacity to increase housing construction further given the demand on resources for non-residential construction, which was running at a high level, and by state government plans to increase public infrastructure spending. ", " House prices had increased in the past few months in all the capital cities except Perth, where they had levelled out after rapid rises over the past few years. The increase in most cities was concentrated in the most expensive suburbs; in Sydney, however, prices were rising only in suburbs in the middle of the price distribution, with the top end flat and prices in the cheapest suburbs still flat or falling. There were some signs of increasing mortgage arrears, which implied that the housing correction was continuing in some parts of the largest cities. ", " Looking at credit growth, while housing loan approvals and lending credit growth had increased a little in recent months, the rate for both series was below that seen in recent years. Business credit, on the other hand, was rising at an annual rate of close to 20 per cent over the six months to May, the fastest in almost two decades. Members discussed whether it was appropriate to characterise policy settings as ‘mildly restrictive’, agreeing that it was. The Governor undertook to have a further analysis for the next meeting. ", " Business investment had increased by about 4 per cent over the year to the March quarter (excluding the effect of the reclassification of Telstra from the public to the private sector in the March quarter). Although this was well below the average rate of growth of 15 per cent in the previous four years, the current share of investment in GDP was high and this implied growth of the net capital stock of around 6 per cent per annum. ", " In the external sector, annual growth in export volumes was strong at about 7 per cent in all components in the March quarter except rural exports, which fell because of the drought. Import volumes rose sharply in both the December and March quarters because of strong growth in domestic demand. ", " The current account deficit had fluctuated between 5 and 6 per cent of GDP in the past few years, with the latest observation a little below 6 per cent. Over this period the trade deficit had narrowed, reflecting the rising terms of trade and pick-up in export volumes, but this had been offset by a widening in the net income deficit, which had left the current account deficit broadly stable as a share of GDP. The widening in the net income deficit had arisen because of higher interest payments on foreign debt and higher dividend transfers abroad; as these payments were typically reinvested in Australia, they were also recorded in the balance of payments statistics as inflows on the financial account. ", " The terms of trade were estimated to have increased by about 2 per cent in the June quarter, following a rise of 1 per cent in the March quarter. Base metals prices had fallen back in the past few months from very high levels, with this mainly reflecting the trend in nickel prices. The latest expectations for next year's price increases for bulk commodity contracts had been revised up for both iron ore and coking coal. ", " Oil prices had risen over the past month, to around US$70 per barrel for WTI crude. Members discussed the relationship between WTI and Malaysian (Tapis) crude prices, noting that the former was the global benchmark while the latter was the relevant benchmark for the Asia-Pacific region and Australian petrol prices. The price of Tapis crude had been high, and this had been an important contributor to higher domestic petrol prices in Australia. The margin between WTI and Tapis crude prices had widened a few months ago, reflecting refining capacity outages in the US that had reduced the demand for WTI crude, though some of this was in the process of being reversed. ", " Rural output was expected to bounce back strongly in 2007/08, following the breaking of the drought. The latest projections from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics suggested that growth of 130 per cent would take winter crop production above the average of the five years preceding the most recent drought. Although the eastern states had benefited from widespread rainfall providing a good start to the winter cropping season, members commented that the projections may be optimistic given the poor conditions in Western Australia and the likely cut-backs to water allocations from the Murray-Darling system. ", " Labour market conditions were again strong in May. Year-ended growth in employment of over 3 per cent was coupled with a fall in the unemployment rate to 4.2 per cent, which was the lowest level since 1974, and a rise in the participation rate to its highest in at least 60 years. A rising employment-to-population ratio, coupled with population growth (including higher migration), had driven overall employment growth in recent years. Members noted that growth in the working age population was expected to peak in the next year or so. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The outlook for the world economy had remained favourable since the previous Board meeting. Consensus forecasts for growth in 2007 and 2008 had been revised up noticeably since earlier in the year. The outlook for the G7 economies was relatively stable, with a forecast slowing in the US offset by upward revisions to the outlook for the euro area and Japan. China and other emerging economies were expected to grow faster in both years. ", " In the US, the latest data suggested little change in current conditions. Housing permits and starts were around one-third below their peaks. The lower level of activity was leading to some reduction in excess housing stocks, but this was a gradual process and the weaker conditions in the housing sector were likely to last longer than previously expected. However, other indicators of activity and spending in the economy had remained quite solid. ", " In other countries, conditions were broadly similar to those presented to the Board at the previous meeting. Business sentiment in Japan had remained steady at relatively high levels. Industrial production in China was continuing to increase at a fast pace, while production and export growth in east Asian economies had slowed over the past six months, having been adversely affected by the slowing in the US. The latest data for the euro area suggested that growth had moderated but remained relatively firm, and sentiment among businesses and consumers had remained high. "], "Outlook for the Australian Economy": [" The near-term outlook for the Australian economy was for the pace of quarterly growth in demand and output to be lower than the rapid pace seen in the December and March quarters, with non-farm GDP expected to grow at an annualised rate of about 3¾ per cent over the two-year horizon, which was somewhat above trend. Growth in total GDP would be higher next year as it would be boosted by the expected bounce-back in farm output in 2007/08, but thereafter was expected to be at around the same rate as non-farm GDP growth. ", " The past couple of quarterly outturns for underlying inflation had been lower than expected, with a year-ended rate of about 2½ per cent expected for the June quarter. Pending a review of the forecast for inflation to be undertaken following receipt of the June quarter CPI in late July, the outlook was for underlying inflation to rise slightly towards 2¾ per cent by the end of the forecast period. The increase was expected to be driven by current and forecast strong demand pressures and high levels of capacity utilisation, including in the labour market, though members noted that wages growth had been relatively stable in the period up to the March quarter. A sizeable increase in the headline CPI was expected for the June quarter, given recent higher petrol prices, but this would nonetheless be lower than the figure a year earlier, which had spiked up following the effect of Cyclone Larry on banana prices. This implied that the year-ended rate of CPI inflation would drop to around, or a bit below, 2 per cent in the June and September quarters, after which it was expected gradually to reach the same rate as that for underlying inflation. "], "Financial Markets": [" In the major economies, monetary policy had not changed in the US and in Japan. The European Central Bank had tightened policy in June, as expected, and a further tightening was expected later in the year. In other countries, policy rates were raised in Switzerland, Sweden and New Zealand. The Bank of England, and possibly the Bank of Canada, were expected to tighten policy at their next meetings. ", " Members noted that there had been a noticeable change in market expectations about future Fed policy moves over recent months. Expectations of an easing, which had persisted for much of the past year, had recently dissipated, and no change in the Fed policy rate was now expected before the end of the year. To that extent, markets now appeared to be more in line with Fed thinking. Over the past year, Fed commentary had generally expressed concerns about inflation. ", " As a consequence of the market's reassessment of the outlook for short-term interest rates, longer-term bond yields had increased further over the past month. While US bond yields had risen by as much as 60 basis points at one stage during the month, by the end of June the net rise was only 15 basis points, to around 5 per cent. While there had been much media and market commentary during the past month about the significance of these moves, members noted that they were considerably smaller than those in some earlier episodes, for example in 1994. Members concluded that the recent rise in yields reflected a less pessimistic assessment of prospects for the real economy rather than higher inflation expectations, which had remained relatively stable. ", " Yields on lower-rated US debt instruments had risen more than those on government bonds, indicating a widening in corporate spreads. Spreads on emerging market debt, however, had not widened. ", " New data on mortgage delinquencies in the US for the March quarter showed a rise to about 14 per cent for sub-prime loans, but there had been little change in the proportion of prime loans that were delinquent; this remained low. Rising sub-prime delinquencies were reflected also in the foreclosure rate, which had risen in recent months and was expected to rise further. There had also been a tightening of credit standards in mortgage lending to individuals, particularly for the sub-prime component, according to a survey by the Fed. ", " The current problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market had led to significant falls in the share prices of sub-prime lenders. Members discussed the effect of the problems in the sub-prime market on Bear Stearns, which had occasioned much commentary in the financial media of late. The Bear Stearns share price had fallen somewhat and its reputation had been damaged as a consequence of its involvement in, and support of, two highly leveraged funds which had incurred large losses by investing in the sub-prime market. ", " While it was too early to judge the broader significance of these developments, it was noted that a number of debt raisings by leveraged firms had been withdrawn, due to lack of investor demand. Members agreed some tightening in credit conditions was, on balance, a healthy development. ", " Turning to share markets generally, rising bond yields had led to a soft month for global share markets. However, emerging markets had seen another strong month, though the Chinese market had been volatile. In Australia, the share market had fallen slightly after 10 consecutive monthly increases and was still one of the strongest markets around the world for the year to date. Resource share prices in particular had been strong, supporting an increase in the overall market of 24 per cent over the past financial year. Mergers and acquisitions activity among listed Australian entities had remained strong, though this could be affected by tightening credit standards in due course. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the yen had continued to depreciate, particularly against the euro, with the fall driven by the effect of carry trades and capital outflows associated with investment abroad by Japanese households. Despite Japan's economic upswing in the past few years, the yen had depreciated substantially in both nominal and real effective terms. ", " The NZ dollar had recorded a post-float high against the US dollar in June, as New Zealand had been the recipient of funds associated with carry trades. The RBNZ had intervened in the foreign exchange market following a sharp rise in the NZ dollar in New York trading early in June. This had had an immediate effect in producing a fall in the exchange rate and injecting some two-way risk in the exchange rate, but the currency had subsequently appreciated again. There had been several more episodes of intervention later in the month. ", " Members were briefed on financial conditions in New Zealand in some detail. The RBNZ had been tightening monetary policy for some time, but this had been slow to flow through to longer-term mortgage rates because of large capital inflows into the New Zealand bond market. As fixed-rate mortgages were more prevalent than variable mortgage rates in that country, this had blunted the impact of monetary policy, at least in relation to housing. It appeared that rising bond yields over the past month may finally have started to deliver the tightening sought by the central bank. Members noted that, to date, house prices in New Zealand had continued to rise strongly in the face of tighter monetary policy, but house building had slowed. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated further over the past month, to be higher against all currencies in the trade-weighted basket except the NZ dollar. New multi-year highs had been reached against the US dollar and yen, and in trade-weighted terms, during June. Over the past year, the Australian dollar had risen by about 10 per cent overall, though it had depreciated against the NZ dollar. Compared with its post-float average, the dollar was high relative to the US dollar and Asian currencies, around average against European currencies, the pound and Canadian dollar, and below average against the NZ dollar. Measured in terms of the TWI, it was about 20 per cent above the post-float average. ", " Market expectations were for no change in monetary policy in Australia in July, but the stronger data for economic activity in the past month had pushed up expectations of a policy tightening by the end of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change to the cash rate in July. ", " In discussing the recommendation, Board members noted that the outlook for the world economy remained favourable. There were some dampening factors affecting the outlook for the US economy, but these had had little effect elsewhere thus far, and global economic growth was expected to continue at an above-average pace next year. ", " On the domestic economy, members noted that the strength exhibited in the recent national accounts probably exaggerated the lift in growth. Nonetheless, it was clear from the assessment of all recent data that there had been some strengthening in demand and activity. This was reflected in the revised forecasts by the staff, which showed higher growth in GDP in the coming year. No new price or wage data had been received during the past month. In short, the economic configuration facing the Board continued to be strong demand and output, declining unemployment, steady wages and moderating inflation. The forces that produced this favourable combination of events were still not clear. A key issue was whether they were the result of the economy's capacity having expanded to a greater extent than earlier indicated. The prices data for the June quarter, scheduled for release in late July, would be a key piece of information in assessing the relative expansion of demand and supply. ", " For the present, the staff forecast continued to point to inflation rising to 2¾ per cent in 2008, owing to strength in activity and labour market tightness. The recent strength in activity suggested that the upside risks to this forecast may have increased, though the appreciation of the exchange rate would be a dampening factor. It also remained the case that any pick-up in inflation would start from a lower base than expected six months earlier. ", " Taking all these considerations into account, members believed that tighter policy could well be needed before long. But, on balance, they judged the current mildly restrictive stance of monetary policy should be maintained for the time being, pending further information on inflation, which would be available at the August meeting. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.25 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 2 October 2007"], "Text": {"Present": [" GR Stevens (Chairman), R Battellino, KR Henry AC, JH Akehurst, JR Broadbent AO, RC Corbett AM, DG McGauchie AO, WJ McKibbin ", " Members granted leave of absence to GJ Kraehe AO in terms of section 18A of the <cite>Reserve Bank Act 1959.</cite> ", " GL Debelle, ML Edey ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 4 September 2007 were approved. "], "Board Member": [" Members congratulated Mr Akehurst on his appointment to the Board and welcomed him to his first meeting. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The Board's discussion of the world economy commenced with an update on the latest preliminary forecasts produced by the IMF. Since July, when the previous set of forecasts was prepared, there had been a small downward revision to expected world growth in 2008. The final forecast to be released this month may be a bit lower again, with most of the adjustment likely to reflect a delay in the recovery of the US economy rather than any further slowing. Even with these downward revisions, the forecast indicated that 2008 was expected to be the sixth consecutive year of above average growth in the world economy. ", " The United States economy had slowed to a 2 per cent per annum pace. Growth was set to remain at that rate for the next few quarters as the expected pick-up in activity had been pushed out. The main source of weakness had been the housing sector, which accounted for about 5 per cent of overall activity. The most recent figures for the leading indicators of housing activity had continued to fall, with no clear sign of a cyclical trough, which had previously been expected around mid year. In addition, house prices were falling, with the Case-Shiller index of monthly repeat-sales, derived from sales of houses in the 20 largest cities, now 5 per cent below its peak in 2006. Members considered that a dynamic in the housing sector was at play, in which people were reluctant to enter the market to build or purchase new homes so long as prices were falling. The stock of unsold new homes had peaked, but the fact the stock-to-sales ratio was still high suggested that a recovery in housing construction was still some way off. Labour market conditions in the United States had begun to soften in the past few months, with a fall in non-farm payrolls in August and downward revisions to the growth in payrolls in the preceding two months. Nevertheless, employment growth over the past year had been 1.2 per cent, which was sufficient to keep the unemployment rate broadly stable over that period. ", " In Japan, economic data had been volatile in recent months, making it difficult to obtain a clear sense of the pace of growth. The latest Tankan survey on business sentiment, conducted by the Bank of Japan, indicated that sentiment remained above average in the September quarter, but was below recent high levels. Overall, it appeared that growth was reasonable but the momentum had slowed recently. Employment growth was firm, at around 1½ per cent, and the unemployment rate had been trending down. The CPI continued to fall by around ¼–½ per cent per annum. ", " The Chinese economy had not showed any signs of slowing in the past few months. Industrial production was increasing at more than 17 per cent a year. China now accounted for around 15 per cent of world GDP on a purchasing power parity basis, about the same as for the euro area, and was the single largest contributor to global GDP growth at present. Members noted that there were increasing limits to the continued rapid growth of the Chinese economy, which bore watching. These included pollution, rapidly rising wages for middle management personnel and growing competition from other emerging Asian economies in manufacturing production. ", " Members reviewed data on global steel production as an indicator of the importance of China in the world economy. Crude steel production by China was rising by 15 per cent per annum, with growth in steel production elsewhere in the world flat. The share of China in world steel production was now approaching 40 per cent. Iron ore import volumes to China were also growing very strongly, with the share of China in total world iron ore imports around 45 per cent, having been only a bit above 10 per cent a decade ago. Australia was the largest supplier of iron ore to China. ", " Growth in other east Asian economies had picked up. In aggregate across the region, industrial production was now growing at around 8 per cent, about double the rate seen early in the year. ", " Data on industrial production and consumer and business sentiment in the euro area indicated that the pace of growth had eased but remained above average. ", " Conditions in commodity markets suggested that strong global demand was continuing despite the recent disruptions in credit markets in many countries. Base metals prices had risen since early August and had doubled over the past three years. Only part of the latest rise could be attributed to the depreciation of the US dollar. Oil prices had reached record high levels in the past few weeks, with the prices of both WTI and Tapis crude above US$80 per barrel. Spot prices of the bulk commodities of coal and iron ore, which are important Australian exports, had been strong, which suggested that the next round of contract price negotiations could see increases. Members noted that the outlook for commodity prices in general was firm. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members briefly discussed the key features of the national accounts for the June quarter, which had been released shortly after the commencement of the previous meeting. Growth in the quarter had been ¼ percentage point higher than expected, with no special factors to explain this. Apart from housing, all components of demand were strong. Farm output fell by 26 per cent over the year to the June quarter, but this was expected to turn around in the current financial year. GDP growth over the year was 4.3 per cent, and non-farm growth of 5.2 per cent over the year was the highest since 1998. Non-farm productivity growth was 2 per cent over the year to the June quarter, and although a little slower than in the second half of the 1990s, the data no longer raised the same puzzles that they had a year earlier. ", " It was possible that the recorded increase in output growth overstated the true extent of acceleration, following a period in 2005 and 2006 during which it had been implausibly low. But, in general, the current data consistently showed a picture of strong growth and suggested that this had continued into the September quarter. The NAB survey of business conditions, generally thought to be a reliable indicator of overall economic growth, had picked up over the past year, and early indications were that business conditions in the September quarter were as strong as at any point since the start of the survey in 1989. ", " According to the national accounts, business investment had increased by 10 per cent over the year to the June quarter. The share of investment in GDP had been rising over the past several years, particularly for the buildings and structures component, and was near the level seen in the late 1980s. ", " Business credit had increased by more than 25 per cent over the six months to August on an annualised basis. ", " Turning to household spending and incomes, members noted that good growth in employment and wages had led to strong growth in incomes, which in turn had spurred a lift in the pace of retail sales, to around 7 per cent per annum. The national accounts measure of real household disposable income had increased relatively strongly over the year to the June quarter. While interest payments were increasing as a share of incomes, the annual growth of real disposable income after interest payments was still very strong, at over 6 per cent. ", " House prices were now picking up steadily across all cities, after being flat in Sydney up to the middle of the year. In Sydney and Melbourne, the rise in prices was mostly in the more expensive suburbs, especially so in Melbourne, but even in Sydney the least expensive suburbs had seen prices stabilising after their earlier falls. Auction clearance rates were significantly higher over the year to September in both Sydney and Melbourne, which post-dated the recent interest rate increase and were consistent with a strong secondary housing market. ", " It was probably too early to expect to see any significant effects of the credit market disturbances on lending to households and businesses. August data for housing loan approvals and housing credit showed that the spike in June, which was associated with superannuation-related investment activity, had been unwound in the subsequent two months. This suggested that loan approvals and credit growth were back on the same trends as before June, i.e. consistent with underlying growth in housing credit of around 1 per cent per month. ", " Dwelling commencements up to the June quarter indicated that, on a national basis, the downturn had been mild. In fact, the downturn had occurred mainly in NSW, with commencements in other states being flat over the past four years. Members observed it was unlikely that people would commit to build homes until they were convinced prices had bottomed, and although demand for property by investors was growing, rents may not yet have increased sufficiently to provide an attractive return on newly constructed accommodation. ", " In the rural sector, the lack of follow-up rainfall over winter had led to downward revisions to the recovery in farm output in 2007/08. ABARE had released its September quarter outlook, which included a halving in the forecast recovery in wheat production. Members noted that further downward revisions were likely in the months ahead. As an indicator of tightening conditions in the grains market, wheat prices had risen very sharply in the past few weeks. ", " The labour market had continued to be strong in August, with employment continuing to increase at a year-ended rate of 2½–3 per cent. Further increases in job vacancies had confirmed the tightness of the labour market. Members recalled that the wage price index had risen by 4 per cent over the year to the June quarter, which indicated no acceleration in wages. The national accounts measure of average earnings per head had increased by 5½ per cent over the same period, though this series was volatile. ", " Revised GDP and inflation forecasts prepared for this meeting were similar to those presented at the previous meeting, but took account of the higher-than-expected growth in the June quarter national accounts. The forecasts incorporated some natural slowing in growth from the recent unusually fast pace, which would be intensified by the dampening effect of the tightening of monetary policy in August and recent problems in credit markets. World growth was expected to be ½ percentage point lower, following the credit market disturbances, and growth in Australia was expected to settle at around 3¼ per cent per annum over the forecast period, which was about trend. Inflation in underlying terms was expected to settle just under 3 per cent, with the headline rate gravitating towards that rate by the end of 2008. The staff view was that if credit markets calmed down relatively quickly, there could be upside risks to both the output and inflation forecasts. "], "Financial Markets": [" Financial strains had continued during September but lessened noticeably following the reduction in the federal funds rate of 50 basis points announced by the Federal Reserve on 18 September. The market currently expected two further reductions in the federal funds rate, each of 25 basis points, by the end of the year. ", " Global money market rates, which had been volatile since early August, fell sharply following the announcement of the Fed's decision. However, spreads on short-term money market instruments remained elevated in major financial markets, particularly in Europe and the United Kingdom, where financial institutions had experienced significant difficulties. ", " Commercial paper markets were opening up again for good-quality issuers and for longer maturities, and volumes were stabilising. It was nonetheless unlikely that the market would reach its previous levels of outstandings and may no longer provide a source of funding for some purposes. Bond issuance, particularly by financial institutions, had picked up considerably in late August and into September, with yields generally higher than they had been before the crisis began. ", " In Australia, spreads on short-term interest rates had begun to narrow from the peaks reached in September, and to a greater extent than seen in other developed countries. Bank bill spreads remained above the levels prevailing prior to the onset of the financial turmoil, in part the result of a shift from offshore to onshore financing, which was easier and cheaper to accomplish in current market circumstances. ", " The financial market disruption had seen a marked change in global policy rate expectations. In part, the disruption had delivered a tightening in credit conditions that some central banks had otherwise been intending to effect through increases in policy rates. The market now expected the European Central Bank to remain on hold rather than tighten policy further, and policy interest rates in Japan were not expected to be raised any time soon. As noted, further easing was expected in the United States. The Bank of England was now expected to ease rather than tighten further. ", " The People's Bank of China had tightened monetary policy settings further during the past month. There had been no change to exchange rate arrangements, with the slow rate of appreciation continuing. ", " Government bond yields in the major countries had increased from their recent lows, following safe-haven buying by investors during August, and had returned to the range that they had traded in for the past few years. ", " The yield curve in the United States had not changed at the longer end following the cut in the federal funds rate, unlike in the easing episode in 2001, where longer-term rates fell significantly and generated an easing in conditions for borrowers on fixed-rate mortgages. The current yield curve implied that the market was expecting stabilisation in the economy with the possibility of rising inflation down the track. These movements had not generated much easing for those on fixed-term mortgages. Those on adjustable-rate mortgages were better off, but many borrowers faced resets in the period ahead. ", " Share markets around the world rose strongly during September, particularly in Australia and emerging markets. However, stocks of financial institutions remained well below their peaks. Several US financial institutions had recently reported third-quarter earnings, and most had reported losses associated with activity in the US sub-prime and related markets. Despite the losses, some profit reports were still quite strong. ", " The Australian share market had outperformed other markets over the past month and was back at record high levels. Resource stocks had been very strong and local financial institutions had not been marked down as much as those in the United States. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had continued to decline and carry trades had been re-instated, which had favoured high-yielding currencies and prevented further appreciation of the yen against the US dollar. The euro was at an all-time high against the US dollar and the Canadian dollar had gone through parity; the US trade-weighted exchange rate had reached a record low. The strength of the pound sterling had been crimped by the effects of the Northern Rock crisis. ", " The Australian dollar had surged higher in September, after falling sharply during August, as the risk appetite of investors had returned. The current level of the exchange rate against the US dollar was just below the peak in February 1989. The most recent appreciation had pushed the exchange rate more than 12 per cent higher over the past year on a trade-weighted basis, and the Australian dollar had increased against all the currencies in the trade-weighted basket. ", " Turning to the domestic money market, members noted that Australian banks had been switching funding sources from offshore to onshore. After a very weak period during August and early September, bond issuance had started to pick up more recently. Bond issues by some domestic financials had been oversubscribed but spreads were higher than in the past few years; similar trends were in evidence for residential mortgage backed securities. ", " These higher funding costs were being passed through to interest rates on business loans, which tended to be priced off bank bill rates and had risen by about 25 basis points. However, the major banks were benefiting from an increased inflow of deposits, which contained the rise in average funding costs. This had allowed the majors to leave prime indicator housing rates unchanged and increase rates only on low-doc and non-conforming loans. Some of the non-bank lenders had announced increases in interest rates on loans of 10–15 basis points. ", " In relation to monetary policy, market expectations were for only a one-in-three chance of further tightening in Australia in coming months, but were higher for next year. Members noted that the September quarter CPI, which was scheduled for release later in the month, could change these expectations. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change to the cash rate in October. ", " In discussing the recommendation, Board members observed that the US economy appeared to be facing a more prolonged period of soft growth than had previously been expected and that the credit market disruptions could have a noticeable adverse effect on both the US and the euro-area economies in the period ahead. Conditions in the Australian economy had been very strong this year and the outlook was for further robust growth, with underlying inflation remaining at an uncomfortably high level. High global commodity prices, and the prospect of further increases in prices for some important export commodities, were continuing to stimulate domestic demand and increase incomes. This would be likely to add to inflationary pressures over the medium term, though the recent appreciation of the exchange rate would exert some dampening effect. ", " Members noted that the stresses arising from the turbulence in global financial markets appeared to have eased somewhat over the past month, but nonetheless markets remained fragile and uncertain. More significant losses among overseas financial institutions were likely to emerge, which could dent confidence. The extent to which global credit conditions had tightened as a result of recent developments was not yet clear, but emerging economies such as China were likely to be less affected than the larger developed economies. ", " Members noted that a <em lang=\"la\">prima facie</em> case to tighten policy further could be argued, based on the inflation risks from the strong momentum of the domestic economy and despite the slowing in the United States. However, the state of financial markets, while improving over the month, remained uncertain, which suggested caution in policy-setting. The potential effects of recent financial developments on the prospects for growth and inflation around the world and in Australia could become clearer over the coming month. Waiting would also allow time to assess the September quarter CPI and other data to be released before the next meeting.

{"Date": ["Sydney – 7 February 2017"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion by noting that the data on activity and inflation in the global economy had been more positive over recent months. There had been a broad-based pick-up in surveyed conditions in manufacturing across economies as well as in growth in industrial production and merchandise trade. GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners had increased a little over recent quarters and forecasts for 2017 and 2018 had been revised a little higher, partly because of expectations of expansionary fiscal policy in the United States. However, trading partner growth was still expected to ease slightly towards the end of the forecast period, reflecting a projected slowing in growth in China in the medium term. ", " Members observed that inflation in the advanced economies had continued to increase recently, mainly as a result of higher oil prices. Some measures of inflation expectations had also risen in late 2016. These developments and a decline in spare capacity were expected to flow through to higher core inflation in the advanced economies over time. Inflation rates were still below central banks' targets in most countries. ", " In China, economic growth had picked up in mid 2016, supported by accommodative financial conditions and fiscal stimulus, which had helped the authorities to achieve the annual GDP growth target. These outcomes had led to more confidence that Chinese growth would remain resilient in 2017. A range of policy measures had contributed to an increase in residential investment. There had been growth in residential property investment across a range of Chinese cities in the second half of 2016, which had led to a pick-up in demand for construction materials and growth in industrial sector output. Total social financing had increased at almost double the pace of GDP over 2016. This had supported the economy in the near term, but implied a further rise in China's debt-to-income ratio, which heightened the risks to Chinese growth in the medium term. Members noted that developments in China continued to be one of the main sources of uncertainty for the Australian economy. ", " Growth in the United States had increased in the second half of 2016. Further improvements in labour market conditions and rising consumer confidence had supported growth in household consumption, but business investment had remained subdued. Inflationary pressures had increased and inflation was close to the Federal Reserve's goal. The new US administration's proposed fiscal policy was expected to provide additional support to economic activity in the United States. However, members noted that the new US administration might introduce more restrictive policies on trade and immigration, which would pose significant downside risks to the forecast for global growth. ", " Growth in Japan had picked up over 2016 to be above estimates of potential growth, supported by public consumption and further improvements in labour market conditions. However, nominal wage growth and domestic inflationary pressures had remained subdued. ", " Growth in east Asia (excluding China and Japan) had been little changed over the previous year or so, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies throughout most of the region and a rise in external demand. Members noted that there had been a distinct pick-up in growth in industrial production in these economies in recent months. Growth in New Zealand and India had been relatively strong. ", " GDP growth in the euro area had been above estimates of potential growth and had been broadly based. While the euro area unemployment rate had declined to its lowest level since mid 2009, there was still spare capacity in many economies in the region. ", " Members observed that there had been a broad-based increase in global commodity prices since the previous meeting. The exception was the price of coking coal, which had fallen sharply from very high levels, as temporary disruptions to Australian supply had been resolved and the Chinese authorities had eased some of the restrictions on Chinese coal production. As a result of these commodity price developments, Australia's terms of trade had increased significantly and by more than had been expected. Although the rise in the terms of trade had been larger and lasted longer than expected, members noted that the stimulus for additional mining investment was likely to be limited and some of the higher income would accrue to foreign owners. The terms of trade were expected to decline over the forecast period, but to remain above their lows of early 2016. Nevertheless, the higher terms of trade represented a boost to national income, which provided some upside risks to the domestic forecasts. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members started their discussion of the domestic economy by noting the outcome for GDP growth in the September quarter. The 0.5 per cent decline in real GDP in the quarter was considerably weaker than had been expected, reflecting some temporary factors, including disruptions to coal supply and bad weather. Slower growth in consumption had also been a factor. This weakness was not expected to have continued into the December quarter and the forecasts for quarterly GDP growth were little changed. GDP growth was expected to pick up to around 3 per cent in year-ended terms later in 2017, and to remain above estimates of potential growth over the rest of the forecast period. ", " Although export volumes had been unexpectedly weak in the September quarter because of supply disruptions, growth in resource exports had subsequently increased. Members noted that Australia had recorded a significant trade surplus in the December quarter. Over the forecast period, Australia's low-cost producers of iron ore were expected to increase output further and the ramp-up in liquefied natural gas production was expected to make a significant contribution to output growth. The drag on growth from falling mining investment was also expected to diminish. ", " Non-mining business investment had increased by around 5 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Growth in non-mining business investment had been strongest in New South Wales and Victoria over recent years, where economic conditions had been most favourable. While non-residential building construction was likely to remain subdued in coming quarters, the increase in approvals over the past year across a range of sectors suggested that non-residential building construction would contribute to GDP growth towards the latter part of the forecast period. ", " Household consumption growth had been subdued in the June and September quarters of 2016, consistent with subdued growth in household income. More recently, growth in retail sales volumes for the December quarter had increased, households' perceptions of their personal finances had remained around average and expectations of unemployment had been low relative to recent years. Subdued growth in household income was likely to constrain consumption growth over the forecast period. ", " Members noted that the forecasts for consumption growth were closely related to labour market developments and households' expectations about their income growth. Employment had risen modestly in the December quarter and all of the increase had been in the full-time component, reversing the pattern of the previous few quarters. Forward-looking indicators had been consistent with some pick-up in employment growth over the period ahead. The unemployment rate had increased slightly in late 2016 to 5.8 per cent and was expected to edge only slightly lower over the forecast period. ", " Ongoing spare capacity in the labour market had contributed to subdued wage pressures, although there were some indications that wage growth had reached a trough. Growth in wages and household income were expected to increase gradually. Members observed that any increase in uncertainty that households have about their future income growth could lead to lower consumption growth, particularly for those households servicing sizeable debts. In contrast, if households were to become more positive about their future employment, income or wealth, then consumption growth could be stronger than suggested by the forecast. Similarly, stronger actual income growth would also tend to lead to stronger consumption growth than forecast. ", " Private dwelling investment had declined unexpectedly in the September quarter, largely because poor weather had disrupted construction. However, dwelling investment had grown at an above-average rate over the previous year, supported by low interest rates and further increases in housing prices. The large amount of work in the pipeline was expected to support dwelling investment at high levels over the next year or so, although there was some risk of more cancellations than usual if conditions in apartment markets deteriorated. ", " The combination of increased supply and lower population growth had already depressed rents and apartment prices in Perth and, increasingly, Brisbane. In contrast, conditions in the established housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had strengthened over the second half of 2016 and investor housing loan approvals had risen over recent months. Members noted that housing market activity in Melbourne and surrounding areas had been supported by strong population growth and improvements in transportation infrastructure. ", " Low wage growth and rent inflation had contributed to another low inflation outcome in December. Underlying and headline inflation had both been around 1½ per cent over 2016, in line with the forecasts presented in the November <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. Petrol prices had risen in the quarter, after subtracting from inflation over much of the previous few years. Higher tobacco prices had made a significant contribution to headline inflation over the year, and were expected to continue to do so given the further increases in tobacco excise that are scheduled over the next four years. ", " There were signs that non-tradables inflation had stabilised over recent quarters, after declining for a number of years. Prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items) had declined in the December quarter and over the year. The earlier depreciation of the exchange rate was no longer estimated to be putting upward pressure on tradables prices. Heightened competitive pressures in some product markets from the entrance of new competitors had also contributed to low inflation. While the impact of these pressures was expected to wane over time, the point at which this might occur was uncertain. ", " There had been very little change to the forecast for inflation. Underlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually, largely because unit labour costs were expected to rise gradually and spare capacity in the economy was expected to diminish. However, members noted that the factors that had weighed on inflationary pressures could be more persistent than had been assumed. On the other hand, wage growth could rise more quickly than forecast if labour market conditions were to improve by more than expected, particularly if employees were to demand wage increases to compensate for the period of low wage growth over recent years. Members also noted that the recent pick-up in global inflationary pressures could flow through to domestic inflation by more than expected. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion by observing that the US election result had driven developments in financial markets over the past two months. Market adjustments had been orderly and most measures of market volatility had remained low. ", " Financial market participants had generally viewed the new US administration's policies on corporate taxes, infrastructure spending and deregulation as positive for US growth, contributing to a further rise in Treasury yields and US share prices. Bond yields and share prices had already been moving higher since mid 2016 in response to the improved outlook for global growth and inflation. More recently bond yields had declined somewhat. ", " There had been similar movements in bond yields and share prices across the major economies, with the exception of government bond yields in Japan, which had remained around 0 per cent, consistent with the policy of yield curve control being implemented by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Also, in contrast to the other major economies, inflation in Japan had eased over the past year. ", " Members observed that most financial market measures of market volatility had remained low, despite measures of global policy uncertainty having risen to a high level. Meanwhile, the adjustments to financial market prices in emerging markets had been relatively contained, with the exception of large currency depreciations and increases in bond yields in Mexico, which is most exposed to any changes in US trade policy, and Turkey, reflecting domestic developments. Brazil and Russia had experienced exchange rate appreciations, largely reflecting higher commodity prices. ", " The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December, and members of the FOMC had revised up their projections for the pace of future rate increases, citing positive labour market and inflation developments. Financial market participants' expectations were that the federal funds rate would be increased by more than previously thought, but a slower pace of increase was expected than indicated by the FOMC. ", " The BoJ had left monetary policy unchanged since instituting its yield curve control framework in September 2016 and asset purchases had continued at around the same pace. The European Central Bank had made some adjustments to its policy stance, which remained very stimulatory. ", " Members observed that euro area government bond spreads to German government bonds had increased, particularly in Italy and France, due to political developments. ", " In nominal trade-weighted terms, the US dollar exchange rate had been appreciating since mid 2016 in line with positive economic data; it rose significantly following the US election. However, over the prior two months it had been little changed. The Japanese yen had also been little changed in nominal trade-weighted terms since the December Board meeting, while the euro had been broadly steady since early 2016. The Chinese renminbi had appreciated against the US dollar during 2017, after depreciating over 2016, but had been relatively stable since mid 2016 in trade-weighted terms. Net private sector capital outflows had increased over the second half of 2016, prompting the Chinese authorities to take measures to limit outflows. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated a little over the prior two months, supported by rising commodity prices. ", " Australian share prices had risen since the December Board meeting, in line with developments in international markets. In addition, higher commodity prices had supported increases in prices for resource stocks. Price-to-earnings ratios for Australian stocks had declined to be a little above their average since 2003. ", " Australian banks' bond issuance in 2016 had reached its highest level in a few years and had been at a longer-than-average tenor. Issuance had continued at a strong pace in 2017. The cost of new wholesale debt had risen, but was close to the cost of outstanding issuance for both short- and long-term debt. The composition of banks' funding had continued to shift towards domestic deposits and away from short-term debt ahead of the introduction in 2018 of the Net Stable Funding Ratio. Banks had used differences in deposit rates to encourage growth in longer-term deposits. ", " Over recent months there had been a small increase in variable housing lending rates for investors in housing, but little change in overall lending rates for owner-occupiers and in business lending rates. Over the prior year, the major banks had lowered lending rates by a little less than the decline in the cash rate. ", " Members noted that financial market pricing indicated that market participants expected the cash rate to remain unchanged at the February meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members viewed the near-term prospects for global growth as being more positive, although recognised the risks from policy uncertainty in the medium term. Stronger growth had contributed to higher inflationary pressures, including higher commodity prices, which had implications for the future stance of monetary policy in the advanced economies in coming years. Long-term bond yields had moved higher in many advanced economies. ", " Domestically, the economy was continuing its transition following the end of the mining investment boom. The fall in GDP in the September quarter had reflected some temporary factors. Looking forward, resource exports were expected to make a significant contribution to growth over the forecast period and the drag on growth from falling mining investment was expected to wane. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment. Consumption growth was expected to be stronger than the subdued outcomes in the middle of 2016, supported by low interest rates. However, the increase in consumption growth was expected to be limited given the forecast for subdued growth in household incomes. Non-mining business investment was also expected to gain some momentum. The outlook continued to be supported by the low level of interest rates. ", " Labour market outcomes had been mixed and, as a result, there was uncertainty about the momentum in the labour market. The unemployment rate had increased slightly at the end of 2016, but full-time employment growth had increased, having fallen throughout most of the year. The unemployment rate was forecast to edge lower, which implied that spare capacity would persist in the labour market for some time. ", " Conditions in housing markets varied considerably across the country. Housing prices and rents had been falling in Perth and there were signs that the significant increase in the supply of apartments had begun to affect prices and rents in Brisbane. In contrast, activity in the established housing market had picked up in Sydney and Melbourne in the second half of 2016, and investor credit growth had increased. Supervisory measures had strengthened lending standards and some lenders were taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. ", " Inflation outcomes for the December quarter were much as had been expected and there had been very little change to the forecast for inflation. Labour cost pressures were expected to build gradually from their current low levels as spare capacity in the labour market diminished and the effect of heightened competitive pressures on retail prices eased. Medium-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored and inflation was expected to increase gradually. ", " Taking account of all the information available, including the updated forecasts, an assessment of the risks affecting these forecasts and the level of the cash rate, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade had picked up further and survey measures of business conditions had remained at high levels. Headline inflation in the major advanced economies had increased noticeably in recent months, largely as a result of higher oil prices, to be close to most central banks' targets. However, core inflation had generally remained low. ", " The Chinese National People's Congress had announced a growth target for the Chinese economy in 2017 of around 6.5 per cent (or higher, if possible), which is only slightly lower than the pace of growth recorded for 2016. This suggested that the authorities would continue to use policy to support near-term growth. However, policymakers had also increased their focus on addressing the risks to longer-term growth. The People's Bank of China had signalled a reduction in monetary stimulus, reflecting concerns about rising financial stability risks, and the target for growth in total social financing had been lowered slightly to 12 per cent. Additional measures had also been put in place to curb rapid housing price growth in some cities. Members noted that there had been a pick-up in the growth of non-bank and off-balance sheet lending. ", " In the United States, consumption had been the key driver of expenditure growth over 2016, supported by continuing improvements in labour market conditions. Investment intentions had picked up significantly and the number of active oil rigs had increased in response to the higher level of oil prices. Fiscal policy was also expected to be expansionary under the new administration and the US economy was expected to grow above its potential rate in 2017. Members noted that the volume of trade destined for the United States had fallen significantly as a share of total global trade since the late 1990s. Nevertheless, a move to more protectionist policies would still be damaging for the medium-term outlook for both the US and global economies. Above-average growth in unit labour costs, higher oil prices and more expansionary fiscal policy were all expected to contribute to a further rise in core inflation, which had increased since 2015 to be only a little below the Federal Reserve's goal. ", " The euro area and Japanese economies had grown faster than their potential growth rates over 2016, resulting in further improvements in labour market conditions. The unemployment rate in the euro area had fallen to its lowest level in seven years, while the unemployment rate in Japan had declined to a two-decade low. In both economies, core inflation had remained low, while headline inflation had increased, largely as a result of higher oil prices. In the euro area, headline inflation had increased to be consistent with the European Central Bank's target. Measures of inflation expectations in both economies had been steady or had increased. ", " Members observed that merchandise exports had picked up for the euro area and Japan towards the end of 2016. A significant increase in merchandise exports had also contributed to growth in East Asia. Members noted that the increase in global trade over the second half of 2016 had been underpinned by an improvement in global economic conditions, both for Australia's major trading partners and other parts of the world that were important sources of external demand for output from East Asia. ", " Australia's terms of trade had risen by around 15 per cent over the second half of 2016 and were expected to rise again in the March quarter. In February, prices for iron ore, base metals and crude oil had all reached their highest level in more than a year, although the price of coking coal had fallen from its peak in November. Some reversal in the terms of trade was still expected, although the recent improvement in global demand suggested that higher commodity prices could be more persistent than previously anticipated. Members noted that generalised strength in commodity prices tended to indicate an improvement in global demand conditions, but that factors affecting the supply of commodities had also affected prices. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" GDP growth in the December quarter of 1.1 per cent had been above expectations. The outcome partly reflected the reversal of some of the temporary factors that had contributed to the fall in output in the September quarter. Most notably, there had been a solid pick-up in export growth in the December quarter; in addition, growth in both consumption and business investment had been higher than expected. Total nominal income had risen strongly, driven by growth in mining sector profits as a result of the higher terms of trade; in contrast, growth in labour incomes had been unusually weak. ", " The mining sector had contributed to growth in the December quarter, reflecting higher exports and an unexpected increase in investment. Members observed that some resource firms may have been able to increase their exports to take advantage of higher commodity prices by running down inventories. Consistent with previous staff forecasts, the capital expenditure survey of investment intentions continued to indicate that mining investment would fall further over the following year or so, but that the drag on growth would dissipate over this period. ", " Non-mining business investment had risen in the December quarter, largely as a result of higher non-residential construction, although machinery and equipment investment had also risen. Non-mining business investment had picked up over the previous two years or so and business conditions had been more positive in recent months. In contrast to these more positive signs, non-residential building approvals had declined further and the capital expenditure survey continued to suggest that, in aggregate, firms do not intend to increase their spending on non-mining investment over the following year or so. Members observed, however, that this survey does not cover some important sectors, including education and health, and also does not include investment in intellectual property, which has become an increasingly important share of non-mining business investment in the national accounts measure. Members noted that in most sectors there had been little evidence that non-mining business investment had been held back by lack of access to credit. ", " Dwelling investment had rebounded in the December quarter; much of the strength had been concentrated in New South Wales. Even though building approvals had fallen significantly in recent months, the substantial amount of building work in the pipeline suggested that dwelling investment would continue to contribute to growth in coming quarters. Conditions in established housing markets had continued to differ significantly across the country. Over recent months, conditions appeared to have strengthened in Sydney and had remained strong in Melbourne; these cities had continued to record brisk growth in housing prices, and auction clearance rates had remained high. Housing loan approvals and credit growth had picked up for investors, primarily in New South Wales and Victoria. In contrast, housing prices and rents had fallen in Perth for two years or so, and apartment prices had declined in Brisbane. ", " Rural exports had grown strongly in the December quarter, reflecting strong farm production following favourable weather conditions in many areas over the second half of 2016. As a result of this and the higher prices for bulk commodity exports, there had been a trade surplus in the December quarter for the first time in almost three years. The current account deficit had narrowed to less than 1 per cent of GDP, the smallest deficit since 1980; the trade surplus was partly offset by a widening in the net income deficit as some of the increase in mining profits had accrued to foreign owners. ", " Household consumption growth, which had been relatively subdued in mid 2016, picked up in the December quarter, consistent with retail sales. Liaison with retailers suggested that recent trading conditions had been around average and household perceptions of their personal finances had also been around average. ", " The pick-up in consumption growth stood in contrast to the ongoing weakness in labour incomes, with the household saving ratio declining in the December quarter. Members noted that over the past two decades movements in the Australian household saving ratio had been much larger than those in other similar economies. One contributing factor was likely to have been that Australia had experienced a much larger terms of trade cycle than other developed economies with significant commodity exports. Differences in the evolution of household saving ratios across the states suggested that the terms of trade had played an important role in households' saving and spending decisions. ", " Indicators of labour market conditions had remained mixed. Employment growth had picked up in recent months and the unemployment rate had edged down to 5.7 per cent in January. Leading indicators, including job advertisements and firms' employment intentions, suggested that there could be some pick-up in employment growth in the near term. Members noted that although experience had varied across the states, in recent years employment growth had generally been stronger in the capital cities than in regional areas. Employment growth had continued to be concentrated in part-time jobs over the past year and wage growth had remained low, suggesting that the labour market had not been quite as strong as the headline employment and unemployment rate figures had indicated. ", " The wage price index had increased by 1.9 per cent over 2016, in line with the staff forecasts. Subdued wage growth appeared to have been broad based and was most pronounced in mining-related industries and states. Average earnings per hour in the national accounts had fallen sharply in the December quarter, as had the wage bill as a share of nominal GDP. Although quarterly movements in average earnings per hour are volatile, this measure of wage growth had also been subdued in year-ended terms, continuing to suggest there was very little labour cost pressure in the economy. Members noted that the recent experience of low inflation may also have contributed to lower wage outcomes and that other business costs, such as rents, are often linked to inflation. Members observed that although credit growth was lower than in previous decades, it had been faster than the subdued growth in household incomes. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion by noting that global financial markets had been relatively quiet over the preceding month, with market participants focused on evolving expectations about the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting, the new US administration's policies and national elections in Europe in coming months. Globally, monetary policy remained very stimulatory and financing remained readily available on favourable terms. ", " Financial market participants' expectations for an increase in the federal funds rate at the March meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had risen to over 90 per cent. This followed continued positive economic news in the United States as well as statements by FOMC members. Members noted the widely held expectations for no change in monetary policy settings in the euro area and Japan, compared with the general view earlier in the previous year that further monetary easing was in prospect in these economies. ", " In major markets, 10-year government bond yields remained above their lows of mid 2016, reflecting the run of more positive economic news since then, as well as expectations that the new US administration's policies would support US growth. Members observed that, although euro area government bond spreads to German government bonds had increased over recent months in response to political developments, yields remained relatively low by historical standards. Corporate bond yields in developed markets remained very low, with spreads to government bonds having narrowed markedly over the previous year, particularly for non-investment grade bonds. Australian government bond yields had been little changed over the month and the spread to US Treasury yields had also been steady at a low level. As in other markets, Australian corporate bond spreads had narrowed over the preceding year. ", " Global equity prices had moved higher over the prior month in response to continued positive economic data. In the United States, financial sector share prices had increased strongly following the new administration's orders for a review of financial market regulations. In the euro area, banks' share prices had declined following lower-than-expected earnings, which were largely related to loan-loss provisions. Over the previous year or so, Australian share prices had moved broadly in line with those in the rest of the world excluding the United States, where share prices had risen further. Recent Australian company earnings results had been generally positive, driven by strong profits in the resources sector. ", " The US dollar had been little changed over the prior month in nominal trade-weighted terms, while the euro had depreciated a little against the US dollar, in part reflecting political uncertainty around the upcoming national elections. The Chinese renminbi had been broadly unchanged over the preceding month against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms. ", " Members noted that the People's Bank of China had tightened monetary policy a little and indicated that further tightening was likely in response to rising inflationary pressures and to address leverage, including of financial institutions. The tightening had flowed through to increased corporate bond spreads; recent bond issuance in China had been weak after a sustained period of strength, although yields had remained low. In emerging markets more broadly, financial market conditions had been favourable and flows into emerging market funds had resumed as the global economic outlook had improved since mid 2016. ", " The Australian dollar had been little changed over the prior month and had remained more than 10 per cent higher against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms since early 2016, reflecting the significant increase in commodity prices since then. ", " Members observed that Australian banks' funding costs and average outstanding housing and business lending rates were estimated to have been broadly steady over recent months. Interest rates had increased slightly over prior months for some investor and interest-only housing loans. ", " Financial market pricing indicated that market participants expected the cash rate to remain unchanged at the March meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that recent data had continued to support a more positive outlook for growth of Australia's major trading partners than had been apparent a few quarters earlier. A number of indicators, including growth in global industrial production, global trade volumes and business sentiment, had improved. Recent data had also confirmed the pick-up in global inflation. Financial market data suggested that the probability of the Federal Reserve increasing the federal funds rate at the March meeting had increased markedly and there was no longer an expectation of further monetary easing in other major economies. At the same time, however, there continued to be significant uncertainty about policy in China and the United States and the implications for global growth and trade after 2017. ", " Domestically, there had been a significant increase in the terms of trade in the second half of 2016 and many commodity prices had risen further in recent months. Although mining companies were expected to increase their dividend payouts following the sharp rise in mining sector profits in the December quarter, a significant proportion of shareholders are non-residents, which would limit the flow-through to an increase in household incomes in Australia. However, the fact that the recent increases in commodity prices had been supported by a pick-up in global demand raised the possibility that commodity prices could be higher than expected, in which case the flow-through to the domestic economy could be larger than currently forecast. ", " The Australian economy had continued to make its transition following the end of the mining investment boom, supported by the low level of interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013. GDP growth had picked up in the December quarter to be around 2½ per cent over 2016, which was only a little below estimates of the medium-term potential growth rate of the economy. This outcome confirmed that the weakness in the September quarter was temporary. Looking forward, year-ended growth was expected to pick up gradually to be above its potential rate over the forecast period. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate the adjustment of the economy following the end of the mining investment boom. ", " Momentum in the labour market remained difficult to assess, but it was clear that spare capacity remained and there continued to be significant differences in labour market outcomes across the country. Domestic wage pressures remained subdued and household income growth had been low, which, if it were to persist, would have implications for consumption growth and the risks posed by the level of household debt. Spare capacity was expected to decline slowly as momentum in the economy built; wage growth and underlying inflation were expected to rise, but only gradually. ", " Recent data continued to suggest that there had been a build-up of risks associated with the housing market. In some markets, conditions had been strong and prices were rising briskly, although in other markets prices were declining. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments was scheduled to come on stream over the next few years. Growth in rents had been the slowest for two decades. Borrowing for housing by investors had picked up over recent months and growth in household debt had been faster than that in household income. Supervisory measures had contributed to some strengthening of lending standards. ", " Given all of these considerations, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},

", " ML Edey, KM Hall, PW Lowe ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 7 August 2007 were approved. "], "Financial Markets": [" In view of the importance of developments in financial markets over the past month, including their implications for the outlook for the real economy, the meeting commenced with a discussion of those developments. ", " Financial strains had intensified in August as the contagion from the problems in the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States spread more widely. Particular financial institutions in Europe were affected as global investors became very risk averse, resulting in an unwillingness to roll over asset-backed commercial paper. This sapped confidence in broader financial markets. The problems were manifested mainly in liquidity shortages, which put pressure on central banks to increase the provision of liquidity. ", " Following an announcement by BNP Paribas in Europe that it was suspending redemptions in several funds, European overnight money market rates rose sharply above policy target rates, despite the ECB's intervention. From there, the problems spread to most countries in early August. For instance, the effective fed funds rate in the United States rose to 6 per cent compared with the target rate of 5.25 per cent. In response, the Fed injected large amounts of funds through its money market operations, which led the fed funds rate to fall well below the target rate for a time. However, yields on 90-day bankers' acceptances, which had been around the same rate as fed funds for most of the year, also rose sharply in early August and did not fall when the actual fed funds rate fell; rates on bankers' acceptances remained about 25 basis points higher during the month than their previous level, which represented an increase in the cost of funds for banks. ", " Yields on asset-backed paper increased the most, by around 60 basis points, and some parts of the market essentially shut down. Moreover, the most highly regarded institutions could roll over paper for only very short maturities and the flow-on effects were felt in the United States and elsewhere, including Australia. ", " The turbulence in credit markets had the effect of locking out financial institutions from raising term funds; this was particularly the case for mortgage lenders, with investors reluctant to invest beyond one week. ‘Second tier’ names had trouble raising even short-term funds. The difficulty the Fed had in getting cash to flow to the institutions most in need, despite the actual fed funds rate being well below target, led it on 17 August to cut the discount rate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points above the fed funds target rate. This action was designed to lessen the cost of emergency funding to around 7,000 banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System and have access to the discount window. The Fed also lengthened the term of borrowing from the discount window from typically overnight to 30 days and it signalled that it would consider accepting as collateral from banks the asset-backed paper issued by their affiliated structured-finance vehicles (also known as conduits). The same operational challenges for central banks were experienced elsewhere. ", " The risk aversion of investors around the world spread to equity markets, where sharp falls were recorded, particularly for financial stocks. US equities fell by nearly 10 per cent from their highs in July before retracing about half that in the latter part of August. ", " Global risk aversion was also seen in wider spreads for corporate bonds as investors turned to the security of government paper. Yields in bond markets around the world fell. For instance, yields on 10-year US Treasuries fell by about 65 basis points from their peaks in July, to around 4½ per cent; larger falls in yields were seen in the short-term Treasury bill market, typically a safe haven for investors. ", " Outstandings in the asset-backed commercial paper market fell by nearly 15 per cent in August, with the assets and funding presumably taken back onto banks' balance sheets. Members noted that the shift to extreme risk aversion implied that credit markets were no longer functioning effectively. ", " Policy rates of most major central banks had not changed over the past month. The injections of liquidity were technical operations and not meant to signify any change to monetary policy settings. However, expectations of a cut in the fed funds rate had risen, based in part on the statement accompanying the discount rate cut in mid August, which pointed to a change in the balance of risks in the real economy. Policy rates in Europe and Japan, which were previously seen as likely to rise, were now expected to be left on hold, and this was the case for most countries. The main exception was China, where there had been further measures to tighten monetary policy during August. ", " Australia was caught up in the dramatic retrenchment of risk in financial markets. The Bank met the sharp increase in demand for cash by providing additional liquidity to the market over the second half of August. Exchange settlement balances, which financial institutions hold with the Bank, exceeded $5 billion in late August, the highest level since the late 1990s and well above the usual average level of around $700 million. More recently, the Bank had drained some of the excess cash from the system as conditions had stabilised a little. The Bank's repurchase agreement (repo) operations had been largely in bank bills and certificates of deposit, rather than Commonwealth Government securities, in an effort to alleviate pressures in the interbank funding market, and the term of repos had tended to lengthen in the past month. These operations kept the actual cash rate in Australia firmly anchored to the target. Nevertheless, rates on three-month funds, in particular those representing the cost of borrowing offshore, rose sharply from early August. Consequently, banks turned back to the domestic market for their funding, even though funding costs there were also elevated. ", " Members were informed that the Bank was contemplating further widening the pool of collateral it would accept in repo operations given the funding problems currently being experienced by some mid-tier Australian banks, whose funding was heavily concentrated offshore. It was also the case that the class of paper currently accepted by the Bank as collateral was quite narrow by international standards. Members accepted that any change to these arrangements would be designed to improve liquidity and that the banks affected by the liquidity crisis had no problems with asset quality. They recognised the difficulty of communicating this change in arrangements to the market and asked to be informed when the Bank proceeded with the change. ", " In a wider discussion, members commented that the current crisis would lead some banks to change their business models and that if the higher funding costs were sustained, loan rates were likely to rise. At the very least, discounts on some housing loan products were likely to be reviewed. Such developments, if they occurred, would represent a de facto tightening of monetary policy. It was noteworthy that the recent turbulence in credit markets posed challenges for lenders, as profit margins had been squeezed, particularly for those reliant on securitisation, where the US asset-backed commercial paper market was currently no longer a viable source of funding. This implied a probable competitive realignment among lenders. ", " In relation to monetary policy, expectations of further tightening in Australia had been pared back in the past few weeks and the market now perceived little chance of a rate rise this year. ", " The Australian dollar had been particularly volatile in August. Volatility in the Australian dollar/yen exchange rate was the highest since the float, as fluctuations in market conditions led investors to reverse and then re-engage in carry trades during the month. Disorderly conditions in the foreign exchange market led the Bank to intervene for the first time since May 2001. The Australian dollar had fallen sharply in local trading on 16 August and when it continued to fall in thin market conditions in London, the Bank moved to steady the market, at first anonymously through an agent but later in New York in its own name. Following these interventions, the exchange rate stabilised at around US78¼ cents and then appreciated by nearly US1½ cents. ", " Although the Australian dollar strengthened in late August, it remained significantly below the peaks in July, particularly against the yen, and was about 7 per cent lower on a trade-weighted basis. However, taking a longer-term perspective, the exchange rate was still well above its post-float average in trade-weighted terms. "], "Financial Stability": [" Against the background of recent events, the Board's discussion focused on three main issues: the longer-term structural issues raised by the global repricing of risk; the longer-term health of the Australian banking system; and developments in household balance sheets. ", " Members reviewed a number of issues arising from the repricing of risk, which came after a long period during which risk was widely considered to be underpriced. These issues included: the importance of liquidity for the smooth functioning of financial markets; the extent to which credit risk transfer markets had allowed banks to shed risk; and the problems posed by the growth in trading in complex instruments that were difficult for investors to understand and where price transparency was poor. Members also discussed the role of rating agencies going forward. ", " Members noted that the global repricing of risk was also clearly evident in Australian markets and, as with international markets, was most obvious in the spreads on banks' short-term paper and the premia on credit default swaps for banks. Both APRA and the Bank were holding discussions with the Australian banks about their liquidity, and the flow of information between the two institutions was working well. ", " These developments were occurring against the background that the Australian banking system was highly profitable, well capitalised and viewed favourably by the international rating agencies. Loan quality remained high and, while the ratio of non-performing loans to total on-balance sheet assets had risen slightly over the most recent six months, it was low by both historical and international standards. ", " Reviewing household-sector balance sheets, members noted that generally these remained in good shape, reflecting the favourable macroeconomic environment. Household net worth had increased by around 10 per cent over the past year and household gearing ratios were still on the lower side in international comparisons. While the proportion of housing loans that was in arrears had increased over recent years, there were some signs that it was levelling out. Members also noted that an important factor contributing to the rise in the aggregate interest servicing burden was an increase in the share of households with debt. Despite the aggregate indicators being generally benign, members observed that there were pockets of difficulty, most noticeably in New South Wales. Arrears appeared to be concentrated in western Sydney. Court data also showed that the number of writs of possession was highest in this part of Sydney, while Census data showed that the share of households with an owner-occupier debt-servicing ratio above 30 per cent was considerably higher than in other parts of the country. ", " The Board's overall assessment was that the strength of the core Australian banking system was an important factor in alleviating some of the concerns arising from the deterioration in credit markets. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The national accounts for the June quarter were released shortly after the meeting commenced. The data had come in stronger than expected by most commentators, with the national accounts painting a picture of very strong growth in the Australian economy up to the middle of the year. Growth in output had been 0.9 per cent in the June quarter and 4.3 per cent over the year; non-farm GDP growth over the year to the June quarter was over 5 per cent. Domestic spending had increased by close to 2 per cent in the June quarter and 5.6 per cent over the year, with public demand being a particularly strong component in both periods. As a result of the strong growth in output, measures of productivity had increased by almost 3 per cent over the year to the June quarter, well above average productivity growth in recent years. ", " While price indexes in the national accounts suggested that the increase in prices of consumer goods over the year to the June quarter was broadly similar to that indicated by the CPI, measures of wages in the national accounts were rising considerably more rapidly than shown by the wage price index (WPI). However, the national accounts series on compensation of employees was volatile and also conceptually different from the WPI. ", " Turning to the regular data series released over the past month, members noted that indicators of consumption for July were strong. Although volatile in the June quarter, retail sales had risen rapidly in both June and July, with the year-ended rate remaining at about 7 per cent. The data for large and small retailers showed that, in the past two months, sales by large retailers, which are fully enumerated by the ABS and hence more reliable, had picked up. Motor vehicle sales had also been strong in the past few months, to be running at about 10 per cent above average levels in 2006. ", " In the secondary housing market, house prices at the top end of the Sydney and Melbourne markets had strengthened, with the increases particularly sharp in Melbourne in recent months. However, prices at the lower end in Sydney, which had peaked in early 2004, were still flat or falling. In Perth, where rises in house prices in recent years had been extremely rapid, there was now a levelling out in prices. Overall, nationwide house prices were about 8 per cent higher over the past year. ", " Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had risen strongly through the first half of 2007. There had been little change in the data covering the first few weeks of August, which suggested that the market for upper-end property sales had remained strong following the increase in the cash rate and housing interest rates early in the month. ", " In further signs of tight conditions in the housing market, rents had risen rapidly over the past year, with the REIA series for rents on newly tenanted dwellings rising sharply and vacancy rates close to record low levels in all capitals. ", " Overall business conditions, as measured by the NAB survey, had increased to around record high levels in the June quarter. This indicator appeared broadly consistent with the national accounts data over the recent period and confirmed that conditions had strengthened since the start of the year. ", " The labour market had continued to be strong in July, with a further rise in employment and steady unemployment at 4.3 per cent, which was a very low level. Despite this, there had been no acceleration in wage growth in the June quarter. The WPI had risen by 4 per cent over the year to the June quarter, which was the same rate prevailing for the past few years. Members acknowledged that this outcome was difficult to reconcile with the data on wages in the national accounts. "], "Revisions to the Outlook for the Australian Economy": [" Revised GDP and inflation forecasts were prepared for this meeting, which attempted to take account of the turmoil in financial markets during August. The revised central forecast, prepared before the release of the higher-than-expected June quarter national accounts data, had taken about ½ percentage point off the forecast for non-farm growth prepared for the July meeting. This adjustment represented the estimated effect on growth of the policy tightening in August and disruption in credit markets in the past few weeks. The latter effect was seen to occur most directly via the housing market, through lower lending for construction and associated feedback effects. This forecast assumed that conditions in credit markets would start to improve in the near future, though credit spreads would remain higher than they had been in the first half of this year. ", " An alternative scenario was also prepared to assess the effect on the forecasts of a protracted credit crisis around the world and in Australia. The purpose was to provide illustrative rather than precise magnitudes of the possible effects if the recent problems in financial markets were sustained. With the credit disruption a worldwide event, world growth was assumed to be 2 percentage points lower over the forecast period. The assumed tightening in the global credit market would lead to a reduction in capital inflows to Australia and a lowering of the current account deficit, which would require a substantial depreciation of the exchange rate. As a consequence, relative to the central forecast, non-farm GDP growth in Australia was estimated to be 1½ percentage points lower: a larger fall in domestic spending would be cushioned by the effect of the lower exchange rate on the competitiveness of exporters and import-competing industries. ", " The weaker economy would result in a rise in unemployment and a fall in wage growth. Taking account of the reduced pass-through of exchange rate depreciations to inflation in recent years, the assumed exchange rate depreciation would nonetheless boost inflation above the central forecast in the short term, but the slowing in demand and lower level of resource utilisation would see underlying inflation declining by the end of the forecast period. ", " Updated forecasts for output and inflation, which would incorporate the latest national accounts data and other recent developments, would be prepared for the next meeting. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The discussion of the world economy provided Board members with an update of conditions prior to the emergence of the recent problems in credit markets. The story was one of strength in most regions, based on the June quarter national accounts where they were available. Growth in Australia's trading partners was above 5 per cent for the year to the June quarter, which was near the highest rates seen over the past 15 years, and it appeared to be firming in the period for which data were available. Members noted that growth in output in India had been very strong over the past year and that it had now stepped up to be more than 9 per cent per annum. ", " In the United States, the June quarter national accounts, which reported growth of 0.8 per cent in the quarter, suggested that growth outside the housing sector was holding up reasonably well. The question remained about the extent to which the current weakness in housing activity, including in the secondary market, would spread to other parts of the economy. Indicators for housing construction up to July had remained very weak and were likely to deteriorate further as the credit disruption took its effect. The stock of unsold houses was being worked off, but this process had a long way to run and it was too soon to tell whether or not the cycle in new home sales had reached a trough. ", " House prices in the United States had begun to level out or were falling, according to three key measures. Members were informed that the most accurate indicator of current trends in house prices was the Case-Shiller series, which was a monthly repeat-sales index derived from sales of houses in the 20 largest cities. This series suggested that house prices across the United States peaked in mid 2006 and had fallen noticeably over the past year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for no change to the cash rate in September. ", " In discussing the recommendation, Board members observed that macroeconomic conditions in the world economy and Australia were at least as strong as in the previous month, when policy was tightened. Recent data for the Australian economy continued to suggest a robust pace of expansion, with output rising faster than trend and capacity utilisation and confidence high. However, downside risks to the United States economy had increased as a result of the ongoing weakness of the housing sector there. ", " Members noted that there were stresses arising from the turbulence in global financial markets as participants had struggled during recent weeks to re-price risk in the face of heightened uncertainty. Although these stresses were not always visible to those not directly involved in credit markets, the economic effects were potentially significant. Short-term wholesale funding costs for financial institutions had risen, including for Australian entities, and some segments of the capital markets were effectively closed. The higher cost of funding faced by these institutions, if sustained, would at some point be passed on to indicator lending rates. In the absence of offsetting developments, this factor, together with the heightened risk of slower world growth, would exert some additional restraint on demand, and hence inflation, in Australia. ", " While the strength of the underlying economy was seen by members as possibly requiring a further monetary policy tightening to prevent inflation from rising above the target range, the financial developments over the past month could result in a tightening of financial conditions independently of movements in the cash rate. Under those circumstances, members judged that a stable policy setting was appropriate for the time being. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.5 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 7 August 2007"], "Text": {"Present": [" GR Stevens (Chairman), R Battellino, KR Henry AC, JR Broadbent AO, RC Corbett AM, GJ Kraehe AO, DG McGauchie AO, WJ McKibbin ", " GL Debelle, ML Edey ", " DH Emanuel (Secretary), AL Dickman (Deputy Secretary) "], "Minutes": [" The minutes of the meeting held on 3 July 2007 were approved. "], "Recent Inflation Data and Outlook for the Australian Economy": [" Board members commenced their discussion of domestic economic conditions by reviewing the June quarter CPI, which had increased by 1.2 per cent in the quarter and 2.1 per cent over the year. The headline figures had been volatile in recent quarters, with sharp movements in petrol and food prices making it difficult to discern the trend. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation, which attempt to remove these temporary influences, indicated inflation of 0.9 per cent in the quarter and 2¾ per cent over the year, which was higher than expected prior to the release of the CPI. ", " In a general indication of increased inflation pressure in the June quarter, price rises were more common than price falls, with 60 per cent of the items in the CPI by weight rising by more than 2.5 per cent in the quarter. Prices of tradable items in the CPI had increased by 1 per cent over the year to the June quarter, having risen from the low point in 2003/04. The recent exchange rate appreciation was expected to reduce tradables inflation to about zero, with this effect apparent over the next one to two years. On the other hand, inflation among non-tradable items in the CPI, which was more reflective of demand and capacity pressures, had been running around a 3½ per cent pace over the past few years and was expected to rise. One important component of non-tradable prices was rent. Increases in rents, which accounted for about 6 per cent of the CPI, had picked up to 5 per cent over the year to the June quarter. Upward pressure on the CPI measure of rents inflation could continue as the REIA measure of newly tenanted properties was rising by over 8 per cent. ", " As a sign of inflation pressure arising from the high rate of capacity utilisation in the economy, members noted that the main factor constraining output, according to the NAB business survey, had shifted over the past two or three years to the availability of suitable labour. Prior to that, the main constraint had been a lack of sales and orders. ", " Members reviewed the outlook for output growth, which was unchanged from that presented at the previous meeting. Non-farm GDP growth was expected to be around 3¾ per cent annualised over the next two years, although recent quarterly figures had been volatile. Farm output was expected to add about ½ percentage point to GDP growth over the year ahead, with a boost to production following improved rainfall so far this year. The CPI forecast had been revised upward following the June quarter data. The current underlying inflation rate of 2¾ per cent was expected to drift up to around 3 per cent by the end of 2007 and remain at that rate or be a touch higher over the next two years in the absence of any monetary policy tightening. The headline rate of inflation would be kept down in the next one or two quarters because of the effect of lower banana prices, but thereafter was expected to track at around the same rate as underlying inflation. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" In looking at the run of regular data releases over the past month, members noted the very strong credit growth in June for both households and businesses. Liaison indicated that the figures for households may have been lifted by borrowings associated with contributions to superannuation funds in June. Even abstracting from this, it was clear that housing loan approvals and housing credit growth had drifted upward since the start of the year. Business credit growth had increased sharply over the past few months and, at 22 per cent on a six-month-ended annualised basis, was now the fastest since the late 1980s. Members considered the pick-up in credit growth in the broader context of current financial conditions. Although the cash rate was noticeably above the average for the past decade, the current level of interest rates facing borrowers was characterised as mildly restrictive for new housing lending, being somewhat above the average level over the past decade, but about average for business lending on the same basis. Members observed that competition in business lending in recent years had led to a situation now in which there was very little spread between interest rates on business and housing loans. ", " Recently released census data had shown that home ownership had been relatively flat over the past two decades at a little over 70 per cent of households. Owner-occupiers with housing debt represented about 35 per cent of households. This proportion had fallen from the early 1980s to late 1990s, but in recent years had risen again as households were holding on to debt for longer periods and taking advantage of loan redraw facilities. ", " House prices had risen in all capital cities except Perth in the latest month, according to APM estimates based on transactions entered into in the first half of the year. Prices in Sydney had only recently begun to rise after a three-year period during which they had declined. There were indications that prices in the top end of the Sydney and Melbourne markets in particular were firming, but those in the lowest-priced suburbs had been weaker. Also, auction clearance rates, which tend to reflect activity in higher-priced suburbs, had picked up strongly in Sydney and Melbourne since late last year. ", " Retail sales had increased strongly in June after sales had fallen slightly in April and May. Looking through the short-term volatility occasioned by varying seasonal patterns in demand, year-ended growth in sales had been around <span class=\"no-wrap\">6–7 per cent</span> for the past several months. Members noted that much of the short-term volatility in retail sales was accounted for by small retailers, whose sales were less accurately estimated by the ABS. Sales by larger retailers, which were fully enumerated by the ABS, had been more stable and accounted for a growing share of total retail sales over recent years. Consumer sentiment remained high in July, close to the record level reached a few months earlier. ", " In the residential construction sector, data on building approvals, while volatile from month to month, suggested that the cyclical low point may have been reached after a long period of gradual decline in the number of approvals. ", " Overall business conditions had increased in the June quarter, according to the NAB survey, and were around previously recorded peaks ", " Labour market data had continued to be strong. There had been a modest rise in employment in June, following larger increases in the previous two months, and the year-ended rate of increase was 3 per cent. In an indication of the tightness of the labour market, the unemployment rate had been trending down over the past five years despite the upward trend in the participation rate. ", " Overall, members observed that the GDP data for the March quarter, which were discussed at the previous meeting, coupled with the latest readings from the labour force and business surveys were all consistent with a picture of considerable domestic economic strength. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The outlook for the world economy had improved over recent months, although official forecasts were yet to reflect any assessment of the fallout from recent financial volatility. The latest quarterly forecasts from the IMF indicated upward revisions for world growth, from 4.9 per cent to 5.2 per cent for both 2007 and 2008. Downward revisions to expected growth in the United States, flowing from the housing downturn, had been more than offset by upward revisions for other parts of the world, notably China and India. ", " In the United States, the focus was on the likely effect of the housing downturn on overall growth in the year ahead. Thus far, non-housing components of demand had remained resilient. GDP growth in the June quarter had been 0.8 per cent and 1.8 per cent over the year, but excluding residential investment, year-ended growth in expenditure-based GDP had been 1 percentage point higher. Permits to build and housing starts were down by one-third and it was not clear if the trough of the cyclical downturn had been reached. The stock of unsold new homes was beginning to be worked off, but this was a slow process and the volume of sales was low. ", " In other countries, economic conditions were positive. Year-ended GDP growth in China was just under 12 per cent for the June quarter. Growth in Korea had picked up recently, in part reflecting the effect of higher demand from China and stronger US business investment. Conditions in the euro area suggested that growth and sentiment among businesses and consumers had moderated after the pick-up over the past year, but the economy overall remained relatively firm. "], "Financial Markets": [" The focus of developments in financial markets in recent weeks had been the fallout in credit markets from the sub-prime mortgage lending problems in the United States. While problems in the sub-prime market had been evident for some time, the latest bout of market volatility had arisen because the scale of leverage and extent of exposure among financial institutions associated with sub-prime lending had become more apparent. Thus far, it appeared that the exposure to sub-prime lending was spread fairly widely. The problems besetting Bear Stearns, which had been covered at the previous meeting, had worsened further in recent weeks. Australia had been home to a high-profile case of financial losses following exposure to the sub-prime market: a hedge fund, Basis Capital, had two funds, which had experienced large losses totalling around $650 million, causing the funds to collapse. ", " Members were informed about the structure of the hedge fund sector in Australia. It was thought that most of the exposure to sub-prime loans had already surfaced, as there were only a small number of funds whose predominant investment strategy was fixed income. Most funds were of the ‘long-short equity’ variety. However, it was possible that some ‘fund of funds’ could have some exposure to sub-prime products, but these would be part of a diversified portfolio. ", " The main risk of the fallout from the sub-prime problems related to the broad availability of credit, which by extension posed risks for activity in the US and other economies. It was likely that more exposures would emerge as hedge funds around the world would be forced to mark their positions to market, but as the market for these assets was not functioning, obtaining prices would be difficult. This could create a high degree of discomfort for many investors and could adversely affect the ability of those with excessive leverage to ride out the current period. ", " A consequence of the recent developments was a widening of market spreads, most significantly on low-rated corporate paper (junk bonds). It was important to note that while the price of debt had risen somewhat, there was also the important question over the quantity of finance that would be forthcoming. Some high-profile mergers and acquisitions had been withdrawn, which in themselves would not carry macroeconomic implications, but of greater consequence was the risk of contagion, namely the emergence of a generalised tightening of credit standards that could inhibit the capacity of businesses to borrow for investment. In this context, members noted that the proportion of US corporate debt that was sub-investment grade was now higher than during previous episodes of financial stress. They discussed the role of ratings agencies and possible regulatory issues that might arise in the current environment. ", " As a consequence of recent financial turbulence, US bond yields had reversed their rise of the previous two months, and were back at 4.75 per cent. Yields had also fallen on other bond markets, including Australia. The fall in government bond yields meant that, despite the rise in spreads, borrowing costs for AAA-rated issuers had actually fallen in the past month. ", " The turmoil in credit markets had spread to equity markets, which had also been volatile in recent weeks. However, the US market was still 2.5 per cent higher over the year to date and 15 per cent higher than the same period in 2006. The Australian market had generally outperformed others and was 5 per cent higher over the year to date, though had fallen by about 8 per cent since its peak in mid July. US financial sector stocks had seen their share prices fall sharply and this had particularly been the case for sub-prime lenders. Financial stocks overall were now back to their levels prevailing a year earlier. In Australia, Macquarie Bank's share price had fallen in tandem with US financial stocks, but it was still higher than a year earlier. ", " The problems in credit markets had seen an easing of monetary policy by the Fed again priced in by the end of the year. However, in Europe, the President of the European Central Bank indicated that the inclination was to raise policy rates at the next meeting. Over the past month, monetary policy had been tightened in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. ", " In China, several instruments of monetary policy had been tightened further over the past month as the economy gained strength and liquidity remained abundant. ", " Foreign exchange markets had been a little less volatile over the past month than earlier in the year. The US dollar had generally continued to decline and the yen had appreciated over the month, in a reversal of its recent depreciation ", " The Australian dollar had been volatile in the past few weeks. It had been rising strongly through the course of July, reaching US8 8.71 c, which was the highest level since February 1989, before falling sharply late in the month. Since then, the exchange rate had risen back to around US86c and 68.5 on the trade-weighted index. In effective terms, the Australian dollar had been relatively flat over the past month, though its deprecation against the yen and Swiss franc was an indication of heightened risk aversion in global markets. The currency nonetheless remained at a high level, and was 8 per cent higher on the TWI than a year earlier. ", " Following release of the June quarter CPI, market expectations had moved to a high probability of a tightening of monetary policy in Australia in August. Recent developments in financial markets had had little effect on these expectations. ", " Members briefly discussed changes in corporate gearing over recent years, against the background of rapid growth in business credit in the past year. They concluded that current leverage in the non-financial corporate sector was not at levels that would prompt concern, being about average relative to the past 25 years and concentrated in a few companies in the non-resources sector, notably utilities. "], "Information Paper – Labour Market Developments: A Longer-run Perspective": [" Members were briefed on the staff's assessment of longer-run trends in the sources of employment growth and the probable sources of future labour supply, in the context of the tightening of the labour market over recent years. ", " The key points discussed included the growing proportion of part-time employees in the workforce, to around 30 per cent of all employees, which had been associated with the changing industry composition of growth; the rising contribution of the services sector was of particular importance in this regard. Members also considered the contributions to employment growth from increases in skilled migration, increases in labour force participation and reductions in unemployment; each of these three components had contributed about one-third of the increase in employment growth in the past couple of years. Overall labour utilisation, according to an estimate of ‘full-time equivalents’, appeared to be relatively high but below previous cyclical highs. ", " The changes in trends in participation rates among males and females and among age cohorts were reviewed, with members being informed that the best prospects for further increases in labour supply in the near term would be from additional increases in the overall participation rate. Increases in participation in recent years had largely derived from older workers delaying retirement, and this could continue for some years given strong demand for labour and the fact that Australia had a comparatively low participation rate among older cohorts by international standards. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points in August, to 6.5 per cent. ", " In discussing the recommendation to tighten monetary policy, Board members noted that the macroeconomic case was clear. The latest assessments of the outlook for the world economy had seen forecasts for the current and following year revised upward. Domestically, recent economic data had signalled a pick-up in the pace of demand and activity, which had been accompanied by higher-than-expected underlying inflation, as indicated by the June quarter CPI. High rates of capacity utilisation, ongoing reductions in unemployment and strength in the demand for finance suggested that pressures on inflation would intensify over the period ahead. These pressures would be offset only slightly, and over an extended period, by the recent appreciation of the exchange rate. The forecast was that underlying inflation on a year-ended basis would now rise to the top of the target band over the next six months and remain there subsequently. ", " Members gave careful consideration to the effect on the outlook for activity and inflation in Australia of the recent events in financial markets, particularly in US credit markets. They noted that these developments were important and could lead to a higher degree of risk aversion among investors, which would pose downside risks to demand and output in the US economy if they persisted. However, these risks were more in the medium term and the extent to which they would flow through to global growth, and ultimately to inflation in Australia, was unclear. In any case, some slight dampening of the global growth outlook would be tolerable given that continuing high commodity prices remained an important source of stimulus to incomes and spending in Australia. It was not likely that a rise in the cash rate would, in itself, add to financial instability. ", " The case for a tightening in monetary policy had been building for some time. The main factor that had allowed time for further consideration was that, prior to this month, the two most recent inflation results had been unexpectedly subdued. The June quarter inflation result had changed this, as it had substantially lifted the outlook for inflation. Members judged that waiting further to see how events unfolded in credit markets may not clarify the picture in the near term, and that meanwhile a strong case existed for policy action now to forestall an unacceptable rise in inflation. ", " Taking all these matters into consideration, the Board judged that a somewhat more restrictive setting of monetary policy was required in order to keep inflation consistent with the target in the medium term. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should be increased by 25 basis points to 6.5 per cent, effective the following day. "]}},

Survey measures of business conditions in both the manufacturing and services sectors were at high levels and growth in industrial production had increased further. ", " There had been a significant increase in the growth of global merchandise trade volumes. Data on merchandise imports suggested that stronger demand from east Asia (excluding Japan) and the United States had been an important source of this growth. At the same time, merchandise imports to some other emerging markets had stopped falling. Members noted that many economies had benefited from this increase in demand for traded goods; merchandise exports from Australia, much of Asia (excluding China) and other emerging economies had grown particularly strongly. ", " GDP growth was expected to be above potential over 2017 in all three major advanced economies, supported by accommodative monetary policies. As a result, spare capacity in the labour markets of these economies was likely to continue to decline. ", " Global inflation had increased, driven by the rise in oil prices over 2016. However, oil prices had been relatively stable since late 2016 and core inflation rates had remained low in most economies. This suggested that headline inflation could decline unless the reduction in spare capacity in the major advanced economies generated greater inflationary pressures. ", " The Chinese economy appeared to have strengthened over recent months, supported by accommodative financial conditions and increased public spending. Conditions in the residential property market had remained buoyant, although housing price growth had slowed sharply in those cities where policies to constrain speculative housing activity and price growth had been implemented. Growth in dwelling investment had increased over 2016 and growth in investment in the manufacturing sector had been stable since mid 2016. Members noted that growth in infrastructure investment had remained strong and had been significantly affected by policy settings in the past. ", " In the United States, household consumption was expected to be the key driver of expenditure growth, partly because of low borrowing costs and further improvements in labour market conditions and despite some indications that consumption growth had been weak at the start of 2017. In addition, investment intentions of the business sector had risen sharply. The risk of more protectionist policies remained, which could harm growth, but it was unclear what form these policies might take. ", " The prices of iron ore, oil and coking coal had declined since the previous meeting, but remained well above the lows of 2016. Other commodity prices had been little changed over the prior month. Members noted that the damage caused by Cyclone Debbie was likely to disrupt coking coal production in the Bowen Basin for a short time. Given that this is one of the largest coking coal-producing regions in the world (and accounts for around one-third of Australia's coal exports), short-term price increases were likely. ", " Members noted that iron ore production costs had declined significantly over the past five years and that Australian and Brazilian iron ore mines accounted for most of the lowest-cost iron ore production. Some Chinese producers had costs that were higher than the current iron ore price, partly because the quality of the iron ore deposits was relatively low. However, some of these mines remained open, possibly reflecting their vertical integration with steel mills, which were often state owned and accounted for a significant share of employment in particular regions. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that conditions in the labour market had been somewhat weaker than had been expected. The unemployment rate had increased to 5.9 per cent in February and measures of underemployment – which capture workers who are willing and available to work more hours – had remained high. Overall, the ongoing spare capacity in the labour market was contributing to low wage growth outcomes. ", " Employment had declined a little in February but had increased by around 1 per cent over the preceding year; all of this growth had been in part-time employment. Employment outcomes had been strongest in Victoria, which had also experienced an increase in population growth following a rise in migration from other states and overseas. In contrast, employment outcomes had been weaker in New South Wales; employment conditions appeared to have remained strong in metropolitan Sydney, but had been relatively weak in regional areas. Employment outcomes in Western Australia were no longer deteriorating. Members noted that the adjustment of the labour market to changes in the locations and industries that were driving employment growth had not significantly boosted measures of structural unemployment. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand at the state level had been consistent with outcomes in the labour force data and continued to imply that aggregate employment growth could rise over coming months. However, members noted that these forward-looking indicators had been suggesting more positive employment outcomes than had been realised for some time. ", " Overall, GDP was likely to have expanded at a moderate rate in the March quarter. Early indications were that supply disruptions following Cyclone Debbie in Queensland and the floods in northern New South Wales were likely to be concentrated in coal production and some specific crops. At the time of the meeting, the overall effect on consumer prices and domestic demand growth, including from repairs and rebuilding, was not expected to be large. Survey measures of business conditions and confidence had remained above average. ", " Members observed that most of the large projects associated with the expansion of iron ore and coal production capacity in Australia had been completed. The remaining decline in mining investment expected over the subsequent year or so would, members noted, largely reflect the completion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. Members discussed the high and rising supply of LNG into the Asian market over coming years and the implications for spot prices and Australian export volumes. ", " Indicators of household consumption had been a little weaker than expected in early 2017. The value of retail sales had fallen slightly in February, following average growth in January, and households' perceptions of their personal finances had declined to below-average levels. Retail price inflation had remained subdued, partly because competition had remained strong across the retail sector. Members noted that utilities prices were expected to put some upward pressure on retail costs, but that retail rents had been flat – or rising very marginally at most – across the major cities. ", " Conditions in the established housing market had continued to vary significantly by region. Housing price growth had been strongest in detached housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne and some indicators for the established housing markets in these cities had picked up in the preceding couple of months. In contrast, housing market conditions in Perth had remained weak, although there were signs that prices there may be stabilising. Vacancy rates had been increasing, particularly in Perth. Strong growth in the supply of new apartments was continuing to drive a wedge between price growth for apartments and detached houses in Melbourne and Brisbane. Private residential building approvals had rebounded in February; the large pipeline of work to be done was expected to support dwelling investment over the subsequent year or two. ", " Growth in housing credit to owner-occupiers had moderated slightly over the preceding six months, while growth in housing credit to investors had increased, although investor loan approvals had declined in February. Most of the increase in lending to investors had occurred in New South Wales and Victoria, which was consistent with the pattern of housing market activity. Members observed that the growth of housing credit to investors had initially moderated in response to the announcement by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) of a 10 per cent benchmark for investor credit growth in late 2014. In addition, the share of lending with high loan-to-valuation ratios had fallen. However, growth in investor credit had increased steadily since early 2016, despite the fact that banks had tightened lending standards and, on average, increased the margin between interest rates on investor housing loans and those on loans to owner-occupiers. "], "Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of financial markets with the observation that conditions generally had been relatively stable over the preceding month. ", " Members noted that the increase in the US federal funds rate in March had been well anticipated. Despite two increases in the federal funds rate since late 2016, financial conditions in the United States had eased slightly, including via a depreciation of the US dollar, a decline in corporate bond yields and a rise in equity prices. At the March meeting, the assessment by members of the Federal Open Market Committee of the appropriate course for monetary policy was unchanged, with the median projection being for two further increases in the policy rate in 2017. Market pricing continued to suggest a slightly slower pace of tightening than the official projections. ", " The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan had both left their policies unchanged in the prior month, while noting that domestic economic activity was improving. Market pricing implied that participants did not expect a further reduction in the ECB's deposit rate and, indeed, had some expectation of a small increase in the deposit rate by mid 2018. ", " There had been a marginal tightening in money market conditions in China in March, via another small increase in the cost of various lending facilities provided by the People's Bank of China. The renminbi had depreciated slightly on a trade-weighted basis, moving in line with the US dollar; this took it to its lowest level on a trade-weighted basis since 2014. Official reserve assets in China had stabilised around US$3 trillion and there appeared to have been some net private inflows of capital of late. ", " Conditions in sovereign bond markets had not changed noticeably over the prior month. The United Kingdom's formal notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union had had little effect on financial market prices in the United Kingdom, with both the value of the pound and gilt yields little changed. ", " In Australian financial markets, government bond yields had been little changed over the prior month. Australian equity prices had increased and were noticeably higher than a year earlier. Prices of resource companies had declined in the preceding few months while prices of shares in other sectors, particularly the financial sector, had increased over March. ", " The Australian dollar was broadly unchanged against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the preceding month, but had appreciated over the previous year. ", " Members discussed the recently announced increases in housing lending rates. The increases had been mainly in response to prudential measures introduced by APRA in 2014 to slow the growth in lending to housing investors and preceded measures announced by APRA in late March to restrain the growth of interest-only lending. Funding costs had not changed significantly. At the point that these latest increases were to come into effect, the cumulative increase since November would be an average of around 25 basis points for loans to investors with scheduled repayments of principal and interest, and only a slight increase for loans of this type to owner-occupiers. In addition, by April the four major banks all would have introduced higher interest rates for interest-only lending, with an average premium relative to principal and interest lending of around 15 basis points. As a result, investors with interest-only loans on variable rates would be facing benchmark interest rates similar to those that applied to the same product about three years earlier. Members noted that the margin between lending rates on principal and interest loans and interest-only loans had increased by more for owner-occupiers than for investors. ", " Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities by Australian financial entities had been strong in the preceding few months, although this represented a small share of total lending and remained well below pre-financial crisis levels. ", " Members noted that pricing in financial markets indicated no expectation of a change in the cash rate at the April meeting or over the remainder of the year. "], "Financial Stability": ["Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the stability of the financial system. ", " Risks related to household debt and the housing market more generally had increased over the preceding six months. However, the nature of those risks differed across the country, according to the varying conditions and activity in local markets. Although credit to the household sector had been growing modestly relative to history, growth had been faster than income growth and the aggregate debt-to-income ratio for households had increased. ", " Nevertheless, indicators of financial stress in the household sector remained contained. Low interest rates and improved lending standards over recent years had been supporting households' ability to service debt, and households on average had continued to build repayment buffers. Members noted, however, that some households with home loans appeared to have little or no buffer of excess mortgage repayments and could be vulnerable if household income were lower than expected. This observation emphasised the importance of realistic assessments of household expenses and prudent lending standards for mitigating risks to both financial stability and macroeconomic outcomes. ", " Members discussed the recent actions taken by APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to support prudent lending practices. These actions had been focused particularly on interest-only lending, serviceability assessments and responsible lending practices. APRA's guidance had included limits on the share of interest-only loans in new housing loans and a requirement that banks impose strict limits on new interest-only lending at high loan-to-valuation ratios. Members recognised that the calibration of this guidance was not precise or straightforward. Developments needed to be kept under review and, depending on how the system responds to the various measures, members noted that the Council of Financial Regulators would consider further measures if needed. ", " Members observed that a number of factors make interest-only loans attractive in the Australian context. In particular, interest-only loans allow investors to take greatest advantage of particular features of the tax system, while the availability of offset accounts provides some owner-occupiers with opportunities to manage liquidity risks that might be associated with irregular income, for example. ", " Members noted that some banks had curtailed lending to some segments of the housing market, notably the Brisbane apartment market, where the supply of apartments was expected to increase significantly, raising the risks associated with oversupply. Reports of settlement failures had remained isolated. Members also noted the higher interest rates facing most investors, especially those with interest-only loans. ", " Developments in commercial property markets mirrored the geographic pattern seen in residential property markets. Conditions had been strengthening in Sydney and Melbourne but were weaker elsewhere. Valuations were generally high, however, and posed some risk to leveraged investors if prices were to decline sharply. Members were briefed on APRA's recent review of commercial property lending. This review revealed some instances of weak underwriting standards and poor monitoring of risk profiles among lenders; several Australian banks had since tightened their lending standards. ", " Members observed that, in contrast to the growing risks faced by the household sector, vulnerabilities in the non-financial business sector remained low. Outside Western Australia, business failure rates had declined. Profitability had been supported by higher earnings for resource-related firms, following the increase in commodity prices. Gearing ratios and other measures of the strength of businesses' balance sheets had generally been around their historical averages. ", " Members noted that the Australian banks continued to be well placed to manage the challenges they faced. The banks remained highly profitable in the second half of 2016 and the performance of their assets had been little changed. Their capital ratios and liquidity structures had strengthened over the prior year or so. Members noted that further increases in capital could be expected once APRA finalises its new standards to ensure that banks are 'unquestionably strong', and that banks were expected to be able to accumulate any required additional capital. The domestic banks had also taken steps to reduce the risk profile of their balance sheets, having divested some higher-risk and low-return assets in recent years. In addition, they had tended to slow the growth in their exposures to commercial property, particularly residential and land development lending. Some risks from their businesses in New Zealand had probably diminished, as global milk prices had risen, although risks related to housing markets in New Zealand remained. ", " Members observed that the nature of the risks to global financial stability had changed over the preceding six months as the economic outlook had improved and longer-term interest rates had risen. In particular, there was an increased risk that future portfolio adjustments could prove disruptive. Prices of some assets had reached high levels, which could reverse if interest rates rose particularly quickly or if the outlook for growth in some economies were reassessed. Risks related to some international political developments had also increased over the preceding six months, although markets had generally reacted in an orderly manner so far. ", " Members noted that longstanding vulnerabilities remained in some banking systems overseas. Performance of the European banking sector had remained weak, weighed down by high levels of non-performing loans, relatively high cost bases and other legacy issues. Low profitability impeded these banks' ability to improve their capital positions. Risks also remained elevated in China. Debt levels had continued to grow rapidly, particularly debt acquired through less regulated channels and possibly by higher-risk borrowers. Some measures of loan performance had deteriorated. Slowing growth in profits in some industries could impinge on some borrowers' capacity to service their debts. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that recent data had provided more confidence that global growth was rising and that the pick-up was broadly based across both developed and emerging economies. Growth in both global trade and industrial production had increased and indicators of global consumer and business sentiment had been above average. Further reductions in spare capacity were expected in the major advanced economies. However, various policy, financial and geopolitical risks would still need to be closely watched. ", " Headline inflation had increased in most economies, mainly reflecting higher oil prices over the first part of 2016. Members noted that, while the effect of higher oil prices might dissipate, further reductions in spare capacity in the major advanced economies could be expected to see a lift in inflation. ", " The improvement in global economic conditions had contributed to higher commodity prices overall. This was expected to have provided a significant boost to Australia's national income in the March quarter. However, iron ore prices had fallen since late March, which suggested that the Australian terms of trade were still likely to decline in the period ahead from their recent highs. ", " Recent data suggested that the Australian economy had continued to grow moderately at the beginning of 2017, supported by the low level of interest rates. Indicators of household consumption had been a little weaker than expected, which was consistent with softer conditions in the labour market. Although forward-looking indicators of labour demand continued to suggest an increase in employment growth over the period ahead, this had been true for some time without leading to an improvement in labour market conditions. Most measures of business confidence were at, or above, average and non-mining business investment had risen over the prior year in parts of the country less affected by the transition following the end of the mining investment boom. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had assisted the economy during this transition; an appreciating exchange rate would complicate the adjustment process. ", " Conditions in housing markets continued to vary considerably across the country. The established markets in Sydney and Melbourne appeared to have strengthened further, but housing prices had continued to fall in Perth. The additional supply of apartments scheduled to come on stream over the subsequent couple of years in the eastern capital cities was expected to put some downward pressure on growth in apartment prices and rents, particularly in Brisbane. ", " Growth in housing credit continued to outpace growth in household incomes, suggesting that the risks associated with the housing market and household balance sheets had been rising. Recently announced supervisory measures were designed to help mitigate these risks by reinforcing prudent lending standards and ensuring that loan serviceability was appropriate for current conditions. Less reliance on interest-only housing loans was also expected to increase the resilience of household balance sheets. However, it would take some time to assess fully the effects of the recent pricing changes and the increased supervisory attention. ", " Headline inflation was expected to pick up over 2017 to be above 2 per cent. However, the rise in underlying inflation was expected to be more gradual; wage growth and broader measures of labour cost pressures remained subdued and competition in the retail sector continued to be strong. ", " Taking into account the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. The Board judged that developments in the labour and housing markets warranted careful monitoring over coming months. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 2 May 2017"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AM, Catherine Tanna "], "Others present": [" Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic conditions by noting that inflation outcomes for the March quarter had been in line with forecasts presented in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. As such, the March quarter inflation data had generally increased confidence in the forecast that underlying inflation would pick up to around 2 per cent by early 2018. Both headline and underlying measures of inflation had been ½ per cent in the March quarter. In year-ended terms, headline inflation had been a little above 2 per cent and underlying inflation had increased to around 1¾ per cent. Higher petrol prices and the increase in tobacco excise had both made sizeable contributions to headline inflation; increases in tobacco excise were expected to continue adding to headline inflation over the forecast period. Members noted that the ABS would issue revised expenditure weights for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the December quarter 2017 CPI release, which would reflect changes in consumption behaviour over the preceding six years in response to factors including large changes in relative prices. ", " Prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items) had been little changed in the March quarter but fell over the prior year. Strong competitive pressures in the retail sector had helped keep retail inflation low and there were signs that these pressures were affecting a broader range of consumer goods, such as furniture and household appliances. The appreciation of the exchange rate over the prior year is likely to have weighed on consumer prices. ", " Non-tradables inflation (excluding tobacco) had stabilised over preceding quarters. There had been signs of stronger price pressures in a few components, including an increase in new dwelling construction costs, which largely reflected a rise in the cost of materials. Utilities prices had also increased strongly in some cities in the March quarter, reflecting the pass-through to consumers of higher wholesale costs for gas and electricity. Members noted that utilities prices in other cities were likely to increase in the next few quarters and that there could be second-round effects on the CPI through upward pressure on business costs. ", " Working in the other direction, low wage growth and strong competition in the retail sector had contributed to domestic cost pressures remaining subdued. Rent inflation had remained persistently low and was around its lowest level in over 20 years, partly because rents had fallen significantly in Perth. Inflation in a range of administered prices, such as those for education, child care and pharmaceuticals, had been lower than usual, largely reflecting changes in government policy and the benchmarking of some administered prices to the CPI. ", " GDP growth over 2016 had been around 2½ per cent. Data that had become available over April suggested that the domestic economy had continued to expand at a moderate pace in the March quarter. Members noted that growth in domestic output was still expected to pick up to be a little above 3 per cent by the first half of 2018, as the drag from declining mining investment waned and as resource exports continued to pick up. ", " The impact of Cyclone Debbie had been most apparent in the spot price of coking coal, which had increased sharply after damage to key infrastructure affected coking coal exports from the Bowen Basin. Coking coal export volumes were expected to be significantly lower in the June quarter before returning to their previous levels over the remainder of 2017 as the damaged infrastructure is restored. Iron ore and liquefied natural gas exports were expected to make significant contributions to growth over the forecast period. Iron ore prices had fallen over the prior month, as had been expected for some time, and oil prices had been lower. ", " Although Australia's terms of trade were expected to be higher in the near term than had been forecast at the time of the February <cite>Statement</cite>, much of the increase in the terms of trade since mid 2016 was expected to unwind over the next few years. As such, the recent rise in the terms of trade was not expected to result in materially more mining investment. However, members noted that the recent boost to mining profits could have other spillover effects, such as higher dividend payments, wage outcomes or government revenues, which represented an upside risk to the forecasts. ", " Recent data on retail sales growth and households' perceptions of their personal finances suggested that consumption growth had moderated somewhat in early 2017. Further out, consumption was still forecast to expand at a bit above its average rate of recent years, consistent with the forecasts made at the time of the February <cite>Statement</cite>. Members noted that if the upside risks to household income growth from the higher terms of trade were realised, consumption growth could be stronger. On the other hand, if households were becoming more focused on paying down debt, this would imply some downside risks to the outlook for household consumption growth. A fall in housing prices could also weigh on consumption growth. ", " The large amount of residential construction still in progress was expected to support dwelling investment in the near term. Building approvals had been lower over prior months, particularly for higher-density dwellings, suggesting that this pipeline of construction work would continue to be worked off in coming quarters. Members noted that changes in the rate of home-building lag changes in population growth and that this had affected housing prices in some markets in the preceding few years. Growth in housing prices had remained brisk in Sydney and Melbourne, where population growth had been relatively strong, but had been weak in Perth, where population growth had fallen significantly following the end of the mining investment boom. At the same time, there had been some indications that the large increase in supply in the inner-city Melbourne and Brisbane apartment markets had weighed on prices, particularly in the case of Brisbane. ", " Members noted that surveys of business conditions had continued to improve and that some survey measures of investment intentions had picked up. However, other measures of investment intentions, including those recorded in the ABS capital expenditure survey, suggested that it could be some time before a stronger and more broadly based pick-up in non-mining business investment growth occurs. Other recent indicators of non-mining business investment, including non-residential building approvals and the pipeline of non-residential construction work, were still quite soft. The pipeline of outstanding public infrastructure work, however, had increased further. ", " Members observed that the unemployment rate had edged slightly higher in recent months to 5.9 per cent, but was expected to decline gradually over the forecast period. Members noted that this suggested spare capacity would remain in the labour market, although there was significant uncertainty about how to measure the degree of spare capacity, particularly given the higher levels of underemployment in recent years. An increase in labour demand could, in the first instance, be met partly by increasing hours worked by part-time employees, which would reduce measures of underemployment but represent an upside risk to the unemployment rate forecasts. The participation rate was slightly higher than had been forecast three months earlier and was assumed to remain around current levels throughout the forecast period. ", " Employment growth over the March quarter had increased and full-time employment had continued to rise. Members noted that this was in contrast to 2016, when all of the growth had been in part-time employment. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, including data on vacancies and surveyed employment intentions, indicated that employment growth would pick up a little. Wage growth was expected to increase gradually as labour market conditions improved and the adjustment to the lower mining investment and terms of trade drew to an end. ", " Members had an in-depth discussion about changes in the composition of employment in recent decades. They discussed the implications of the secular upward trend in the share of part-time employment for labour market spare capacity. The share of part-time employment in Australia, which had increased from around 10 per cent in the early 1970s to over one-third at present, was relatively high by international standards, especially for younger workers; one driver is that students in Australia are more likely to combine their studies with part-time jobs. Data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey suggested that the majority of part-time workers worked part-time as a matter of choice given their personal circumstances, which vary across their lifecycle. People aged between 15 and 24 years are more likely to work part-time at the same time as studying, while a significant share of women between the ages of 25 and 44 years cite child-caring responsibilities as their main reason for working part-time. Furthermore, some older workers indicate a preference for working part-time, possibly as part of their transition to retirement. The survey also indicated that some part-time workers cite a lack of full-time opportunities or that their work requires part-time hours as the main reason for working part-time. ", " Members observed that growth in part-time employment had become more cyclical over time because businesses had been more able to respond to changes in demand by adjusting the hours worked by employees rather than the number of employees. This increase in labour market flexibility had been enabled by a range of factors including labour market deregulation, technological change and the shift towards a more service-based economy. As a result, the distinction between full-time and part-time work had become less important in assessing labour market conditions. In addition, understanding the degree of spare capacity in the economy required an assessment of the additional hours part-time workers were willing and able to contribute as well as the number of unemployed people. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners had picked up since mid 2016 and most forecasters had revised up their outlook for global growth. Recent data had generally confirmed this improved outlook. The stronger activity had been evident in a pick-up in various indicators, including industrial production and measures of business and consumer sentiment, as well as in a broad-based rise in global trade. For some countries, including the United States, Japan and Korea, this had been reflected in an increase in the growth of business investment. ", " Economic growth in China had retained momentum in early 2017. Property construction and government spending on infrastructure had been among the important drivers of growth and had supported Chinese demand for Australian iron ore and coal as inputs into steel production. The share of investment in nominal GDP had fallen in recent years, while the share of consumption had been rising. Members observed that as economies matured, the share of services in consumption generally increased, which was consistent with the rising share of services in Chinese economic output. Risks around rapid housing price growth had remained a source of concern for the authorities and some ratcheting up of tightening measures had been needed to contain housing price inflation and speculative activity. Members noted that the outlook for the Chinese economy, particularly the residential property market, was an ongoing source of uncertainty for Australian exports and the terms of trade. Another source of uncertainty was how the Chinese authorities might balance achieving their growth targets with the risks associated with high and rising leverage in the Chinese economy. ", " In the United States, consumption growth had slowed in the March quarter, although this was likely to have been temporary. At the same time, there had been an increase in business investment growth, some of which was related to the energy sector. Survey measures had suggested that the prospects for further growth in business investment were favourable. The unemployment rate had fallen to a level consistent with full employment, while GDP growth was still expected to be above potential over the next couple of years. ", " Members noted that growth in the euro area was expected to continue at around its recent pace in early 2017. Business credit had increased since late 2016, having declined for a number of years, and the unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest level in nearly eight years. Members noted that the unemployment rate was particularly low in Germany, but had been persistently high in some other countries in the euro area, including France. The Japanese labour market had tightened further and economic growth had exceeded estimates of potential growth in Japan over recent years. Wage growth in Japan had increased a little, but core inflation had remained close to zero and inflation expectations were low. ", " Core inflation in the major advanced economies had generally remained low. Headline inflation had risen in recent quarters, but was likely to fall back because the effect of the earlier increase in oil prices had started to dissipate. Core inflation was expected to rise gradually in the major advanced economies as spare capacity in labour markets declined further. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that financial markets had been relatively stable over recent months and global financial conditions generally remained very favourable. Heightened geopolitical tensions and various political developments had had little effect on financial markets. ", " Members noted that the widening of the yield spread between French government bonds and German Bunds ahead of the French presidential election had partly unwound following the result of the first round of voting. Members observed that long-term sovereign bond yields in the major markets had remained higher than in the preceding year, but were still low in a historical context. ", " The Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged at its April meeting, but stated that more quantitative easing would be undertaken if needed to reach the inflation target. The European Central Bank also left policy unchanged at its April meeting. Market participants did not expect the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to change monetary policy at its May meeting. Market expectations were for three increases in the federal funds rate by the end of 2018, compared with five increases implied by the median projections of FOMC members. ", " Chinese financial market conditions had tightened following the announcement of regulatory measures aimed at reducing leverage in financial markets. Short-term money market rates had risen and corporate bond financing had declined since the end of 2016. ", " Share prices in major markets had risen over the prior month and equity market valuations remained at high levels. Corporate bond yields generally remained very low, with spreads to government bonds having narrowed over the prior year. Corporate bond yields had mostly moved in line with sovereign bond yields over the prior month, except in China, where yields had increased following announcements by the authorities aimed at addressing high and rising leverage. ", " Members noted that the cost of borrowing US dollars in short-term foreign exchange swap and bank funding markets had declined from the high levels of 2016, reflecting both demand and supply factors. ", " There had been relatively little change in major exchange rates over the prior month. The Australian dollar had been little changed against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the prior month, but had depreciated slightly over the previous few months, which was consistent with the decline in commodity prices. ", " Australian government and corporate bond yields had generally moved in line with global bond markets over preceding months. Corporate bond issuance had remained relatively subdued, with resource-related corporations using their higher cash flows to reduce debt. ", " Australian share prices had increased a little over the prior month, with the exception of resource stocks, which had fallen in response to lower iron ore prices. ", " Members observed that housing credit growth had steadied in early 2017. Growth in investor housing credit had been rising for a time, but had stabilised in preceding months, consistent with the decline in loan approvals to investors. Household credit overall had grown at an annualised rate of 6 per cent over the six months to March. Variable housing interest rates had increased since late 2016, particularly for investors and interest-only lending. As a result, the average estimated interest rate on major banks' outstanding housing lending had increased slightly, while the average cost of funding was estimated to have been little changed. ", " Financial market pricing indicated that market participants expected the cash rate to remain unchanged at the May meeting and over the remainder of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the outlook for the global economy remained positive. The broad-based nature of the data supporting this outlook provided some confidence that the expansion could become self-reinforcing. At the same time, the improved conditions and ongoing accommodative stance of monetary policy globally had not, to date, led to a sustained increase in inflation. Members noted that various policy, financial and geopolitical risks to the ongoing expansion in the global economy were still present. The improvement in global economic conditions had helped to support commodity prices, although recent commodity price movements had also been affected by commodity-specific supply factors, such as disruptions to Australian coking coal exports following Cyclone Debbie. ", " Domestically, inflation outcomes had been as expected in the March quarter. The central forecast for headline inflation was that it would be above 2 per cent over the forecast period; underlying inflation was expected to increase gradually from its current rate of 1¾ per cent. Subdued growth in labour costs and strong competition in the retail sector had continued to have a dampening effect on aggregate inflation. Working in the other direction, rises in utilities prices and the cost of new dwelling construction had increased inflationary pressures. ", " Members noted that, although it seemed unlikely that wage growth would slow much further, wage pressures were expected to rise only gradually as the effects of structural adjustment following the mining investment and terms of trade boom, which had weighed on aggregate wage growth, continued to wane. Data on the labour market had been somewhat mixed, but forward-looking indicators continued to suggest that employment growth would maintain its recent pace and spare capacity in the labour market would decline gradually. ", " Recent data suggested that the Australian economy had grown at a moderate pace at the beginning of 2017. The outlook was little changed from three months earlier and continued to be supported by the increase in the terms of trade and the low level of interest rates, although lenders had announced increases in mortgage rates, particularly those paid by investors and on interest-only loans. The pick-up in non-mining business investment had been modest and forward-looking indicators of investment remained mixed. The drag from the fall in mining investment (and the spillover effects of this on non-mining investment and activity) had continued to ease. Recent data had provided further signs that the downswings in the Western Australian and Queensland economies were coming to an end. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had assisted the economy through this transition; an appreciation of the exchange rate would complicate this adjustment process. ", " Conditions in the housing market continued to vary considerably across the country. Conditions in established housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne remained robust, but housing prices had been falling in Perth. The additional supply of apartments scheduled to be completed over the next couple of years in the eastern capital cities was expected to put some downward pressure on growth in apartment prices and on rents, particularly in Brisbane. ", " Growth in housing credit had continued to outpace growth in household incomes, which suggested that the risks associated with household balance sheets had been rising. Recently announced supervisory measures were designed to help mitigate these risks by reinforcing prudent lending standards and ensuring that loan serviceability was appropriate for current financial and housing market conditions. However, it would take some time to assess the full effects of recent increases in mortgage rates and the additional supervisory focus. ", " The Board continued to judge that developments in the labour and housing markets warranted careful monitoring. Taking into account all the available information and the updated forecasts, the Board's assessment was that maintaining the current accommodative stance of monetary policy would be consistent with achieving sustainable growth and the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},

"], "Inflation": [" Members were briefed on the latest inflation outcomes. The September quarter CPI had increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.9 per cent</span> in underlying terms, maintaining the relatively fast pace of the previous quarter. These increases had lifted underlying inflation to 3 per cent in year-ended terms. ", " The CPI had increased by 0.7 per cent in the quarter. The difference between this figure and the underlying rate was in the treatment of the childcare rebate reducing the CPI, with the net effect of other volatile factors roughly neutral in the quarter. The annual increase in the CPI was 1.9 per cent. As well as the effects of the childcare rebate in the latest quarter, this increase was held down by falls in petrol and banana prices over the past year. The year-ended increase in the CPI was expected to exceed 3 per cent by early next year as these passed out of the calculation. ", " The increase in the non-tradable items in the CPI, which was driven mainly by services prices, had been close to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> over the year to the September quarter, while year-ended inflation of tradables, which was driven mainly by goods prices, was well below 1 per cent. Some disinflation in tradable goods prices was expected as a result of the latest appreciation of the exchange rate, but the effect was likely to be mild. Non-tradables inflation was expected to strengthen further. ", " The staff forecast for underlying inflation, in the absence of any monetary policy tightening, was for it to rise to around 3¼ per cent in the next couple of quarters, after which it would gradually ease to just above 3 per cent by the end of 2008 and into 2009. The forecast for CPI inflation was for it to rise relatively sharply in the next two quarters, to around 3½ per cent, and then settle at a rate also just above 3 per cent by the second half of 2008. The forecast for an easing of inflation in a year's time was predicated on a softening in the growth of domestic and global demand and a dampening effect on prices from the appreciation of the exchange rate. Wages growth was expected to rise a little over the forecast period. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted the recent changes to fiscal policy projections. At the time of the Australian Government's May budget, the surplus had been forecast to be around 1 per cent of GDP in 2007/08 and to rise gradually in subsequent years. Since May, parameter variations had suggested an increase in the surplus to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per  cent</span> of GDP over the period covered by the forward estimates. New expenditure and revenue measures announced since the budget and in the early part of the election campaign had since reduced the projected surplus to around 1 per cent of GDP. This meant that fiscal policy was roughly neutral in its overall effect on growth as conventionally measured, the recent initiatives having offset the ‘automatic fiscal stabilisers’. ", " Discussion then turned to the regular economic data releases. ", " Business conditions in the September quarter, according to the NAB survey, were higher than a year earlier and around the highest levels on record. ", " Credit growth had resumed its upward trend in the past few months due to the impact of business borrowing, which was now rising at <span class=\"no-wrap\">26 per  cent</span> on a six-month-ended annualised basis. The rate of growth of household borrowing, on the other hand, was at the low end of the range seen over the past decade. ", " Retail sales had increased by 8 per cent in nominal terms over the past year, up from the <span class=\"no-wrap\">6–7 per cent</span> rate seen over the previous year or so. Retail sales had increased strongly in real terms in the September quarter. In a further sign of strength for consumer spending in the second half of the year, motor vehicle sales had continued to increase in the past few months, to be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> higher than average levels in 2006. ", " Housing loan approvals and credit growth had both fallen since mid year, following a pick-up in the first half of the year. This may have been due to an easing in the demand for finance following the increase in interest rates in August, but the unwinding of the sharp superannuation-related increase in credit growth in June made it difficult to discern recent trends. ", " House prices had increased more strongly in the September quarter. The rises were broadly based, with particular strength over the past year in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide. Auction clearance rates had remained at high levels in both Sydney and Melbourne in both September and October. ", " Housing construction had continued the weakness seen in recent years. The current level of commencements was below the underlying demand for dwellings, suggesting that there was an emerging build-up of excess demand. In due course, this could be expected to generate an upswing in housing construction, which would add to the growth in overall economic activity. ", " Conditions in the rural sector were weak. Estimates of wheat production in 2007/08 had been progressively revised down given the paucity of follow-up rainfall during winter, and the latest estimate was for only a modest increase on the level of production in the drought year of 2006/07. The recent rainfall in some cropping areas would have little effect on the wheat harvest, but could benefit summer crops. Members noted that two consecutive years of wheat production at such low levels had not been seen since the mid 1940s. Inflows into the Murray-Darling Basin, measured on the basis of two-year cumulative inflows, were the lowest on record. Farm output was now forecast to increase by only 4 per cent in 2007/08, following the <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span> fall in the previous year. ", " The run of positive labour market indicators had continued in September. Employment had increased at an above-average pace over the past year and the unemployment rate had declined. In confirmation that the labour market remained tight, business surveys indicated that the availability of suitable labour was the main factor constraining output, and this had become more important over the past year or so. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Discussion of the world economy noted that since July there had been a downward revision of ½ percentage point to the forecast for global growth in 2008. Nonetheless, the forecast of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4¾ per cent</span> was still well above the average of the past three decades. The composition of growth was skewed to the emerging economies, which were expected to grow at an above-average pace. In contrast, the G7 countries were expected to grow at a below-average rate for the second consecutive year. ", " The US economy had slowed since 2006, though the latest national accounts data had showed unexpectedly strong GDP growth in the September quarter; year-ended growth was moderate at 2½ per cent. Excluding the effect of the downturn in residential investment, GDP increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 ½ per cent</span> over the year to the September quarter. Activity in the housing sector remained weak, with leading indicators of activity and the stock of new houses falling further in recent months. There was little sign of a levelling out in the ratio of the stock of unsold houses to sales of houses. Despite the sharp downturn in the housing sector, other parts of the economy had been resilient and employment had recorded a strong rise in October. ", " Data on industrial production indicated that the pace of growth in the euro area had slowed over the past year. Indicators of consumer and business sentiment in the euro area had softened. Overall growth was expected to be moderate in the period ahead. ", " Growth in the Chinese economy had strengthened over the past year, which had provided a positive stimulus to other economies in east Asia. Year-ended GDP growth in Singapore and Korea had increased in recent quarters, and growth in industrial production in the east Asian region as a whole had increased steadily since the beginning of the year. ", " There had been further increases in commodity prices in the past few months. The price of a barrel of WTI crude oil was now well over US$90. While part of the latest increase reflected the depreciation of the US dollar, the oil price had also risen in SDR terms. Ongoing strong global demand for coal and iron ore, important bulk commodity exports from Australia, suggested substantial increases in contract prices were likely in 2008. "], "Financial Markets": [" There had been large fluctuations in sentiment in financial markets during the past month, but on balance it had improved, helped by the policy easing by the US Federal Reserve. ", " The reduction in the fed funds rate of 25 basis points in late October had been fully anticipated by the market. The Fed's statement accompanying the policy easing indicated that the downside risks to growth were balanced by the upside risks to inflation. The market nonetheless continued to expect further cuts to the fed funds rate. ", " There had been no change in monetary policy in the other major economies, though Sweden had lifted interest rates. Monetary policy was being tightened in many emerging economies. In China, the required reserves ratio had been lifted further, as the People's Bank of China attempted to offset the increase in domestic liquidity arising from the accumulation of foreign reserves. ", " In capital markets, LIBOR spreads had come down for both the US dollar and euro, particularly for the one-month maturity. Spreads at the three-month maturity had also fallen but not to the same extent. Announcement of significant write-downs by some large investment banks had caused nervousness in markets. More write-downs were expected in the fourth quarter. ", " The improvement in sentiment had been more pronounced in Australia. Three-month bank bill and LIBOR spreads had fallen substantially from the peak levels reached at the height of the credit market disruptions. They were still above the lows prevailing in the past few years, though it was unlikely that market pricing would return to those low levels in the near term, as risk was now being priced more realistically. ", " Government bond yields in the major countries had fluctuated in quite a wide range over the past month, ending the month around the low end of the range. The spread between US and German yields had narrowed significantly. ", " The spread between Australian and US bond yields had risen considerably over the past few months, reaching over 190 basis points, the highest for some time. This suggested that markets perceived a significant difference in the outlook for the two economies. ", " Corporate spreads in the United States had been relatively flat over the past month, remaining around the levels prevailing after the start of the credit crisis. Notably, prime borrowers had faced lower funding costs in recent months because yields on Treasury instruments had fallen by more than spreads had risen. ", " Share prices globally had recorded reasonable gains in the past month, but gains in the larger markets were held back by weakness of financial stocks. Share prices in emerging markets had been particularly strong, notably in India, despite regulatory attempts to slow inflows of foreign capital, and in Indonesia. Chinese share prices had continued to rise very sharply. ", " In Australia, the performance of the financial sector, in particular the banks, stood in sharp contrast to that in the United States. Australian banks had reported strong growth in earnings in the half-year to September. No write-downs in asset values related to US sub-prime loans and structured debt were reported, as exposure to these instruments was negligible. The Australian share market had outperformed its international peers because of the strength of the resources sector and comparatively better performance of financial stocks. While there had been little change overall over the past month, the Australian market was about 18 per cent higher over the year to date, with resource stocks increasing by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 per cent</span> over that period. ", " Margin lending in Australia fell in the September quarter. Margin calls had increased, but they were still low as gearing was quite conservative. These developments did not suggest investors were having any problems in meeting their obligations and, in any event, market indices had subsequently risen. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the main development over the past month was the further depreciation of the US dollar, which had reached record low levels in nominal and real trade-weighted terms, falling by about 12 per cent over the past year. ", " The renmimbi had also appreciated by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> against the US dollar over the year, but in trade-weighted terms the effect of this appreciation had been approximately offset by the depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies. Attempts by the Chinese authorities to stem the rate of exchange rate appreciation against the US dollar had seen foreign exchange reserves rise to US$1.4 trillion. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated further in October, but trading had remained volatile. The exchange rate had reached a new high both against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms. Over the past year, the Australian dollar had increased by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> in effective terms and was higher against all currencies in the basket apart from the Canadian dollar. Members noted that movements in the Australian dollar had recently been highly correlated with general market sentiment towards risk. ", " Conditions in domestic credit markets had improved noticeably in October. As an indication of this, bond issuance had picked up, though mostly by financial institutions. Bond spreads had increased since the onset of the credit market disruption, and were about 20 basis points higher for top-rated borrowers. Issuance of residential-mortgage-backed securities had also increased recently, though the size of issues had fallen and spreads had widened. Bond issuance by corporates had been minor, perhaps indicating that these borrowers were looking to their bankers for funding, which would be consistent with the sharp growth in intermediated business credit in recent months. ", " Since the August cash rate increase, it was estimated that banks' funding costs had risen by an additional 15 basis points. This had been passed on to many business borrowing rates and most low-doc and non-conforming housing loan rates, but not to rates on standard variable mortgages. ", " Demand for exchange settlement funds at the Reserve Bank had declined as credit market conditions had improved, though it was still somewhat higher than the average level of recent years. The Bank was supplying enough to meet that demand, so as to keep the cash rate at the target. ", " In relation to Australian monetary policy, markets had moved immediately following the release of the CPI to fully price in a tightening at this meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was for an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.75 per cent.</span> ", " In considering the recommendation, Board members agreed that on domestic economic grounds, the case for a further tightening of monetary policy was clear. Key data on demand and activity and prices all pointed to the likelihood of stronger medium-term inflationary pressures. According to the latest national accounts, all components of demand, apart from housing investment, were increasing strongly and economic activity had expanded at a pace well above average over the year to June. Available data suggested these trends had continued more recently. The labour market had tightened further and underlying inflation had risen to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent.</span> ", " Members noted that on a year-ended basis, inflation was expected to increase further in the near term. The staff's inflation forecast showed CPI and underlying inflation rising to above <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> by mid next year, and there was a risk of inflation remaining above the target for an extended period. In discussing this outlook, members noted that strong investment was adding to productive capacity and the appreciation of the exchange rate was likely to have a dampening effect on prices. Nonetheless, if the recent pace of demand growth were sustained, there would be further pressure on the economy's productive capacity and the labour market, intensifying inflationary pressures over the medium term. ", " Members took note that parts of the world economy had become weaker in recent months and forecasts for the United States and other major industrial economies had been lowered, partly reflecting the likely effects of the tightening of capital market conditions since August. However, world growth was still expected to be above average in 2008, due to the growing importance of China and other emerging economies. Ongoing rapid growth in China, in particular, was stimulating the Australian economy, with the higher levels of commodity prices and the terms of trade lifting domestic incomes and underpinning strong growth in spending. ", " As in previous months, credit market developments in Australia and overseas were an important element in the Board's deliberations. Members noted that, although confidence in international credit markets remained fragile, market conditions had generally been more settled recently, with risk spreads narrowing from their peaks of a couple of months earlier. The disruptions from the tightening in credit conditions in the United States and other major economies were expected to play out over a protracted period and the extent to which they would moderate economic growth was uncertain. But the tightening of credit conditions in Australia had not been as pronounced as elsewhere and, in any event, local conditions had improved in recent weeks. Although interest costs in wholesale markets were still a little higher than a few months earlier, sound borrowers were still able to obtain finance readily. ", " In weighing all the information available on domestic and overseas economic conditions and developments in financial markets, members judged that, on balance, a further increase in the cash rate was needed to contain inflation to 2–3 per cent in the medium term. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided that the cash rate should be increased by 25 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.75 per cent,</span> effective the following day. "]}},

", " Survey measures of business conditions in both the manufacturing and services sectors had improved since mid 2016 in a range of countries, and global consumer confidence had increased markedly to a high level. Members noted that global consumption growth had remained steady at a solid rate and had underpinned growth in the world economy over recent years. ", " The improvement in global economic conditions had been evident in stronger growth in both merchandise trade and industrial production. Data on new export orders suggested continued strong growth in exports in the near term. Members observed that there had been some signs that this strength was flowing through to business investment, particularly in Japan and the high-income economies in east Asia. Business investment had also picked up recently in the United States. Members also noted that a more broadly based strengthening in business investment would assist in generating a self-sustaining positive dynamic in the world economy. ", " In China, growth in private fixed asset investment had been slowing for some time from very high rates. This reflected structural factors, as growth rebalanced in line with the maturing of the Chinese economy, as well as cyclical factors more recently. Members noted that dwelling investment had picked up over the preceding year or so, partly in response to an easing in housing policies in 2015. The recovery in residential construction had continued despite the Chinese authorities having again tightened policy measures aimed at reducing speculative activity in a number of cities to contain rapid housing price growth. ", " Spending on property construction, as well as infrastructure investment, in China had supported the demand for steel and, in turn, Chinese imports of iron ore and coal. This strength in demand had been reflected in Chinese steel prices, but iron ore prices had declined, as expected, largely reflecting increases in supply. Coal prices had also declined recently, as supply disruptions associated with Cyclone Debbie had been resolved. ", " Globally, headline inflation had picked up over the preceding year, largely reflecting higher oil prices. However, members noted that this inflationary impulse had started to dissipate as oil prices had fallen since the start of the year. Core inflation had generally remained low. ", " Unemployment rates in many major advanced economies had been around or below levels that could be associated with a build-up in wage pressures. Wage growth had been increasing gradually in the United States and Japan, but an increase had not been as apparent in most European countries. Taking into account the low rate of productivity growth generally, growth in unit labour costs had been above average in the United States, Japan and Germany. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic conditions by noting that the March quarter national accounts, which were scheduled for release the day after the Board meeting, were likely to show that GDP growth had moderated following the strong December quarter outcome. Partial indicators had suggested that slower growth in consumption and falls in residential investment and resource exports were likely to be recorded in the accounts. However, nominal output growth was expected to have been supported by the strength in the terms of trade during the quarter. ", " Weak growth in retail sales in the March quarter had pointed to a slowing in consumption growth following strong growth in the December quarter. According to liaison and survey data, retail trading conditions had remained challenging, although they had appeared to have improved a little since the start of the year, and this assessment had been supported by the large rise in retail sales in April. Low household income growth and concerns about increased indebtedness had continued to pose downside risks to the outlook for consumption growth. ", " The labour market was an important factor in the outlook for household income growth. Employment growth had picked up over 2017 and forward-looking indicators of labour demand suggested that the recent pace of employment growth was likely to continue. However, growth had continued to be disproportionate, with part-time jobs and total hours worked having fallen in prior months. Members observed that, although the unemployment rate had fallen to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.7 per cent</span> in April, the number of employed people who would like to work more hours had not declined. ", " Members noted the divergence in labour market developments across the states, although the degree to which this was consistent with other indicators of economic conditions across the states varied. In particular, the steady growth in hours worked in Victoria, in line with the state's strong economic growth, was in contrast to the fall in hours worked over the previous year or so in New South Wales, which had also posted relatively strong economic growth. The pick-up in hours worked in Western Australia and, more recently, Queensland suggested that the drag from the adjustment to the downturn in mining investment in those states might be running or have run its course. ", " Members also discussed conditions in the youth labour market, which historically has been very sensitive to changes in labour market conditions more generally. In particular, members noted that the proportion of 15–19 year olds not in education, training or employment had been declining over recent years, while the proportion of 20–24 year olds not in education, training or employment had been increasing. ", " The wage price index had increased by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter, suggesting that aggregate wage growth had stabilised at low levels. Wage growth had remained particularly low in the mining sector. Liaison suggested that, while wage growth is likely to remain subdued for some time yet, there had been isolated reports of localised and skills-specific labour shortages feeding into higher wages. ", " Work done on residential construction had posted an unexpected fall in the March quarter. Members noted that this was partly explained by wet weather in some states during this period, suggesting some recovery could be expected in the June quarter. In contrast, there had been further falls in construction in Western Australia, which was consistent with the persistently weak conditions in that state's construction sector. The outstanding pipeline of work had remained high in most other states and was expected to support residential building activity over the forecast period. However, building approvals had fallen across most states since late 2016, particularly for higher-density dwellings, and the pipeline of work to be done was likely to decline over the forecast period. ", " Conditions in the established housing market had continued to vary across the country. Conditions remained strong in Sydney and Melbourne, although there had been some tentative signs of easing; housing price growth and auction clearance rates in both cities had declined. In contrast, housing market conditions had been weaker elsewhere for some time, particularly in Perth and in the Brisbane apartment market, where housing prices had been declining. ", " Housing credit growth overall had been relatively steady in recent months. Some slowing in the growth of credit to investors in housing had been apparent, which was consistent with the reduction in loan approvals to investors. This had been associated with the increases in interest rates on these loans and in interest-only loans more broadly. Members noted that it would take some time for the full effects of the latest prudential supervision measures introduced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to flow through to the housing lending data. ", " The ABS survey of capital expenditure suggested that mining investment had increased slightly in the March quarter, in contrast to the forecast by the Bank of a further decline at the time of the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. In line with the Bank's forecasts, however, the capital expenditure survey continued to suggest further falls in investment in the mining sector over the coming year or so, but at a declining rate. Growth in non-mining investment was also expected to have increased in the March quarter, mainly due to an increase in non-residential construction. ", " The capital expenditure survey continued to imply subdued growth in non-mining investment for the next year or so. However, members noted that this survey covers only around half of non-mining investment and excludes investment in areas such as health and education, and in intangible assets, such as software, for which investment growth had been strongest in recent years. Furthermore, monthly building approvals for non-residential construction had picked up a little in recent months and reports from liaison had identified a range of commercial property projects that are under consideration for the year ahead. Members also noted that survey measures of business conditions had risen further, to be around their levels before the financial crisis. However, surveys suggested that conditions in the retail sector remained difficult, despite a recent improvement, consistent with reports of heightened competition in that sector. ", " The Australian Government Budget had reported little change to the expected cash deficits over the next few years and, as a result, had had little effect on the Bank's near-term outlook for the Australian economy. Some new large infrastructure projects had been announced as a part of the Budget, but most of that spending would occur after 2019. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members observed that financial markets had remained relatively quiet over prior months and political developments had continued to be a key focus of market participants over the preceding month. Financial conditions had generally remained very accommodative, with the exception of China, where the authorities had acted to reduce leverage in the financial system. ", " Long-term government bond yields in the United States had declined a little over the preceding month, to be at the lower end of the range experienced since the US election, as uncertainty remained about the near-term implementation of the administration's policy agenda. Long-term bond yields in other major markets had been little changed over the preceding month. In Australia, yields on long-term government bonds had declined a little over the preceding month and the spread to US Treasury bond yields had remained at low levels. ", " Members noted that estimates of the term premium in the United States had been at historically low levels for most of the preceding six years, including some negative estimates at times. The low level of the term premium implied that market participants were generally not concerned about the prospect of a sharp rise in either inflation or real interest rates, and/or that compensation for these risks was low for other reasons, including possibly the lack of suitable alternatives for a number of market participants to investing in long-term US government securities. ", " The major central banks had left policy settings and the nature of their policy guidance largely unchanged since the previous meeting. The minutes of the previous US Federal Open Market Committee meeting had highlighted that the Federal Reserve was likely to begin shrinking its balance sheet gradually later in 2017. The European Central Bank had earlier slowed its rate of asset purchases and was expected to reduce it further in 2018. The Bank of Japan was expected to continue with its asset purchase program. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had been little changed on a trade-weighted basis over the preceding month and was around its level immediately before the US election. The euro had appreciated a little further since the previous meeting, in response to an easing of political risks following election outcomes and generally positive economic developments. The Australian dollar had depreciated a little over the preceding month on a trade-weighted basis, consistent with the decline in commodity prices. ", " After several years of depreciation in the renminbi against the US dollar and net private capital outflows from China, the exchange rate of the renminbi against the US dollar had stabilised since the end of 2016, although it had appreciated a little very recently. At the same time, net capital outflows had declined markedly as the authorities had increased their scrutiny over capital flows. Members noted that the People's Bank of China had recently adjusted the daily fixing mechanism for the exchange rate. ", " Members noted that global financing conditions had remained generally favourable, with corporate bond yields having declined in most major economies and emerging markets, as well as in Australia, over the preceding month. ", " In contrast to developments elsewhere, in China sovereign and corporate bond yields had risen further in response to measures aimed at reducing leverage in the financial system and improving the transparency of investment products. One consequence of these actions had been reduced demand for corporate bonds and hence issuance of these bonds had declined noticeably. Members observed that household credit growth in China had continued to rise. ", " Major share markets had been increasing over 2017 to date, but banks' share prices had generally declined over prior months. In the United States, these falls had reflected the market's changing expectations about implementation of the US administration's policy agenda and, in Japan, bank share prices had declined following lower-than-expected corporate earnings. ", " Australian share prices had declined over the preceding month, to return to around their levels at the end of 2016. The decline had been driven by a sizeable fall in bank share prices. Members noted that some part of this reflected the fall in bank share prices in global markets, but that there had also been a range of domestic factors contributing to the fall, including somewhat mixed bank profit results relative to expectations and the announcement of a major bank levy in the Australian Government Budget. In the days following Standard &amp; Poor's announcement lowering the ratings of a number of smaller Australian financial institutions, equity prices of these institutions generally fell relative to those that had not been downgraded. Members noted that the magnitude of the major bank levy was not particularly large compared with typical market movements in bank funding costs. They also noted that there was likely to be some effect of the rating downgrade on the cost of wholesale funding for smaller financial institutions, but these institutions accessed less wholesale funding than the major banks. More broadly, bank funding costs were estimated to have declined a little further in recent months. ", " Financial market pricing continued to indicate an expectation that the cash rate would remain unchanged over the remainder of 2017. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members discussed how financial stability considerations bear on monetary policy decisions, reviewing both the academic literature and policy experience in a number of countries, including Sweden and the United States. ", " The Bank has responsibility for promoting financial stability within its flexible medium-term inflation targeting framework. Over recent times, with interest rates at low levels, the Board has set monetary policy to support the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom, while also paying close attention to trends in household borrowing and related financial stability considerations. Members discussed the effect of monetary policy decisions on financial stability and on future inflation, employment and output. They also discussed the role that prudential supervision can play in promoting financial stability. In view of this, members acknowledged the importance of a strong relationship between the Bank and other regulators, particularly APRA. They observed that the current positive culture of cooperation across the relevant agencies in Australia has been of considerable value to good policy outcomes in recent years and it is therefore important that it be maintained. The strong relationship among regulators is facilitated by the Council of Financial Regulators, which is the coordinating body for the main financial regulatory agencies to promote the stability of the Australian financial system, as well as contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of financial regulation. ", " Turning to the immediate decision regarding the level of the cash rate, members noted that the broad-based pick-up in the world economy was continuing. Labour markets had tightened further in many countries and this was expected to lead to a pick-up in wages and prices over time. Headline inflation rates in most countries had moved higher over the past year, partly reflecting higher commodity prices. Nonetheless, core inflation had remained low. ", " Domestically, members' assessment was that the transition to lower levels of mining investment following the mining investment boom was almost complete. Surveyed business conditions had improved and business investment had picked up in those parts of the economy not directly affected by the decline in mining investment. Although year-ended GDP growth was expected to have slowed in the March quarter, reflecting the quarter-to-quarter variation in the figures, members noted that economic growth was still expected to increase gradually over the next couple of years to a little above 3 per cent per annum. ", " Members noted that, although employment growth had been stronger in recent months, growth in total hours worked had declined. Nevertheless, the various forward-looking indicators pointed to continued growth in employment over the period ahead and a gradual erosion of the spare capacity in the labour market. Wage growth had remained low and this was likely to remain the case for some time yet. However, wage growth and inflation were expected to increase gradually as the economy strengthened. Members observed that low growth in incomes, along with high levels of household debt, appeared to have been restraining growth in household consumption. ", " The economic outlook continued to be supported by the low level of interest rates. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment. ", " Conditions in the housing market had continued to vary considerably around the country. Housing prices had been rising briskly in some markets, although there had been some signs that price pressures were starting to ease. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Growth in housing debt had outpaced the slow growth in household incomes. APRA's recent prudential supervision measures should help address the risks associated with high and rising levels of indebtedness. In response to those measures, increases in mortgage rates, particularly for investors and interest-only loans, had been announced, but were yet to have their full effect. ", " The Board continued to judge that developments in the labour and housing markets warranted careful monitoring. Taking into account all the available information, including that year-ended growth in output was expected to have slowed in the March quarter, the Board judged that holding the accommodative stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

GDP growth remained below Bank estimates of potential output growth, consistent with spare capacity in the labour market and low inflation. New South Wales and Victoria had continued to make the largest contributions to year-ended growth in domestic demand. Although domestic demand had declined again in Western Australia, there were some signs of improvement in that state. Quarterly growth was expected to have increased in the June quarter despite the disruptions to coal export volumes following Cyclone Debbie. ", "Growth in household consumption had slowed in the March quarter in line with subdued household income growth. More timely indicators suggested that household spending had strengthened in the June quarter. The value of retail sales had increased in April, consistent with liaison reports that suggested conditions in the retail sector had improved. Members noted that the recent pick-up in growth in employment should also support a pick-up in household income growth, and therefore consumption growth, in the period ahead. ", "Members discussed the decline in dwelling investment in the March quarter, noting that it had been concentrated in Queensland and in New South Wales, where activity had been affected by wet weather. While the flow of new project approvals had been noticeably lower in prior months, the large pipeline of projects was expected to support building activity at a high level over the subsequent year or so. ", "Conditions in established housing markets and for new construction had continued to vary significantly across the country and between dwelling types. Sydney and Melbourne remained the strongest markets, consistent with relatively high population growth. Members observed that population growth had been particularly high in Victoria, because of high migration from overseas and interstate. In contrast, Western Australia had experienced a sharp decline in population growth following the end of the mining investment boom. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had softened recently, suggesting that conditions in these markets had eased somewhat. Housing prices in Perth and apartment prices in Brisbane had fallen further. Members noted that there had been several periods in the preceding decade in which housing prices had fallen, or growth had slowed significantly, in different parts of the country. ", "Private business investment had increased in the March quarter, driven by an unexpected increase in mining investment. Non-mining investment had declined a little in the quarter, but had been gradually trending up for a number of years. Over the previous five years, most of the growth in business investment had occurred in Victoria and New South Wales. Survey measures of current business conditions had generally remained well above average and profits of the private non-financial sector had risen again in the March quarter, to be 30 per cent higher over the prior year. Most of the increase had been accounted for by the mining sector, but other industries had also recorded higher profits. ", "Public demand had increased modestly in the March quarter. The most recent Australian and state government budgets suggested that fiscal policy would be more expansionary in 2017/18 than had previously been expected. Some of this expansion was expected to come from more spending on public infrastructure, particularly in New South Wales. Reflecting this, work yet to be done on public infrastructure had increased in recent quarters to a relatively high share of GDP. Members noted that infrastructure investment was expected to have significant positive spillovers to other parts of the economy. Non-residential building approvals had also risen in recent months. ", "The terms of trade had increased again in the March quarter, to be nearly 25 per cent higher over the prior year, but were expected to have declined in the June quarter. A temporary decline in the volume of resource exports in the March quarter had been offset to some extent by ongoing strength in service exports and a pick-up in grain exports as a result of strong winter crop production. The trade balance was recorded as having been in surplus for the second consecutive quarter. Coal export volumes were expected to have fallen in the June quarter as a result of Cyclone Debbie, while iron ore and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes were expected to have increased. ", "Recent data had provided further confirmation that labour market conditions had improved since late 2016, consistent with signals from forward-looking indicators in previous months. Employment growth had been strong in May for the third consecutive month. Members noted that growth in the preceding few months had been driven entirely by full-time employment and that total hours worked had trended higher as a result. The unemployment rate had declined by 0.3 percentage points over the previous two months, to be at its lowest rate since early 2013. However, the underemployment rate, which measures the number of part-time workers wanting to work more hours, had remained elevated. ", "Over the preceding five years or so, the household services sector had contributed the most to increases in full-time and part-time employment. Full-time employment had also increased significantly in business services over this period, but had fallen in the goods-related sector. Employment growth had remained highest in Victoria over the year and had started to pick up in New South Wales in recent months, following soft conditions over the prior year. Labour market conditions in Western Australia and Queensland appeared to have improved. ", "Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, such as job advertisements and business hiring intentions, had remained positive and generally consistent with the patterns of employment across states and industries. ", "Wage measures in the March quarter national accounts had continued to suggest that labour cost pressures remained subdued. The Fair Work Commission had announced a 3.3 per cent increase in award wages and the national minimum wage, effective from 1 July 2017. This followed an increase of 2.4 per cent in 2016 and was likely to affect the wages of around two-fifths of workers. ", "Members noted that wholesale electricity prices had risen sharply over the first half of 2017 and that this had led to significant increases in prices for retail customers. Members discussed these increases in the context of efforts to address climate change and to alter Australia's energy mix. Concerns about energy security, reliability and costs had been heightened over the preceding six months or so, partly reflecting policy uncertainty and its effect on the investment decisions of electricity generators. Members also discussed how developments in the LNG sector had affected the costs and decisions of electricity generators. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members observed that the improvement in the world economy was continuing and that output growth in some economies in the March quarter had been a little stronger than expected. Merchandise trade and industrial production had increased further in the preceding months. Higher trade volumes had spurred investment and supported growth, particularly in Japan and other high-income economies in east Asia. Members noted that the ongoing growth in business investment in the major advanced economies and east Asia was a positive sign for the sustainability of global growth in the period ahead. Labour markets in the major advanced economies had continued to strengthen, which was also a positive development for more sustained global growth. ", "Core inflation had remained low and headline inflation had turned down in a number of economies, as the effect of higher energy prices in 2016 had dissipated. Members noted that non-OPEC countries had increased oil production, placing downward pressure on oil prices and headline inflation. ", "The pace of growth in the Chinese economy had been maintained in prior months, assisted by the accommodative stance of policy. Growth in investment had been stable, as a solid rise in private investment growth had more than offset a slowing in public investment growth. Consistent with this, Chinese demand for commodities had been resilient. Imports of iron ore had increased since late 2016 and coal imports had stabilised at a relatively high level. Chinese domestic production had increased following a relaxation of policies to restrict output. Members noted that growth in business financing had been stable over 2017 to date, as higher growth in business loans had offset a moderation in the growth of securities financing. ", "The slowdown in GDP growth in the United States in the March quarter appeared to have been temporary. Consumption growth had picked up in recent months and investment intentions had remained high. The unemployment rate had declined further in May and was below most estimates of full employment. Members noted that wage and unit labour cost growth had increased over the previous two years. ", "In the euro area, robust growth in retail sales and very high levels of consumer confidence suggested that consumption growth had picked up in the June quarter. Conditions had been supportive of a pick-up in investment and surveys had suggested that firms intend to increase investment accordingly. Increased business confidence had translated into more demand for labour; employment growth had strengthened and had been reasonably broadly based, while the unemployment rate for the euro area had declined to its lowest level since 2009. However, wage growth had remained subdued. ", "The Japanese labour market had also continued to improve, with strong growth in employment and a large increase in participation by the 65+ age cohort and women. Although total average wage growth had remained subdued in Japan, wage growth for part-time workers had increased. "], "Financial Markets": ["Members noted that financial markets had generally experienced low volatility over preceding months. The implications of statements by central banks in the major economies for the future path of monetary policy had been a focus for financial market participants more recently. ", "In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had increased its target for the US federal funds rate by 25 basis points in June, as had been widely expected. The FOMC had also outlined some details regarding the plan for a gradual and predictable reduction in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, which is expected to begin later this year. Members noted that financial market participants continued to expect further increases in the US federal funds rate to occur more slowly than implied by the median projections of FOMC members. ", "Following its meeting in June, the European Central Bank had removed the easing bias from its forward guidance on interest rates, on the basis of a more positive economic outlook. In response, financial market prices had shifted to suggest that a small increase in the euro area policy rate was expected by the end of 2018. Also, the market-implied probability of near-term policy rate increases in Canada and the United Kingdom had increased in the preceding month in response to statements by senior central bank officials in those economies. ", "Long-term government bond yields in most of the major financial markets had increased over the preceding month in response to changing expectations about monetary policy. Members noted that yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds had remained close to the Bank of Japan's target of around 0 per cent under its yield curve control policy. Yields on long-term Australian government bonds had increased a little over June, as had their spread to US Treasury bond yields, although both remained at low levels. ", "Most foreign exchange rates were little changed over the preceding month. On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar had remained around its level immediately prior to the US election, having depreciated over the first half of 2017. The euro had appreciated a little further over the preceding month in trade-weighted terms. The Australian dollar had appreciated somewhat since the previous meeting, consistent with slightly better-than-expected domestic economic news, but had remained in the narrow range of the prior year or so in both US dollar and trade-weighted terms. ", "Share prices in the advanced economies, including Australia, had been little changed over June. Members observed that Australian share prices had underperformed relative to those in other developed markets over preceding months, largely reflecting a substantial decline in bank share prices. There had been a small partial retracement of this decline in June. ", "Financial market conditions had remained favourable in most emerging markets, with the decline in government bond yields and the increase in equity prices since early 2017 having continued over the preceding month. ", "In China, financial market conditions had been tightened during 2017 as the authorities worked towards reducing leverage in the financial system. The renminbi exchange rate had been relatively stable in the first half of the year, following a depreciation over the preceding few years. The stock of foreign currency reserves had also remained steady at around US$3 trillion, after a period of persistent declines. ", "Members discussed trends in the composition and cost of Australian banks’ funding. Deposits, which are generally a relatively low-cost form of funding, had increased as a share of funding over recent years, to around 60 per cent, while the share of debt funding, particularly at short maturities, had declined. The cost of both types of funding had declined further since late 2016. Members noted that, over the same period, banks’ lending rates had increased slightly, driven by increases in housing lending rates for investors and on interest-only loans. As a result, the implied spread between the estimated average outstanding lending and funding rates for banks was estimated to have increased slightly. ", "Members observed that housing credit growth overall had been steady during the first part of 2017, with slower growth in lending to investors largely offset by a pick-up in the growth of lending to owner-occupiers. ", "Financial market pricing continued to suggest that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the remainder of 2017, but had shifted to indicate some probability of an increase in the cash rate by mid 2018. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["Members discussed the neutral real interest rate and its decline over the preceding decade. The neutral real interest rate is the interest rate at which output growth is at potential and inflation is stable. Members noted that it is not possible to measure the neutral real interest rate directly, but that it can be inferred from the behaviour of other variables. ", "Members discussed the Bank's work estimating the neutral real interest rate for Australia. The various estimates suggested that the rate had been broadly stable until around 2007, but had since fallen by around 150 basis points to around 1 per cent. This equated to a neutral nominal cash rate of around 3½ per cent, given that medium-term inflation expectations were well anchored around 2½ per cent, although there is significant uncertainty around this estimate. Members noted that some of this decline could be attributed to lower potential output growth, but the increase in risk aversion around the time of the global financial crisis was likely to have been a more important factor, given that the bulk of the decline in the estimated neutral real interest rate had occurred around that time. Estimates of neutral real interest rates for other economies had shown a similar decline. All estimates of the neutral real interest rate for Australia suggested that monetary policy had been clearly expansionary for the preceding five years or so. It was also noted that a reduction in risk aversion and/or an increase in the potential growth rate could see the neutral real interest rate rise again. ", "Turning to the immediate decision regarding the level of the cash rate, members noted that the broad-based recovery in the global economy had continued. There had been further signs that investment was increasing and labour markets had tightened further in many advanced economies. This was expected to lead to a pick-up in growth in wages and prices over time. In this context, members noted that a number of central banks had become more positive about domestic economic conditions, and financial market pricing suggested that there had been upward revisions to the expected path of future monetary policy in these economies. ", "Domestically, the data available for the June quarter had generally been positive, following the slower growth recorded for the March quarter. Although recent indicators suggested that consumption growth had increased in the June quarter, members noted that there were still risks to consumption growth should household income growth remain subdued, particularly given the high levels of household debt. Against this background, the recent improvement in labour market data had been a positive development. Members noted that the strength of recent labour market data had removed some of the downside risk in the Bank's forecast of wage growth. ", "Business surveys had continued to suggest that business conditions were above average. Recent state budgets and data on non-residential construction suggested that the contribution to growth from infrastructure investment would rise. The pipeline of residential construction was expected to support dwelling investment over the forecast period. The economic outlook continued to be supported by the low level of interest rates. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment. ", "Conditions in established housing markets had continued to vary considerably across the country. Members recognised that it was too early for the prudential supervision measures announced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, which were designed to help address the risks associated with high and rising levels of indebtedness, to have had their full effect. ", "Members regarded the improvement in the world economy over the preceding months as a welcome development. Nevertheless, they assessed that current economic conditions in Australia, and the outlook for growth and inflation, meant that developments in the labour and housing markets continued to warrant careful monitoring. Taking into account all the available information, the Board judged that holding the accommodative stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Underlying inflation was ½ per cent in the June quarter and headline inflation was only slightly lower. Both Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation and measures of underlying inflation were running at a little under 2 per cent  in year-ended terms. ", " Non-tradables inflation had reached its highest year-ended rate in two years in the June quarter, boosted by rises in tobacco excise and utilities prices. Market services inflation had increased since 2016, but remained low; around half of total costs in the market services sector are labour costs, and these had been subdued over recent years. Inflation in the costs of constructing a new dwelling had also increased over the prior year in all capital cities other than Perth and Adelaide. In contrast, rents had been increasing at a below-average pace in Sydney and Melbourne, had been falling in Perth and had been broadly stable in most other capital cities.  ", " The prices of tradable consumer durable items had declined over the year, partly reflecting the appreciation of the exchange rate and heightened competition from foreign retailers. Inflation in food prices (excluding fruit and vegetables) had been running at low rates for several years. Supply disruptions from Cyclone Debbie had had relatively little net effect on fruit and vegetables prices in the June quarter. Fuel prices had fallen in the quarter, but had contributed 0.2 percentage points to headline inflation over the year.  ", " Members noted that the Australian Bureau of Statistics intends to update the weights in the CPI in the December quarter 2017 CPI release, to reflect changes in consumers' spending behaviour over recent years. This was expected to lead to lower reported CPI inflation because the weights of items whose prices had fallen were likely to be higher, whereas the weights of items whose prices had risen were likely to be lower. ", " In their discussion of the outlook for the domestic economy, members noted that the Bank's forecasts for output growth and inflation were largely unchanged from three months earlier. They noted that the forecasts were conditioned on the assumption of no change in the Australian dollar exchange rate during the forecast period, which extends to the end of 2019, and that this assumption was one source of uncertainty.  ", " The available data on activity suggested that GDP growth had increased in the June quarter, following weaker-than-expected growth in the March quarter. Output growth was expected to reach around 3 per cent in year-ended terms during 2018 and 2019, which was a little higher than estimates of potential growth. The recent data had indicated that consumption growth had increased in the June quarter. The value of retail sales had risen strongly in April and May, and the increases had been broadly based both nationally and across spending categories. Beyond the June quarter, rising employment and stronger household income growth were expected to support consumption growth, which was forecast to be a little above its average of recent years. ", " Dwelling investment was expected to recover from the weakness in the March quarter, which was partly the result of wet weather in New South Wales, and remain at a high level over the following year or so, sustained by the large pipeline of residential building work already approved or under way. The number of new residential building approvals had stepped down since 2016 and members noted that, if approvals remained at current levels, construction activity could also begin to decline.  ", " The established housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had remained the strongest in the country, although conditions had eased since late 2016. Housing prices in Perth had declined a little further, while apartment price growth in Brisbane had been weak. ", " Turning to the business sector, members noted that activity in the mining sector was expected to be supported in the June quarter by stronger resource export volumes. Coking coal exports had returned to pre-cyclone levels in May, and liquefied natural gas exports had continued to increase. The decline in mining investment was expected to run its course in the following year or so and thereafter no longer be a drag on growth. Resource exports were expected to make a significant contribution to GDP growth over the forecast period. ", " Investment by non-mining businesses was expected to pick up later in the forecast period in response to stronger growth in demand. Businesses had continued to report above-average business conditions and members noted that many of the conditions that might typically be associated with stronger growth in investment were in place. Some indicators of non-mining investment, including recent strength in sales of commercial motor vehicles and the higher investment intentions recorded in the NAB survey, had been more positive in the period leading up to the meeting. The increase in the level of non-residential building approvals had also signalled a more positive outlook for private non-residential construction, although the pipeline of work to be done was at low levels. The pipeline of public infrastructure activity had increased over the previous few years, to be at its highest share of GDP since the mid 1980s. The expected increase in expenditure on public infrastructure had been reported as flowing into the order books of firms in the private sector. ", " Members observed that recent data had suggested further improvement in the labour market. Employment had increased in every state since the start of 2017, including solid growth in the mining-exposed states. This provided further evidence that the drag on economic activity from earlier declines in the terms of trade and falling mining investment were running their course. Over this period, around 165,000 full-time jobs had been created, labour force participation had risen and average hours worked had increased.  ", " The unemployment rate had been little changed in June at 5.6 per cent and underemployment had edged lower over prior months. Indicators of labour demand had pointed to further employment growth and little change in the unemployment rate over coming quarters. By the end of the forecast period, the unemployment rate was expected to be just below 5½ per cent, slightly lower than forecast in May but still implying a degree of spare capacity in the labour market. Members observed that the recent improvement in labour market conditions and the increase in award wages should help support household incomes and thus spending. Some upside risk to spending could be envisaged if employment were to be higher than forecast. On the other hand, expectations of ongoing low wage growth could weigh on consumption growth. Spending could also be constrained by elevated levels of household debt, especially if housing market conditions were to weaken. ", " More broadly, members noted there was some uncertainty about the effect any decline in spare capacity in the labour market would have on wage and price inflation. Information from liaison indicated that some employers were finding it harder to attract workers with particular skills. If this were to broaden, wage growth could increase more quickly than forecast, which would see inflationary pressures also emerge more quickly. However, wage and price inflation had not increased by as much as expected in other economies around the world that are already close to full employment, which raised the possibility that low inflation in Australia might also persist longer than forecast.  ", " Turning to the inflation forecast, members noted that underlying inflation was expected to be close to 2 per cent in the second half of 2017 and to edge higher over the subsequent two years. Most of the difference between headline and underlying inflation over the forecast period could be accounted for by further increases in tobacco excise and utilities prices. Retail electricity prices were expected to increase sharply in the September quarter, following the increases in retail prices in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia on 1 July, and the March quarter 2018, when similar increases were expected in Victoria. Members acknowledged that the second-round effects of higher utilities prices on retail prices through business costs were uncertain, partly because it was unclear when utilities contracts for businesses would be subject to renewal. Members also observed that energy is a relatively low share of costs for most businesses, although it is higher for some businesses that compete in international markets.  ", " The inflation forecast partly reflected an expectation of a modest increase in wage growth as labour market conditions tightened further and the drag on activity and incomes from falls in mining investment and the terms of trade diminished. Working in the opposite direction were the effects of additional competition in the retail industry, the dampening effect of expanding housing supply on growth in rents, and the recent exchange rate appreciation. Headline inflation had been revised a little higher in the updated forecasts, mostly reflecting the prospect of faster growth in utilities prices, and was expected to be between 2 and 3 per cent over much of the forecast period. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that economic conditions had strengthened over the prior year and the improvement had broadened beyond international trade. In particular, growth in business investment had picked up in several advanced and emerging economies, including the United States, Canada, Japan and a number of economies in east Asia. Consumption growth had been resilient. Recent GDP data had generally confirmed earlier expectations and, accordingly, the forecast for global growth had been little changed since that published in the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. A gradual increase in global inflationary pressures over the subsequent couple of years had seemed likely, as spare capacity in many advanced economies was expected to be absorbed, resulting in higher wage growth. However, as members noted, even though labour market conditions had already tightened in some advanced economies, wage growth and core inflation had remained subdued.", " Growth in GDP in China had been a little stronger than expected in the June quarter, supported by accommodative financial conditions and expansionary fiscal policy. The strengthening in conditions in the industrial sector over recent months had been broadly based; construction activity had been resilient, although housing market policies introduced in some cities over the preceding year had been effective in lowering overall housing price inflation. Demand for both consumer goods and Chinese exports had picked up. The strength in manufacturing and construction activity had contributed to higher demand for steel. As a result, imports of iron ore, including from Australia, had trended higher and prices for iron ore and coking coal had increased since the previous meeting. The outlook for Australia's thermal coal exports had not benefited to the same extent, partly because there had been an increase in domestic Chinese production. The forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised up a little since May, but still implied a decline from their recent peak.", " Growth in China was expected to ease in 2018 and 2019 because of structural factors such as a declining working-age population, as well as policies to address financial risks. Members noted that the outlook for the Chinese economy remained a significant source of uncertainty. In particular, it was unclear how the authorities would negotiate the difficult trade-off between growth and the build-up of leverage in the Chinese economy. To address risks in the shadow banking sector, the authorities had recently sought to improve coordination among financial regulators and had announced tighter regulatory measures. Members noted that such measures could be difficult to calibrate and that, as a result, financial conditions might tighten by more than expected.", " GDP growth in the rest of east Asia looked to have been around estimates of potential in the first half of 2017, supported by accommodative policies as well as the increase in global trade growth. Members noted that many economies in this region were deeply integrated into global supply chains, particularly for semiconductors and other electronics. There had also been signs of a recovery in retail sales and a sharp increase in consumer confidence in South Korea, the largest economy in the region. ", " In the three largest advanced economies, investment growth had picked up and employment growth had supported growth in household incomes and consumption. GDP growth had picked up in the June quarter in the United States and had been above potential rates for some time in the euro area and Japan, which had experienced sizeable increases in exports as global economic conditions had improved. GDP growth in all three major advanced economies was expected to remain above estimates of potential growth over the forecast period. Unemployment rates had declined to low levels in all three economies and in the United States and Japan were below levels associated with full employment. "], "Financial Markets": ["Members noted that over recent months most attention in international financial markets had been on changes in expectations regarding monetary policy. In a number of advanced economies, monetary policy was expected to be somewhat less accommodative than previously anticipated.", "At its June meeting, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased its policy rate and outlined plans for a gradual and predictable reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. More recently, the FOMC had indicated that the balance sheet reduction would be likely to begin relatively soon. Financial market participants continued to expect further increases in the US federal funds rate to occur more slowly than implied by the median projections of FOMC participants. At its July meeting, the European Central Bank had emphasised that monetary policy needed to remain very accommodative, but had also indicated that it will consider whether to reduce the pace of asset purchases at one of its forthcoming meetings. In July, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate for the first time in seven years and financial market participants expected further increases. Central banks in several other advanced economies had also adjusted their communication over recent months so as to remove earlier biases towards easier monetary policy.", "Long-term government bond yields had responded to the changes in expectations for the stance of monetary policy, with yields in most major financial markets, as well as in Australia, having risen from their levels in early June. Members noted, however, that yields remained at low levels. In Japan, yields on 10-year government bonds had remained around zero during 2017, consistent with the Bank of Japan's policy of yield curve control.", "Members observed that financial market conditions remained very favourable. Corporate financing conditions had continued to improve, with the increase in equity prices and decline in corporate bond spreads having continued over 2017 in the United States and the euro area.", "In China, financial market conditions also remained accommodative, but had tightened since the end of 2016 as the authorities had instituted a range of measures to reduce leverage in financial markets. Bond yields had increased markedly since late 2016, despite a slight retracement in recent months, and corporate bond issuance had slowed following strong growth over the preceding several years. Members observed that credit availability to households and businesses had been relatively unaffected by the regulatory measures. The renminbi exchange rate had appreciated against the US dollar since the beginning of 2017, but had depreciated in trade-weighted terms. The Chinese authorities had increased their scrutiny of capital flows, resulting in a decline in net capital outflows, and the value of the People's Bank of China's foreign currency reserves had stabilised.", " Members noted that there had been a broadly based depreciation of the US dollar over 2017, including against the Australian dollar. The appreciation of the Australian dollar over the previous two months had resulted in it returning to 2015 levels in US dollar terms and to the levels of late 2014 on a trade-weighted basis.", " In Australia, housing credit growth had been steady over the first half of 2017, as a decline in growth in housing credit extended to investors had been offset by a slight increase in growth in housing credit to owner-occupiers. Members discussed the relative increases in housing lending rates to investors compared with owner-occupiers and for interest-only loans compared with principal-and-interest loans. Overall, the average actual interest rate paid on all outstanding housing loans was estimated to have increased slightly since late 2016. Housing loan approvals to investors had declined in recent months, which pointed to some easing in growth in housing credit to investors. The share of interest-only housing loans in total loan approvals appeared to have declined noticeably in the June quarter in response to recent measures introduced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to improve lending standards. Moreover, there was evidence of some switching of existing interest-only loans to principal-and-interest loans.", " Australian share prices had been broadly steady in recent months. Over July, bank share prices had retraced some of their earlier decline, in line with a rise in bank share prices globally and following APRA's announcement of additional capital requirements for the banking sector, which were only slightly higher than banks' current actual capital ratios. The major banks had been issuing increasingly longer-dated bonds, including two large US-denominated 30-year bond issues in July. Members noted that longer-dated bonds are favoured under the Net Stable Funding Ratio requirement, which will come into effect in 2018. Members also noted that Australian issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities had continued at the relatively strong pace seen since late 2016.", " Financial market pricing had continued to suggest that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the remainder of 2017, with some expectation of an increase in the cash rate by mid 2018. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the improvement in global economic conditions had continued, particularly in China and the euro area. Demand growth from the Chinese industrial sector had been stronger than expected and had contributed to higher commodity prices. Labour markets had continued to tighten in a number of economies, but inflation had generally remained subdued. There had been a broadly based depreciation of the US dollar. Consistent with that, a number of currencies were close to their highs of the previous few years against the US dollar, including the euro and the Canadian dollar. The Australian dollar also had risen to levels last seen in 2015.", " Domestically, the outlook was little changed. The forecast was for GDP growth to increase to around 3 per cent during the forecast period, supported by the low level of interest rates. Business conditions had improved further and faster growth in non-mining business investment was expected. Inflation was still expected to increase gradually as the economy strengthened. However, a further appreciation of the exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in inflation and economic activity than currently forecast.", " Employment growth had been stronger over recent months, so the forecasts for the labour market were starting from a stronger position. Forward-looking indicators suggested that the degree of spare capacity in the labour market would continue to decline gradually. Wage growth had remained low but was still expected to increase a little as conditions in the labour market improved. Members observed that recent strong employment growth would be likely to contribute to an increase in household disposable income, and therefore consumption growth, over the forecast period. However, ongoing low wage growth and the high level of debt on household balance sheets raised the possibility that consumption growth could be lower than forecast.", " Members regarded conditions in the housing market and household balance sheets as continuing to warrant careful monitoring. Conditions in the housing market varied considerably around the country. While there were signs that conditions in the Sydney and Melbourne markets had eased somewhat, housing price growth in these two cities had remained relatively strong. In some other housing markets, prices had been declining. Borrowers investing in residential property had been facing higher interest rates and growth in credit to investors had eased, but overall housing credit growth had continued to outpace the relatively slow growth in household incomes.", " Taking account of the available information and the need to balance the risks associated with high household debt in a low-inflation environment, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Employment had risen further in July, the participation rate had edged higher and the unemployment rate had remained steady at 5.6 per cent. Full-time employment had risen strongly over the preceding year (even though it had declined in July) and had outpaced the growth in part-time employment over that period. Members noted that the improvement in the labour market since late 2016 had been broadly based across the states. Forward indicators suggested that the improvement in labour market conditions was likely to continue. Members discussed current influences on the participation rate, noting in particular the rise in participation by older female workers as they delayed their retirement. ", " While unemployment rates in Queensland and Western Australia had remained high relative to earlier periods, employment growth in those states had risen, suggesting that the labour market adjustment to the earlier decline in the terms of trade and falling mining investment was progressing. In the context of a broader discussion of economic developments in Queensland, members observed that economic conditions in the state had generally strengthened over recent quarters, reflecting continued growth in consumption and, increasingly, a pick-up in business investment and public demand. Strength in tourism and other service industries had supported growth in aggregate demand in Queensland. In contrast, population growth had been below average, reflecting lower net overseas and interstate migration. ", "Members discussed the broad trends in activity by industry across the eastern states over the preceding decade or so. The cycle in mining activity and commodity prices, the spillover to related industries and the sustained strength in construction had dominated developments in Queensland. Members noted the increasing contribution to growth from the education and training sectors, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, which had been supported by demand from overseas. The trend decline in manufacturing was evident across all states on the eastern seaboard. ", "The wage price index data for the June quarter confirmed that wage growth had remained stable at a low rate. Other data showed that wage increases in new enterprise bargaining agreements had remained below the average of current agreements. Members noted that these data were consistent with the Bank's forecast for growth in wages to remain low for some time, before picking up gradually in response to the strengthening labour market. The pattern of growth in wages across industries had broadly mirrored the pattern of employment growth, with higher outcomes in the healthcare and education sectors and lower wage increases in the mining and retail sectors. ", "Members were briefed on developments in the housing market. For Australia as a whole, after population growth had outpaced growth in the number of dwellings for much of the decade from the mid 2000s, the converse had been true in recent years. Although dwelling investment remained at a high level, members noted that building approvals had stepped down and the pipeline of residential construction work appeared to have passed its peak. In Western Australia, dwelling investment had declined significantly, while in Queensland it had declined from very high levels and the stock of work in the pipeline was being worked down gradually. Although a further substantial increase in dwelling investment was not expected, the large amount of work remaining in the pipeline in New South Wales and Victoria suggested that dwelling investment was likely to stay at a high level in the subsequent couple of years. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable number of new apartments was scheduled to be completed in the period ahead. ", "In the established housing market, a number of indicators suggested that conditions had eased in Sydney, but to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Housing price growth had slowed over 2017 in Sydney, but had remained strong in Melbourne. A similar pattern was evident in auction clearance rates, which had declined by more in Sydney than in Melbourne. Auction volumes had also remained relatively low in Sydney. Rent increases had remained low in most cities and rents had continued to decline in Perth. ", "Members noted that the national accounts for the June quarter would be released the day after the meeting and that an increase in the quarterly growth rate of GDP was likely. Solid growth in retail sales suggested that household consumption growth was likely to have risen in the June quarter. However, retailers had discounted prices to achieve sales, which meant that growth in nominal retail sales had been more modest. ", "Non-mining business investment was expected to have increased in the June quarter, based on recent data. Forward-looking indicators such as capacity utilisation and investment intentions from business surveys suggested a further pick-up was in prospect, consistent with the Bank's forecast for growth in non-mining investment to strengthen gradually. Non-residential building approvals had picked up strongly over preceding months and non-mining investment intentions for 2017/18 reported in the ABS capital expenditure survey had been revised upwards. The data still pointed to modest growth at best, but the survey covers only around half of non-mining investment; growth in investment in the other parts of the non-mining sector, such as education and health, had been stronger. ", "Mining investment was expected to have declined in the June quarter and the capital expenditure survey pointed to a further, but moderate, fall in 2017/18 as expected. Members noted that strength in public investment was expected in the subsequent couple of years, driven by the program of current and planned infrastructure projects. ", "Members also noted that profits in the mining sector had remained high, in line with commodity prices, despite a decline in the June quarter, and that profits in the non-mining sector had strengthened over the year to the June quarter, following earlier weakness. "], "International Economic Conditions": ["Turning to global economic developments, members noted that conditions in the world economy had remained positive, although inflation pressures remained subdued. ", " Members noted that GDP growth in the three largest advanced economies had picked up in the June quarter, driven by faster growth in business investment and continued strong consumption growth. Accommodative policy settings had helped sustain growth above estimates of potential for several years. The outlook for business investment had improved for all three economies and the outlook for growth in consumption remained positive in light of continued improvements in labour markets. Unemployment rates in the United States and Japan remained below estimates of full employment. Although spare capacity remained in the euro area labour market, unemployment rates had fallen in most countries and GDP per capita had been growing. Nevertheless, growth in wages had not increased materially in any of the major economies and core inflation remained low. In recent months, core inflation had been declining in the United States and Japan. Headline inflation rates had also declined, largely because of the earlier decline in oil prices. ", "In China, GDP growth had been a little stronger than expected over the first half of 2017, supported by generally accommodative policy settings. Strong growth in infrastructure investment had continued in July, and further sharp increases in crude steel production and electricity generation had continued to support imports of coal and iron ore from Australia. In the rest of east Asia, a pick-up in export growth as global demand strengthened had underpinned stronger domestic demand. ", "Members discussed the influence of China on the global iron ore and steel markets more generally. They noted that China was by far the largest consumer and importer of iron ore globally. This reflected the fact that China, with the world's largest population, had reached a similar level of steel production per capita to that of industrialised economies. Iron ore prices had been supported at higher levels because of sustained strong demand for steel in China. However, prices were expected to fall in the period ahead because of the ongoing expansion of global iron ore supply following an extended period of strong investment. Members also noted that Chinese steel production per capita was likely to be close to its peak and that growth in Chinese steel production would not add much to global demand for iron ore in the future. Members observed that, in the longer run, there was potential for India to have a noticeable effect on commodity markets as investment in residential construction and transport infrastructure increased. ", "Members discussed the challenges facing the Chinese authorities as they balance their commitment to short-term growth targets with their efforts to address medium-term risks arising from high and rising levels of debt in the Chinese economy. Members also discussed the Chinese authorities' progress in implementing structural reforms announced in 2013 at the Third Plenum. There had been progress on a number of fronts, including a broadened value added tax, some deregulation of interest rates and the relaxation of the one-child policy. However, the authorities' goal of allowing the market to play a ‘decisive role’ in allocating resources was still some way from being realised. In particular, state-owned enterprise reform had been focused on strengthening these firms and increasing the oversight of their activities by the Chinese Communist Party, rather than reducing the influence of state-owned firms in the economy. Members noted that the outcome of the 19th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in mid October would affect the pace and focus of further reforms, and influence how the authorities address the tension between achieving short-term growth aims and managing the build-up of risks to financial stability associated with rising debt levels. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that there had been a muted response in markets to rising tensions on the Korean peninsula. Overall conditions in financial markets had remained very accommodative and volatility had remained low over the preceding month. ", "Long-term government bond yields in the major financial markets had generally declined over the preceding month. US Treasury bond yields had reached the lowest level since the US election, in part reflecting continued uncertainty about the implementation of the administration's policy agenda and lower-than-expected inflation data. While the Federal Reserve was widely expected to commence its balance sheet reduction later in 2017, market pricing indicated that the federal funds rate was not expected to be increased until the second half of 2018. Members noted that yields on US government bills that mature in early October had increased, reflecting concerns that US legislators might not raise the US debt ceiling in time to meet funding requirements. ", "The yield on Australian 10-year government bonds had changed little over the preceding month. The spread of Australian 10-year government bonds to US Treasuries had widened over recent months, which was also the case for spreads to US Treasuries of a number of other sovereign bonds. ", "Major share markets had declined a little over the preceding month, in part reflecting rising geopolitical tension. ", "Major market corporate bond spreads to sovereign bonds were around their lowest levels since the onset of the global financial crisis and overall funding conditions for companies remained favourable. ", "In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had depreciated a little further in trade-weighted terms over the preceding month to be lower than before the US election. However, it was still well above levels at the end of the period of expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in 2014. In trade-weighted terms, the Japanese yen and the euro had been little changed over August, with the latter having appreciated over preceding months to be around late-2014 levels. The Australian dollar was little changed over August, in both US dollar and trade-weighted terms. The appreciation of the Australian dollar over the course of 2017 had, in large part, reflected a broadly based depreciation of the US dollar. ", "In China, tighter enforcement of capital controls by the authorities had contributed to a reduction in capital outflows in 2017 and had been accompanied by an appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar. Bond yields had also increased since the end of 2016 in line with some tightening in financial conditions. Members observed that financial market conditions in China nevertheless remained accommodative overall. ", "In Australia, growth in housing credit had remained steady during 2017; slower growth in lending to investors had been offset by stronger growth in lending to owner-occupiers. Members observed that, while growth in housing lending by the major banks had slowed over 2017, growth in housing lending by smaller lenders had increased. This partly reflected the response of the major banks to the measures introduced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) earlier in the year in relation to interest-only lending, which makes up a larger share of lending by major banks than by other lenders. Members also noted that loan approvals for new dwellings had continued to increase over 2017. ", "Average lending rates were estimated to have increased slightly over 2017, reflecting higher interest rates for investors and borrowers with interest-only loans. Members noted that the average interest rate on new variable-rate loans was estimated to be around 30 basis points below that on outstanding loans. ", "Overall, major banks' funding costs were estimated to have declined gradually over 2017. Combined with the increase in average lending rates, the implied spread between the average outstanding lending and funding rates for banks was estimated to have edged higher over 2017. Also, spreads for Australian residential mortgage-backed securities had declined over the prior year and issuance had been strong relative to the average of the post-financial crisis period. ", "Profits reported by Australian listed companies in August had generally increased compared with a year earlier, although they had been somewhat below expectations. Share prices across the major sectors were higher than a year earlier, particularly for resource companies, reflecting higher commodity prices. ", "Financial market pricing had continued to indicate that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged throughout 2017, with some expectation of an increase in the cash rate by mid 2018. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the data received over the prior month confirmed that global economic conditions had strengthened since 2016. Labour markets had continued to tighten and above-trend growth was expected in a number of advanced economies. Growth in wages and inflation had generally remained subdued and core inflation had eased a little. In China, continued strong growth in infrastructure investment had supported demand for commodities, although medium-term risks associated with high and rising debt levels remained. ", "Conditions in global financial markets had generally remained very accommodative; long-term bond yields in the major financial markets had declined and volatility had been low. No further monetary easing was expected in the major economies and the US Federal Reserve was expected to raise the federal funds rate further in the period ahead. ", "Members noted that the Australian economy had grown at a below-trend rate over 2016/17. The data on domestic activity received over the prior month had, on balance, been positive and consistent with a gradual pick-up in growth as forecast. Members noted that conditions had been conducive to a pick-up in non-mining investment for some time and the latest data on investment expectations pointed to this occurring, which was a welcome development. The decline in mining investment was diminishing and strength in public infrastructure investment was expected. Residential investment appeared to have passed its peak, but was expected to remain at a high level for some time. ", "Employment growth had been broadly based across the states, suggesting that the adjustment to the end of the mining investment boom was nearing completion. Solid growth in employment was expected to continue, which would support household incomes and thus spending in the period ahead. Members acknowledged the risks to this scenario from growth in housing debt having outpaced the slow growth in household incomes over the preceding few years. Growth in wages and inflation had remained low but stable. This was expected to remain the case for some time. Nevertheless, a gradual increase in growth in wages and inflation was expected as the spare capacity in the labour market was reduced and the economy continued to strengthen, supported by the low level of interest rates.

There had been clearer signs of an easing in conditions in the Sydney market but less so in Melbourne, where prices had continued to grow strongly. Borrowing for housing had continued to outpace growth in incomes, although the composition had shifted towards owner-occupiers, with higher interest rates for investors in housing reflecting the ongoing effects of APRA's recent measures to strengthen lending standards in this area.

Growth in public demand and non-mining business investment had picked up and private sector investment intentions for 2017/18, as recorded in the June quarter ABS capital expenditure survey, had been revised higher. ", " There had been a pick-up in household consumption growth in the June quarter despite ongoing weakness in household disposable income growth. Members noted that consumption growth had increased in most states, although it had remained noticeably weaker in Western Australia than in the eastern states, consistent with weaker income growth in that state. Recent strong growth in employment across all the states was expected to support income growth, and therefore consumption growth, in the period ahead. ", " Both full-time and part-time employment had recorded solid growth in August. Members noted that this growth had been well above that required to absorb increases in the labour force owing to population growth. Since early 2017, employment growth had been above trend, the unemployment rate and other measures of labour underutilisation had declined a little (although the unemployment rate had remained steady at 5.6 per cent in recent months) and labour force participation had increased, particularly for older workers and prime-aged (25–54 year old) females. By industry, employment growth over the preceding year had been strongest in the household services sector, particularly health care and education, and had picked up notably in the construction sector. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, including data on job advertisements, vacancies and hiring intentions, continued to point to slightly above-average growth in employment over the remainder of 2017. ", " Members observed that residential construction appeared to have plateaued, with dwelling investment largely unchanged in the June quarter. The pipeline of work already approved or under way was expected to continue supporting dwelling investment around current levels over the subsequent year or so; the peak of apartment completions was expected to occur during this period. At the current level of dwelling investment, growth of the housing stock was expected to outstrip that of the population, as it had done in the preceding few years. ", " Established housing market conditions had continued to ease in Sydney and Melbourne, but had been broadly unchanged in other cities. This pattern was evident in revised housing price data released by CoreLogic in September, as well as in auction clearance rates. Housing prices had continued to decline gradually in Perth. Nationwide measures of housing prices had increased by around 9 per cent over the year to September. ", " Members noted that the national accounts indicated that private non-mining business investment had increased in the June quarter to be almost 10 per cent higher than at the start of 2016, following an upward revision to non-residential construction in the March quarter. Mining investment had declined a little in the June quarter. The outlook for non-mining business investment remained positive; firms’ estimates of future capital spending had increased, non-mining sector profits had picked up over the preceding year and survey measures of capacity utilisation were well above average. Members noted that business conditions, as reported in surveys, had picked up in most states, although they remained subdued in Western Australia. ", " Public demand had picked up in the June quarter. Public consumption had increased solidly and new public investment had risen very strongly across most states. This recent strength had been supported by a number of large infrastructure projects, especially related to the construction of roads and railways. Given the large pipeline of public infrastructure work that had been announced or was under way, public investment was expected to continue supporting economic activity over the next couple of years. Members noted that some of this work would be undertaken by the private sector on behalf of the public sector. There had been liaison reports that this had led to some increase in private sector investment in machinery and equipment. ", " Export volumes had rebounded strongly in the June quarter. Members noted that the increase in resource export volumes had been pronounced, driven by the ongoing ramp-up in liquefied natural gas production. The terms of trade had declined in the June quarter, reflecting lower bulk commodity prices. The terms of trade were likely to have been relatively steady in the September quarter, as the recent falls in iron ore prices had occurred late in the quarter. These falls were largely related to weaker-than-expected data on Chinese industrial production and investment and expectations of cuts to Chinese steel production. Bulk commodity prices had been higher than expected over the preceding year. Members noted that some mining companies had used higher prices to pay down debt and that there had been reports of plans to increase capital investment to sustain the output of existing resource projects. ", " Recent data had pointed to subdued price pressures across the economy in the June quarter. Retail electricity prices were expected to increase significantly in the September quarter and liaison with businesses had suggested that a number of firms, particularly in the retail and manufacturing sectors, were largely absorbing increases in energy costs into margins rather than passing them through to final prices. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that indicators of global economic conditions had remained consistent with growth continuing around recent rates. Indicators of industrial production had picked up in many of Australia's trading partners since 2016, which had contributed to a rise in investment growth and investment intentions in many of these economies. Members noted that growth in exports of electronics and conditions in the electronics-manufacturing sector had increased significantly. This had been particularly stimulatory for the high-income Asian economies. Labour markets had continued to tighten in the major advanced economies, but nominal wage growth had remained low. Headline inflation had increased modestly over the previous month, in line with an increase in oil prices, but core inflation had remained subdued and had even declined lately in the United States. ", " In China, growth in output appeared to have moderated a little in recent months following stronger-than-expected growth in the first half of 2017. Growth in industrial production and fixed asset investment had eased a little in recent months, while growth in consumption had been relatively resilient. Property price inflation in China had continued to moderate, but a range of other indicators of activity in the housing sector had been more resilient than expected. ", " GDP growth in the major advanced economies had increased over the preceding year, driven by continued strong growth in consumption and, in some cases, investment. Members noted that this had been accompanied by a further tightening in labour markets. In the United States and Japan, unemployment rates had been at multi-decade lows and were below most estimates of full employment. The euro area unemployment rate had declined to its lowest rate in eight years, although there was significant variation across member economies. Nominal wage growth and core inflation had remained low. Inflation in the major advanced economies was expected to increase towards central banks’ targets over the next few years, as the lack of spare capacity started to put upward pressure on wages and prices. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that long-term government bond yields had generally increased over the previous month. The increase has been partly in response to higher-than-expected, although still modest, headline inflation data and further announcements by central banks relating to the gradual reduction of monetary policy stimulus. Nevertheless, long-term government bond yields remained at low levels and overall conditions in financial markets remained accommodative, with volatility at a low level. ", " As had been widely expected, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced at its September meeting that in October it would begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The median of FOMC members’ projections for the federal funds rate continued to point to another policy rate increase in 2017 and further increases in 2018. Market pricing continued to suggest that the federal funds rate was expected to increase more slowly than this. ", " The Bank of Canada increased its policy rate in September in response to stronger-than-expected economic growth. Market participants were now pricing in two further increases in the first half of 2018. At its September meeting, the Bank of England indicated that some tightening in the policy rate was likely to be appropriate in coming months. Market pricing suggested that two rate increases were expected to occur by mid 2018. The European Central Bank (ECB) said that a decision about the future of its asset purchase program was likely to be made in October. The ECB was widely thought to be considering extending the scheme into 2018, but reducing the pace of asset purchases. ", " Members observed that, over September, the actual and expected removal of monetary policy stimulus had contributed to the increase in long-term government bond yields across the major markets. One exception was Japan, where the Bank of Japan's policy of yield curve control remained in place, involving a 0 per cent target for 10-year Japanese government bonds. ", " Members noted that the yield on Australian 10-year government bonds had increased over September in response to both global financial market developments and stronger-than-expected domestic economic data, although the yield remained low. Yields on Australian 10-year government bonds had risen by more than yields on US Treasuries over preceding months, which was also the case for a number of other sovereign bonds. ", " Financial conditions remained highly favourable for companies in major markets. Global share prices had risen over 2017, supported by rising corporate earnings and the improved outlook for global growth. Major market corporate bond spreads to sovereign bonds had continued to narrow over 2017, to be at the lowest level in 10 years. ", " Financial conditions also remained accommodative in emerging markets, with increases in share prices and declines in government bond yields in 2017. Foreign capital had flowed into these markets seeking higher returns in the global environment of low yields. ", " Members noted that there had been relatively little movement in most exchange rates over September. The Australian dollar had been little changed over September after having appreciated since mid 2017, partly reflecting a lower US dollar. The Chinese renminbi had depreciated a little in September after having appreciated significantly over preceding months. ", " In Australia, financial conditions for companies remained accommodative, with price-to-earnings ratios above average and corporate bond spreads at a decade low. Members observed that, nevertheless, companies’ demand for external finance had not increased. Net equity raisings had been subdued and corporate bonds outstanding had been little changed over 2017. ", " Australian housing credit growth had been relatively stable over 2017, with slowing growth in lending to investors offset by slightly higher growth in lending to owner-occupiers. Members noted, however, that growth in lending to investors had stabilised in July and August. There had been little change in Australian banks’ variable lending rates over September, although some banks had lowered interest rates on fixed-rate loans, with the largest declines for fixed-rate interest-only loans to investors. ", " Financial market pricing continued to indicate that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged during the remainder of 2017, although expectations of a rate rise in 2018 had increased and a 25 basis point rise was fully priced in for the second half of 2018. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " The strengthening in global economic conditions had reduced some near-term risks to financial stability arising from rare or extreme events. However, low interest rates and low financial market volatility had promoted financial risk-taking, with high and rising asset prices and debt increasing the risk of a disruptive correction. In China, financial risks remained pronounced. The level of corporate debt in China was particularly high for the country's stage of economic development. The extent to which this borrowing had occurred through opaque and less regulated channels added to the risks. Members noted that Chinese banks’ off-balance sheet activities complicated an assessment of the resilience of the financial system. Globally, banks’ profitability and capital ratios had increased over the preceding year. ", " Domestically, household balance sheets remained a key area of attention for policymakers. Household indebtedness remained high and had edged higher in an environment of low interest rates and weak income growth. Despite this, members noted that, relative to income, households’ borrowing from banks, net of offset balances, was only slightly higher than it had been a decade earlier. Interest payments relative to income had declined over the previous decade owing to the reduction in interest rates. However, the high level of debt also meant that households were sensitive to any increases in borrowing interest rates. Members also observed that household assets far exceeded debt, with non-housing assets alone being over two times larger than total household debt. The household savings rate was higher than in the early 2000s, although it had declined over the previous few years in the environment of low income growth. ", " Members discussed the effects of supervisory measures taken by regulators to curtail riskier borrowing for housing. Interest-only lending as a share of new lending had declined substantially following the introduction of a 30 per cent cap for this lending by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) early in 2017. The share of lending at loan-to-valuation ratios exceeding 90 per cent had also declined. Following the introduction of the supervisory measures, borrowing by investors had been growing more slowly, offset by slightly higher growth in borrowing by owner-occupiers. ", " Members discussed trends in housing demand, supply and prices given the high level of household debt and the importance of housing as collateral in the banking system. A large number of apartments were expected to be completed in 2018 and 2019 in the largest cities, following several years of increasing apartment construction. Members noted that strong population growth had seen demand for inner-city apartments in Melbourne absorb the city's large increase in supply. Generally, demand for smaller apartments targeted at foreign buyers in the major cities had eased. Prices and rents of inner-city apartments had fallen slightly in Brisbane and also in Perth, where economic conditions were weaker. ", " Australian banks had continued to tighten their commercial property lending standards and their overall commercial property exposures had declined a little over the preceding year. This had been offset by strong growth in the commercial property exposures of Asian banks in Australia. Unlike previous episodes of strong expansion in lending by foreign banks, this had not seemed to have led to an easing in lending standards by Australian banks. Members noted that banks’ retail property exposures had continued to grow as retail developments were repurposed to be more flexible given the changing composition of retailing. ", " Members observed that the profits of Australian banks remained at a high level, which was enabling the banks to increase their capital through retained earnings and dividend reinvestment schemes. The banks had substantially increased their capital ratios since the onset of the financial crisis. Consequently, the major banks were already close to meeting APRA's new target for ‘unquestionably strong’ capital ratios to be applied from 2020 and the smaller banks generally already exceeded the higher capital requirements. The banks had also increased their liquid asset holdings and their Liquidity Coverage Ratios were well above the 100 per cent minimum requirement. ", " Australian banks’ non-performing loans were a very low share of their assets compared with banks in other advanced economies. Overall, banks’ non-performing loan share had declined over the preceding year, with a fall for business lending more than offsetting a small rise for household loans. Members noted that the increase in non-performing housing loans was most pronounced in Western Australia, where the labour market was weakest and housing prices had fallen. Nevertheless, the share of non-performing loans in Western Australia remained at a low level. Further, most non-performing loans remained well secured across all states. ", " Members noted that housing loans as a share of banks’ domestic credit had increased markedly over the preceding two decades. APRA intended to publish a discussion paper later in 2017 addressing the concentration of banks’ exposures to housing. Members also noted that APRA had intensified its focus on Australian banks strengthening their risk culture. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that economic conditions internationally and domestically had been more positive since 2016. Growth in global trade and production had strengthened and the sources of growth had broadened. Unemployment rates in the advanced economies had declined, but the tighter conditions in labour markets had not flowed through to higher growth in wages or broader inflation pressures. Members also noted that asset valuations were generally quite high. ", " A number of major central banks had either started to reduce the degree of monetary stimulus or were considering doing so. Nevertheless, financial market pricing suggested that policy rates were expected to remain low for some time. Members observed that moves towards higher interest rates in other economies were a welcome development, but did not have mechanical implications for the setting of policy in Australia, where the timing of any changes in interest rates would be dependent, as always, on developments in domestic economic conditions. Members also noted that monetary conditions in other advanced economies had been eased significantly more than in Australia since the onset of the financial crisis. ", " Domestically, the increase in GDP growth in the June quarter confirmed that some of the weakness in the previous quarter had been temporary and was consistent with expectations that growth would increase gradually over the coming year, supported by the current stance of monetary policy. Members noted that the increase in spending on public infrastructure projects was supporting a brighter outlook for activity in the non-mining sector. At the same time, recent data continued to indicate that the drag on growth from the end of the mining investment boom was nearing completion. ", " The current and prospective strength in employment growth in Australia was expected to support household spending in the period ahead, although slow growth in real wages and high levels of household debt were likely to be constraining influences. Remaining spare capacity meant that wage and price increases had been subdued. Wage growth was expected to increase gradually as spare capacity in the labour market diminished, which was in turn expected to contribute to a gradual rise in inflation over time. ", " The appreciation of the Australian dollar since mid 2017, partly reflecting a lower US dollar, was expected to contribute to ongoing subdued price pressures. A material further appreciation of the exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast. ", " The most recent information about conditions in the established housing market suggested that growth in housing prices had eased from the previously brisk pace in some cities, most notably Sydney, and had remained soft in some others. Housing debt had been outpacing the slow growth in household incomes for some time. Recently, growth in credit to investors in housing had eased a little, although overall growth in household credit had been little changed. Members discussed the importance of continuing to assess the various risks in household balance sheets. ", " Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},

Based on the data available and in line with earlier expectations, growth appeared to have been slightly below average in the December quarter and over 2015 as a whole. There had been further indications of a rebalancing of activity towards the non-mining sectors of the economy. More recent data had suggested that the economy had continued to grow at a moderate pace in early 2016. ", " As expected, mining investment had fallen further in the December quarter as more large projects reached completion. The latest ABS capital expenditure (capex) survey of firms' investment intentions had pointed to further large falls in mining investment in 2015/16 and again in 2016/17, in line with the forecasts presented in the February <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. Members noted that non-mining investment appeared to have been little changed over 2015. Although the capex survey had pointed to declines in 2015/16 and 2016/17, roughly half of non-mining investment was not covered by the capex survey and in the past there had been differences between signals provided by the capex survey and what was measured in the national accounts data. At the same time, members noted that survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained at above-average levels and business credit growth had increased a little further over recent months. ", " Members observed that there had been only modest growth in resource export volumes in the December quarter. They noted that more production capacity – particularly for liquefied natural gas, but also iron ore – was expected to come on line over 2016. Chinese iron ore imports had increased over the past year, although by less than earlier years, and Australia's share of that had remained at a high level. The volume of coal exports had fallen, partly because Chinese demand for coal had eased. Meanwhile, iron ore prices had increased over the past month, while coal prices had fallen slightly. Notwithstanding the recent increases in iron ore prices, bulk commodity prices were still about 20 per cent below levels of a year earlier. Oil prices had been volatile over recent months, rising somewhat since the previous meeting but still lower than late last year, which largely reflected the ongoing strength of supply. ", " Members noted that household demand had continued to be supported by low interest rates and above-average employment growth. Consumption growth was expected to have been close to its average over 2015 and in early 2016. Survey measures of households' perceptions of their own finances had remained at above-average levels into early 2016. Information from the Bank's retail liaison suggested that there had been an improvement in trading conditions around the Christmas–New Year period. ", " While growth in dwelling investment had been strong over 2015, there were indications that it would gradually moderate over the course of this year. The level of building approvals had declined over 2015, but remained high. Conditions in the established housing market had eased since late 2015. Housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne was lower than in September last year. Meanwhile, housing credit growth overall had remained around 7½ per cent, after having risen through to the middle of 2015. Members noted that growth in lending to investors in housing had slowed significantly over that period and, more recently, housing loan approvals overall had declined a little. ", " The unemployment rate rose to 6 per cent in January, from around 5¾ per cent in November and December, and employment had declined slightly. Nevertheless, conditions in the labour market had clearly improved since early 2015. Employment growth had been above average, the unemployment rate had declined by a little more than ¼ percentage point and the participation rate had been on an upward trend. Members noted that there was some uncertainty around the future trajectory of the participation rate. This was partly because the degree to which people had been encouraged to enter the labour force over the course of the past year had been unexpected, and partly because it was difficult to assess the net effect on the participation rate of population ageing (which tends to reduce participation rates). The fact that each generation has tended to have a higher participation rate than the one preceding it also contributed to uncertainty around the trajectory of the participation rate. Meanwhile, leading indicators of employment had increased recently, consistent with employment growth in the months ahead. ", " Data from the wage price index had confirmed that wage growth was low across all industries over 2015. Although wage growth had continued to slow in a number of mining-exposed industries, it appeared to have stabilised in some industries where employment growth had been relatively strong over the course of the past year. Members observed that ongoing low wage growth was consistent with there being some spare capacity in the labour market, though they also noted that this was not unique to Australia, which suggested that a common global factor, such as the increasingly globalised nature of the labour force, could have been playing a role. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Growth in Australia's major trading partners had eased in the December quarter, although it had been little changed over the past year at slightly below its decade average. Labour market conditions had improved in a number of economies, which was consistent with ongoing consumption growth, particularly in the United States and the euro area. Aggregate growth had also been supported by low oil prices. Although measures of core inflation had edged higher over the second half of 2015 in Japan and the euro area, they had shown some signs of declining in the early part of 2016. There had been a more noticeable increase in core inflation in the United States over this period. However, inflation remained below most central banks' targets and monetary policies had remained very expansionary. ", " Growth in the US economy had been close to trend over 2015, despite slowing late in the year. Employment had continued to grow more rapidly than the working-age population, and the unemployment rate was around its long-run average level. While nominal wage growth had remained relatively modest, growth in unit labour costs was above its long-run average. Measures of core inflation had picked up, but remained below the inflation objective of the Federal Reserve Board. The euro area economy had continued to expand at an above-trend rate over 2015, driven by domestic demand, although industrial activity had remained weak. There had been a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate, but there was considerable spare capacity and wage growth had drifted lower. Inflation had remained low relative to the European Central Bank's target. ", " GDP had contracted in Japan in the December quarter, driven by a decline in consumption. Despite recent weakness in economic activity, labour market conditions had remained tight and nominal wage growth had been positive. Core inflation had picked up to close to 1 per cent by the end of 2015, but had eased a little in early 2016. Headline inflation had been low, reflecting the effect of lower oil prices. In the rest of east Asia, GDP growth had been a bit below average, particularly for the economies with larger exposures to the slowing in China through their direct trade links. Recent exchange rate depreciations, low oil prices and monetary and fiscal stimulus measures had been providing some support for activity in the east Asian region. ", " Recent Chinese data had pointed to continued weakness in the industrial and real estate sectors, although members noted that the variable timing of the Chinese New Year holidays made it difficult to interpret data in the early part of the calendar year. Overall, housing prices had increased a little over the past year, but prices had still declined in the smaller cities. Total sales had declined since mid 2015 and the stock of unsold housing remained substantial. In February, the authorities took further steps to support the demand for housing, particularly in markets where housing prices had been weakest. The downward trend in both exports and imports had continued in January, while the trade surplus remained at a high level. ", " Members spent part of the meeting discussing some issues relevant to China's longer-run economic performance and the risks to growth. They observed that demographic changes and strong productivity growth had been key drivers of economic growth in China for some time, but these forces were now reversing and were likely to weigh on future growth as a result. In particular, China's growth had been supported by an increase in the size of the working-age population and the migration of many agricultural workers to urban areas, where they had been more productive. The working-age population had started to fall but the urban workforce was still growing because of continued urbanisation. China's urbanisation rate was still relatively low by international standards, which suggested that this process had further to run, with the pace of reform to the urban registration system (<em>hukou</em>) likely to have some effect on how rapidly the growth of the urban workforce would moderate. Structural reform was also important for the future trajectory of productivity growth, which had slowed over the past decade. ", " China's economic development had been characterised by very strong investment growth, which had been funded to a significant extent by high saving rates in the household sector. An element of the policy response to the global financial crisis had been to increase the credit available to the non-financial corporate and government sectors, which had led to sizeable increases in the debt held by these sectors. Slowing aggregate growth and excess capacity in some industries had raised the risk that some firms would find it more difficult to make repayments on their debt, which could, at some point, be associated with more widespread financial problems. Notwithstanding this, members noted that household debt-to-income ratios and the share of debt denominated in foreign currency were both low. The low level of foreign currency debt, in particular, differentiated China from other emerging economies that had previously experienced financial crises. While the overhang of residential housing inventory and excess capacity in the industrial sector would affect demand for Australia's resource exports and their prices, the scope for Chinese household incomes to rise over time created long-run potential for Australia to increase exports of rural produce and services, including tourism, to China. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial markets with a review of movements in a range of markets following the Bank of Japan's unexpected lowering of the interest rate for some deposits held at the central bank in order to provide further stimulus. This decision led to significant movements in fixed income and foreign exchange markets in particular, and had also highlighted concerns over bank profits in an environment of low or negative interest rates. Members noted that implementation of the policy decision had been designed to minimise the adverse effect on the Japanese banking system; although the negative rate is effectively the marginal rate on excess funds and therefore had pushed other short-term rates lower, most central bank deposits continued to be remunerated with a positive rate. ", " Expectations of further increases in the US federal funds rate had been pushed out over the past month, with markets now pricing in only a 70 per cent chance of a further rate rise in 2016 and some market participants expecting a reduction in the federal funds rate this year. In contrast, expectations for additional monetary easing by the European Central Bank this year had increased over the past month, including at the next policy meeting later in the month. ", " Recent policy developments had contributed to further falls in sovereign bond yields. Members noted that the Japanese government bond yield curve was very flat, with the 10-year bond yield below zero. Almost two-thirds of Japanese government bonds and one-third of short-term bonds issued by euro area governments were currently trading at yields below zero. Australian government bond yields had moved broadly in line with US sovereign bonds. ", " The sharp declines in global share prices in early February, led by financial sector shares, had, more recently, been partly retraced by price rises. Australian equity prices declined by 2 per cent over February, with movements in prices closely linked to changes in commodity prices. Members noted the generally solid profit reports of Australian listed companies and discussed recent developments in relation to dividend policies. ", " Share prices of banks in the advanced economies, including Australia, had fallen significantly since early January. The declines had been largest in Europe and Japan. Globally, there had been concerns about the effect of the prevailing low or negative interest rates on interest margins and yields on banks' high-quality liquid asset holdings and, ultimately, on bank profits and business models. These concerns had been compounded in the euro area by specific issues in particular countries as well as uncertainty about the operation of the new European bank resolution regime. ", " In foreign exchange markets, volatility increased over the previous month alongside the changing current and prospective stance of monetary policy in the major economies. The US dollar had depreciated slightly on a trade-weighted basis, while the euro was little changed. Since the policy announcement by the Bank of Japan, the yen had appreciated by 5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The Chinese authorities had emphasised their intention to preserve stability in the trade-weighted value of the renminbi, which had moved in only a narrow range over the past year. The People's Bank of China had continued to sell foreign currency reserves in January in response to net private capital outflow. The Australian dollar was little changed on a trade-weighted basis and against the US dollar since the previous meeting. ", " Bond issuance by Australian banks had been solid in the first quarter to date, despite volatility in global financial markets in the period. Wholesale funding costs for Australian banks had continued to edge higher, but for long-term funding the cost of issuing new paper was still below the average cost of the existing stock on issue. The rise in short-term wholesale bank funding costs had been passed through to some business lending rates. ", " Pricing in domestic financial markets indicated that there was no expectation of a change in the cash rate at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the recent data on the international and domestic economies had been largely consistent with the outlook presented at the previous meeting. Growth in Australia's major trading partners had remained a little below average in year-ended terms and commodity prices were still significantly lower than they had been a year earlier. Meanwhile, global financial markets had been volatile in the aftermath of the Bank of Japan's decision to implement negative interest rates and generally there appeared to be more uncertainty about the direction and potency of monetary policy in the major jurisdictions. However, given the usual lags in the data, it was still too early to assess whether the bout of financial market volatility since the turn of the year foreshadowed or would lead to a weakening in global economic conditions. Globally, monetary policy remained very accommodative. ", " The available data suggested that the domestic economy had continued to grow at a slightly below-trend pace. There had also been further signs of a rebalancing of activity towards non-mining sectors of the economy, aided by the low level of interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate over the past couple of years, which had responded to the evolving economic outlook. There was a small decline in employment in January and a modest rise in the unemployment rate, following a run of much better-than-expected outcomes in the December quarter. Leading indicators of employment had increased further and were consistent with employment growth in the months ahead. Wage growth had remained at quite low levels. ", " Conditions in the established housing market had eased somewhat since September 2015, in part reflecting the effect of supervisory measures implemented in that year. In addition, after rising for some time, the growth in aggregate housing credit had stabilised over the past six months or so, with a significant easing in growth in lending to investors. ", " Members judged that there were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the economy and that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged at an accommodative setting. Over the period ahead, new information should allow the Board to assess whether the improvement in labour market conditions was continuing and whether the recent financial turbulence presaged weaker global and domestic demand. Members noted that continued low inflation would provide scope to ease monetary policy further, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand.

Headline and trimmed mean inflation had both been 1.8 per cent over the year to the September quarter, broadly in line with the Bank's expectations.", " Retail price inflation had been low as competitive pressures in the retail sector had continued to restrain price rises. Prices for volatile items, such as fruit and vegetables, had fallen by more than expected. The appreciation of the exchange rate over the preceding two years had contributed somewhat to falls in the prices of tradeable goods, while increases in rents had also been small, consistent with the strong growth in the housing stock. Although these factors had weighed on inflation, a number of factors had been working in the opposite direction, including increases in tobacco excise, utilities prices and new dwelling construction costs. ", " Members noted that the outlook for inflation would be influenced by the persistence of heightened competitive pressures, the outlook for wage growth and the speed with which wage costs might flow through to higher prices. They observed that competitive pressures had led food and other retailers to alter their business models in an effort to reduce their cost structures. These competitive pressures on both retail margins and costs were expected to continue for quite some time.", " The Bank's forecast was for underlying inflation to remain slightly below 2 per cent in the near term, before increasing gradually to 2 per cent. Headline inflation was expected to rise to 2¼ per cent by the end of the forecast period, reflecting further increases in the tobacco excise and utilities prices in addition to the gradual pick-up in underlying inflation. Recent increases in fuel prices were expected to boost headline inflation in the December quarter. ", " The forecast gradual rise in inflation was consistent with the expectation that a further tightening in labour market conditions would gradually feed into higher wage pressures. Although survey measures and the Bank's liaison suggested firms were finding it more difficult to recruit some types of labour, various measures of growth in wages had not yet picked up and had been lower in preceding quarters than forecast a year earlier. Members observed that, in most advanced economies, growth in wages and hourly earnings had been low despite ongoing reductions in spare capacity. They discussed the possibility that globalisation and technology were leading wage growth to be less responsive to changes in the demand for labour, which could continue for a while.", " Members noted that the weights used to construct the Consumer Price Index (CPI) would be updated in the December quarter. Following the release of the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics' Household Expenditure Survey, the weights of some items in the CPI, such as international travel and restaurant meals, would increase to reflect changes in consumption related to rising household income. The weights of some other items in the CPI, such as tobacco and audiovisual equipment, would shift because consumers had responded to changes in their prices relative to the prices of other goods and services. The inflation forecasts had been revised down a little to reflect this reweighting and because more frequent reweighting in future would reduce the ‘substitution bias’ in measured inflation. Substitution bias arises because fixed weights do not capture consumers' tendency to increase consumption of those goods and services that have become cheaper relative to other goods and services. Members noted, however, that this did not change the Bank's assessment of how inflationary pressures were likely to evolve in the forecast period.", " Turning to indicators of economic activity, retail sales had been weak in the September quarter, which was expected to translate into lower quarterly consumption growth than in the June quarter. Members noted that the outlook for consumption growth depended on the outlook for household income growth, which remained uncertain. They discussed the possibility that households might change their consumption and saving decisions if the period of low income growth persisted. Members observed that the level of consumption in the previous few years had been revised higher in the most recent annual national accounts (for 2016/17), which implied a downward revision to the household saving ratio.", " In the residential housing market, recent data on dwelling approvals had confirmed that the pipeline of dwellings approved or under construction appeared to have peaked in late 2016, although the pipeline of work remained at a high level. This was expected to support the level of dwelling investment over the following year or so. Conditions in the established housing market had eased in Sydney, while housing prices had changed little in Brisbane and Perth over recent months. Conditions in both the auction and private treaty markets had remained somewhat stronger in Melbourne than elsewhere. Rents had continued to fall in Perth and had been slightly lower in Brisbane, where valuations for some new inner-city apartments had declined below their purchase prices. Members discussed the importance of understanding the evolution of demographic factors and foreign demand for interpreting developments in housing markets across states.", " Data revisions over the previous year had boosted recorded growth in non-mining business investment in the preceding few years, partly resolving some of the inconsistency between its previously reported weakness and broader economic conditions. Forward-looking indicators of non-residential construction activity had pointed to further strength in the near term, and the pipeline of public infrastructure projects had remained high. Members noted that public infrastructure spending had boosted the activity of firms undertaking this work on behalf of the public sector, which could create positive spillovers to private business investment.", " Survey measures of business conditions and expected capital expenditure over the year ahead had increased. Together with recent upward revisions to recorded non-mining business investment, these indicators suggested there were more upside risks to the non-mining investment forecast than there had been for some time. Members noted that both public and business investment were relatively import-intensive; the positive outlook for these components of activity implied that import volumes were also likely to grow solidly over the forecast period. ", " The volume of exports was estimated to have increased in the September quarter, as coal shipments returned to levels preceding Cyclone Debbie earlier in the year, although exports of liquefied natural gas appeared to have declined because of project delays and lower production at some sites. Members noted that both manufacturing and service exports appeared to have increased in the September quarter. Rural exports were likely to have held up as the decline in wheat exports, following the earlier record harvest, had been offset by an increase in beef exports. Bulk commodity prices had fallen over the preceding months, partly in response to announced cuts in Chinese steel production designed to address environmental concerns, while base metals prices had increased. Oil prices had also increased significantly in response to potential supply disruptions. The terms of trade were expected to fall over the forecast period, in line with previous forecasts, partly because Chinese steel production was projected to decline a little over the medium term at the same time as an expected expansion in the global supply of iron ore. Nonetheless, the terms of trade for Australia were expected to remain above their early-2016 trough.", " Turning to the labour market, members observed that conditions had been surprisingly strong over 2017. Employment growth had been running well above growth in the working-age population and, in preceding months, had been concentrated in full-time employment. Employment growth had also picked up across all states. Some of the increase in demand for labour had been met with increased labour force participation, especially by women and older workers. The unemployment rate had fallen by ¼ percentage point over the year to date to 5.5 per cent.", " Leading indicators suggested that above-average employment growth would continue in coming quarters. More generally, the forecast for employment growth had been revised a little higher, reflecting the run of stronger labour market data in preceding months. The forecast for the participation rate had also been raised for the same reason. This implied little change in the outlook for the unemployment rate, which was forecast to decline gradually to around 5¼ per cent by the end of 2019, consistent with the forecast increase in GDP growth. Members noted that there was uncertainty about how rapidly the unemployment rate might decline, and that the forecast was conditioned on the assumption the participation rate would remain around current levels, underpinned by the cyclical strength in the labour market.", " The Bank's forecasts for growth were largely unchanged from three months earlier. The central forecast was for GDP growth to pick up and to average around 3 per cent over the next few years. Although the staff expected GDP growth to rise, the forecasts suggested that productivity growth would be relatively subdued in the near term. In light of this, members noted that the Productivity Commission had recently completed a review of the policy changes that might have the greatest effect on productivity growth. The review had pointed to the importance of data and evidence-based policymaking in areas such as health, city planning and land use, teacher training and market efficiency, with particular reference to energy markets. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Global growth had strengthened further over 2017, having been reasonably broadly based. China and the major advanced economies had recorded stronger growth than expected in the September quarter, consistent with the upswing in global trade. More recent data implied this strength had continued. Investment had picked up in most economies, which was expected to help sustain the expansion. As a result, the near-term outlook for growth in Australia's major trading partners had been revised a little higher. Unemployment rates in the major economies had been at their lowest levels for a long while. Spare capacity in the labour market appeared to have been fully absorbed in Japan, the United States and Germany, although some spare capacity appeared to remain in other parts of the euro area.", " Members noted that it was possible global growth could be more self-sustaining than currently expected because the capital stock had expanded more quickly than in recent years and labour supply had been more resilient to the effects of population ageing. This had restrained growth in wages, although there had been some signs of wage growth increasing. More generally, an expansion in productive capacity might imply a period where inflation remained low for longer than currently forecast. Indeed, despite stronger GDP growth and further declines in unemployment rates to multi-year lows, inflation had remained low in most economies. ", " Members noted that the outlook for the Chinese economy remained a significant source of uncertainty for the Australian economy. Over the previous year, growth in China had tended to exceed expectations. The services sector had been the largest contributor to growth, while growth in construction and infrastructure spending had been robust despite recent efforts by the authorities to restrain the extent of activity in the housing market. This had underpinned strong Chinese demand for steel, although recently environmental concerns had led the authorities to mandate cuts to steel production.", " The 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party had pointed to broad continuity in economic policy, but placed less emphasis on growth targets and more on tackling risks to financial stability, which suggested financial conditions may be tighter than would have been the case otherwise. Members noted that upstream price pressures had been building in China over the previous year. Other east Asian economies had benefited from the global trade upswing over the previous year. Many of these economies are highly integrated into global production chains, which had recently been evident in a sharp pick-up in their exports of electronic items. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that monetary policy accommodation had continued to lessen gradually in a number of economies.", " In early November, the Bank of England had increased its policy rate for the first time in 10 years and indicated that two more increases were likely to be required over the next few years. Market pricing suggested an increase in the US federal funds rate at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), in line with the median of FOMC members' projections. However, market pricing continued to suggest a more modest increase in the federal funds rate over 2018 than implied by the median FOMC projection.", " Members noted that after sustained expansions in major central banks' balance sheets over many years, these central banks now held sizeable shares of government bonds outstanding in their respective markets. In October, the Federal Reserve had commenced the gradual reduction in its balance sheet, as previously announced, while the European Central Bank had announced that its asset purchases would continue through to September 2018, but at a slower rate. The Bank of Japan had indicated its intention to continue its accommodative monetary policy, including by undertaking substantial purchases of assets.", " Movements in long-term government bond yields across the major markets over October had been mixed, reflecting various data outcomes and changing market expectations about monetary policy settings in response to central bank statements and political developments. However, these movements had generally been small and long-term government bond yields had remained at low levels. Members noted that the yield on Australian 10-year government bonds had been relatively steady at a low level throughout 2017.", " Major equity markets had continued to strengthen, reflecting rising earnings and a positive outlook for economic activity. Low interest rates had also been providing support to equity prices. Share prices had increased particularly strongly in Japan, following the recent elections and the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus in the period ahead. Members observed that the strength in equity markets, particularly for technology stocks, had resulted in equity market valuation measures rising to above-average levels.", " Members observed that financial conditions had remained highly favourable for corporations. Corporate bond spreads in advanced economies had remained low and issuance had been strong, resulting in an increase in corporate leverage. Financial conditions had also remained accommodative in emerging markets; share prices had risen further and government bond yields had remained low as foreign capital had continued to flow into these markets.", " There had been relatively little movement in most exchange rates over the preceding month. The US dollar had appreciated a little since early September, reflecting slightly stronger economic data outcomes and increased expectations for fiscal stimulus. Consistent with this, the differential between US government bond yields and yields on other major economies' financial assets had increased. The Australian dollar had depreciated a little in trade-weighted terms over the previous month – following weaker inflation and retail sales data than had been expected by markets – although it remained a little higher than at the start of the year.", " In Australia, housing credit growth had edged lower in recent months, as lending to owner-occupiers had eased and lending to investors had stabilised at a slower pace. Growth in housing lending by major banks had slowed while that by other lenders had picked up, as major banks had been more affected by the need to restrain interest-only lending in response to the recent supervisory measures. Members observed that the recent sharp declines in interest-only loan approvals suggested that banks had comfortably met the requirement set by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) for interest-only housing loans to comprise less than 30 per cent of new housing lending. ", " Members noted that housing interest rates had increased a little over 2017, particularly for investors and interest-only loans. More recently, variable housing rates had been steady and the interest rate for some fixed-rate loans had declined somewhat. ", " After having been little changed over much of 2017, Australian share prices had increased notably over the preceding month, in line with movements in global equity markets. The increase in Australian share prices had been broadly based across different sectors.", " Australian corporate bond spreads had continued to decline in October and corporate bond issuance had been strong in recent months. Corporate gearing had declined over 2017, with resource companies having used some of the windfall from higher commodity prices to pay down debt. Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) had been strong in 2017. Pricing of RMBS had declined over the year, although it remained slightly above levels of several years ago and substantially higher than before the global financial crisis.", " Expectations of future cash rate movements implied by financial market prices had been scaled back, indicating that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the following year or so. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members considered a detailed review of how the economy had evolved over the preceding year relative to the Bank's forecasts for domestic GDP growth, unemployment and inflation. Overall, the differences for these key variables were within the bounds of historical forecast errors. That said, the outcome for GDP growth had been weaker than expected, reflecting a surprisingly weak outcome in the September quarter 2016. Growth in consumption and dwelling investment over the course of 2016/17 had been lower than forecast at the time of the November 2016 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, while non-mining business investment had grown by more than forecast at that time.", " The recovery in labour market conditions since late 2016 had been stronger than expected, including in Queensland and Western Australia, which suggested the adjustment of the labour market to the downturn in mining investment was nearing completion. Wage growth had been somewhat weaker than expected and had been particularly low in the mining-related parts of the economy. Underlying inflation had picked up a little and had been slightly higher than forecast, but the increase in headline inflation had been smaller than forecast.", " Members noted that over the past year there had been a decline in the unemployment rate and a gradual increase in inflation. These developments were consistent with the flexible inflation-targeting framework, which has allowed the Board to balance the need to support aggregate demand and reduce spare capacity in the labour market with the need to manage risks associated with high and rising household debt.", " Turning to the immediate decision regarding the level of the cash rate, members noted that GDP growth had been stronger than expected in a number of major economies in the September quarter and that the outlook for global economic conditions had continued to improve. Accommodative financial conditions around the world had continued to support above-trend growth. Although unemployment rates had continued to fall, wage growth had been slow to increase in many economies and core inflation had remained low.", " Members noted that the outlook for growth in the Australian economy was largely unchanged from three months previously. GDP growth was expected to increase and average around 3 per cent over the next few years as the drag from mining investment diminished and export growth continued. Growth in both public investment and non-mining business investment was still expected to pick up. In the medium term, consumption was expected to grow at around its average pace following the financial crisis. Dwelling construction was likely to remain high over the following year or so, given the large pipeline of work, but it was not expected to add further to growth.", " Strong employment growth in the preceding year had been met partly by an increase in labour force participation, but the unemployment rate had declined and was forecast to edge lower. Wage growth had remained low. It was expected to increase gradually over the forecast period as spare capacity in the labour market diminished and the dampening effects of compositional changes associated with the adjustment of the economy to the end of the mining investment boom abated. Members noted, however, that there was considerable uncertainty around when and how quickly wage pressures might emerge and about how much these would add to inflationary pressure. In particular, they noted that, among other factors, pressure on margins from strong competition and a faster-than-expected pick-up in productivity growth could delay the pass-through of tighter labour market conditions to inflationary pressure.", " Inflation was expected to increase, but only gradually. The forecasts had been updated to account for short-term factors, such as fluctuations in electricity and petrol prices, as well as for the effect of more frequent reweighting of the CPI in future. Members observed that any further appreciation of the exchange rate would lead to a slower-than-forecast pick-up in inflation and economic activity.", " Conditions in the established housing market had eased in all major cities, but had remained relatively strong in Melbourne. Growth in rents had been subdued. Housing credit growth had eased a little, although it remained faster than household income growth. The profile of new lending had shifted away from interest-only and other riskier types of lending, following the introduction of supervisory measures by APRA to address the medium-term risks associated with high and rising household indebtedness. ", " Taking into account the available information and the Bank's most recent set of forecasts, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent."]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 2 February 2016"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Allan Moss AO, Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary) "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members began their discussion of economic developments by focusing on the domestic economy. They noted that conditions in the labour market had improved while GDP looked to have continued growing at a below-average pace over 2015. The unemployment rate declined to 5.8 per cent in December, employment grew at an above-average rate over 2015 and the participation rate was on an upward trend. The national accounts for the September quarter, released the day after the previous meeting, indicated that GDP growth had picked up as expected in the September quarter, partly because net exports had rebounded following weather-related disruptions in the June quarter. More recent data on activity and trade suggested that output growth had eased in the December quarter and remained below-average in year-ended terms. ", " Members noted that there had been further evidence of activity rebalancing away from the resources sector towards non-resource sectors. Output growth in the services sector, particularly household services, had been strong. The relatively labour-intensive nature of this growth suggested that compositional change may help to reconcile a rise in employment growth to an above-average rate, on the one hand, and output growth remaining below average, on the other. Also, low growth in labour costs was likely to have contributed to an improvement in Australia's international competitiveness and encouraged businesses to employ more labour than otherwise. Members observed that growth in goods-related production appeared to have picked up recently, but remained modest. ", " Turning to developments in the household sector, members noted that growth in household consumption had increased in the September quarter to be close to its decade average in year-ended terms. Growth was expected to be similar in the December quarter, based on recent retail sales data, indications from the Bank's retail liaison that trading conditions had improved in the Christmas and post-Christmas sales period, and surveys suggesting that perceptions of households' own finances remained above average. Household consumption growth had been supported by low interest rates, lower petrol prices and increasing employment, despite relatively subdued household income growth. These factors were expected to support a further increase in consumption growth over the forecast period. ", " Members observed that although the saving ratio had been declining, recent revisions to national accounts data suggested that this decline was not as pronounced as previously thought. As a result, the saving ratio had remained close to 10 per cent over the past five years, which was a significant step up from its average over the previous two decades but not particularly high from a longer-run perspective. ", " Dwelling investment had increased strongly over the year to the September quarter and further growth was anticipated, albeit at a gradually declining rate. This was consistent with building approvals, which were at a high level, although lower than in early 2015. Members noted that some other indicators of dwelling investment, including loan approvals for new construction, had been more positive in recent months. Information from liaison contacts indicated that demand for high-density housing in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had been sufficient to absorb the increase in the supply that had come onto the market, whereas demand had been somewhat weaker in Perth, which had experienced a decline in prices and rents for apartments over the past year. To date, there had not been any substantive signs of financial distress from developers, but there had been an increasing number of projects put on hold, particularly in areas where there were concerns about potential oversupply. Conditions in the established housing market more generally had eased in recent months. Housing prices had declined a little from September 2015 and auction clearance rates had fallen from very high levels to around their long-run averages. ", " Housing credit growth overall had stabilised at around 7½ per cent, following a period of rising growth since late 2012. Growth in credit to investors in housing had declined, offset by an increase in growth in credit to owner-occupiers. This was consistent with the larger increase in mortgage rates for investors and the strengthening of banks' non-price lending terms in response to earlier supervisory actions. ", " As expected, mining investment had fallen sharply in the September quarter and further large falls were anticipated. Members noted that the largest subtraction from GDP growth from falling mining investment (net of imports) was expected to occur in 2015/16. Resource export volumes had continued to rise over 2015 as more projects reached completion. Iron ore exports, particularly to China, had remained at a high level and were expected to continue to make a positive contribution to GDP growth over the forecast period. The ramp-up in LNG exports was expected to gain pace over the course of 2016, although some projects had experienced delays in bringing production on line. The scope for additional growth in coal exports appeared limited, given the low level of coal prices. Meanwhile, net service exports had risen further in response to the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate and were expected to continue supporting GDP growth over the forecast period. ", " The forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised down a little as a result of lower commodity prices over recent months. Members recognised that the outlook for commodity prices and the domestic terms of trade would depend on the outlook for the Chinese construction and industrial sectors – and global industrial activity more generally – and on the responsiveness of the supply of commodities to the decline in prices seen to date. Oil prices had fallen markedly over recent months in response to further increases in supply, though weaker demand was likely to have had some effect as well. Current low oil prices were having a marked effect on capital investment across the industry, particularly in countries with high production costs. Members noted that further increases in supply were expected over time from countries such as Iran, but that lower prices were likely to put more pressure on higher-cost producers. ", " Non-mining investment had been little changed over the previous year. Indicators of future non-residential building activity, including the stock of work yet-to-be-done and private non-residential building approvals, had declined to relatively low levels. In contrast, survey measures of non-mining business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained above their long-run average levels and growth in business credit had picked up over 2015. Non-mining business investment was forecast to pick up in the second half of the forecast period, reflecting the increase in domestic demand and competitiveness from the depreciation of the exchange rate to date. ", " Members noted that underlying inflation had increased to around ½ per cent in the December quarter, to be about 2 per cent in year-ended terms, which was much as had been expected. The consumer price index (CPI) had increased by 0.4 per cent (in seasonally adjusted terms) in the December quarter, following the low outcome in the previous quarter, to be 1.7 per cent higher over 2015. This relatively low annual rate partly reflected lower fuel prices as well as the decline in some utilities prices in the September quarter. ", " Non-tradables inflation (excluding utilities) edged down in the December quarter to be below its inflation-targeting average in year-ended terms. Inflation in new dwelling costs had eased over the past couple of quarters, from its very strong pace in early 2015. The general decline in domestic inflationary pressures was consistent with heightened competitive pressures, declines in the cost of business inputs, such as fuel and some regulated utilities, and low wage growth owing to spare capacity in the labour market. ", " The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) increased in the December quarter to be slightly higher over the year. Members noted that, although the depreciation of the exchange rate had been passed through to the prices of imports ‘across the docks’, the prices of consumer durables in the CPI had risen by less than expected from historical experience. One explanation was that upward pressure from the depreciation of the exchange rate had been offset over recent quarters by heightened competitive pressures, including from new entrants in some parts of the retail sector. Nevertheless, gradual pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation was expected to place further upward pressure on the prices of tradable items over the next few years. ", " Members noted that the forecast for GDP growth was little changed compared with the usual range of uncertainty. The forecast for the unemployment rate had been lowered, consistent with the recent unanticipated strength in the labour market, yet the level of the unemployment rate and the prevalence of low wage growth suggested that there was still spare capacity in the labour market. Members noted that the strength of employment over the past year in conjunction with below-average GDP growth created some uncertainty about the outlook for the labour market. Underlying inflation was forecast to remain low over the forecast period, underpinned by the expectation that domestic inflationary pressures would remain subdued, although the effects of the exchange rate depreciation on consumer prices would exert some upward pressure on inflation. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that growth in Australia's major trading partners had been a bit below its decade average over 2015 and was expected to remain around this pace over the forecast period. The US, Japanese and euro area economies had continued to expand over 2015, while growth in the rest of Asia, most notably China, had slowed. Growth in global industrial production and trade volumes had generally been weak, although services-sector activity had been more resilient. Lower oil prices and accommodative monetary policies in most economies were expected to continue supporting global growth. Globally, inflation had remained low and well below most central banks' targets. ", " As had been the case for some time, growth in China was expected to ease further over the forecast period. To date, the moderation of growth had largely been the result of lower investment growth as a consequence of excess capacity in heavy industry and the large stock of unsold housing, while activity in the services sector had been relatively resilient. However, a range of longer-term structural factors, such as declining growth in productivity and in the urban working-age population, were also playing a role. Although deflationary pressures persisted in the industrial sector, housing prices had increased slightly over the past year, largely owing to increases in the larger cities. Members noted that the potential interaction between slowing growth, low inflation and high – and increasing – levels of debt was an important source of uncertainty around the outlook for the Chinese economy. Members agreed that the authorities still had scope to respond if the economy turned out to be much weaker than expected. However, any sharp slowing in economic activity in China could spill over to other economies in the region and adversely affect commodity prices, including those that are important for Australia. ", " Industrial activity and exports in Japan and the rest of the east Asian region had been subdued, in part reflecting the region's exposure to the Chinese economy. As a result, GDP growth was expected to be below its decade average in the rest of east Asia in 2015. Members noted that Japanese and euro area GDP had only recently returned to 2008 levels. In contrast, the US economy had been growing at an above-trend pace for some time, which had contributed to the significant decline in the US unemployment rate. Private consumption had been the key driver of expenditure growth in the United States, supported by improvements in the labour market and lower oil prices. Overall business conditions and activity had been generally positive, although the industries most exposed to oil prices and the appreciation of the exchange rate had experienced subdued conditions. Members observed that unemployment rates had also declined in Japan and the euro area. While nominal wage growth remained low in most economies, according to some measures it had risen in both the United States and Japan. In the three large advanced economies, inflation remained low. "], "Financial Markets": [" The first tightening of US monetary policy in nearly 10 years and a further easing of monetary policy in the euro area and Japan had taken place since the previous meeting. Members noted that, although the tightening of US monetary policy was widely expected and absorbed by markets, including in emerging economies, the divergence in monetary policy between the United States, on the one hand, and the euro area and Japan, on the other, had continued to influence exchange rates. ", " In December, the Federal Open Market Committee had projected around 100 basis points of tightening during 2016, but at that time market pricing embodied only 50 basis points and since then expectations had been scaled back further, with markets currently not pricing in any further increase until the end of 2016. ", " The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a package of measures in December to ease policy further, including lowering the interest rate on its deposit facility to ‒30 basis points, citing concerns about the downside risks to the inflation outlook. The package of measures was, however, less stimulatory than markets had expected, which led to a sharp appreciation of the euro. The ECB had subsequently indicated that there was a possibility of further stimulus being announced at its next meeting in March, and markets had priced in another cut in the deposit rate at that time. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) surprised markets in late January with a reduction in the rate of interest on marginal reserves to −10 basis points, the first time this rate had been negative. The introduction of a new tiered system of interest rates was designed to minimise the effect of negative interest rates on the banking system. The current pace of balance sheet expansion by the BoJ was expected to continue over 2016, with total assets projected to equal around 90 per cent of GDP by the end of the year. Japanese government bond yields fell sharply after the monetary policy announcement by the BoJ, reaching a new low of 5 basis points. ", " Members noted that there was little volatility in financial markets immediately following the much-anticipated increase in the federal funds rate. Sentiment deteriorated early in the new year as concerns about China intensified and there were renewed declines in oil prices. These developments contributed to sharp declines in equity and corporate bond prices, declines in sovereign bond yields and depreciations of the currencies of a range of commodity exporters. Spreads on non-investment grade corporate bonds issued by energy and other resource-related companies increased sharply following the falls in oil and other commodity prices. ", " One aspect of market concern was uncertainty about the Chinese authorities' intentions for the future value of the renminbi, which had depreciated against the US dollar but had remained relatively stable in trade-weighted terms over the past year. Large capital outflows from China and the associated significant decline in Chinese foreign exchange reserves in the past few months, as well as asset sales by the sovereign wealth funds of oil-producing nations, appeared to have contributed to market volatility. Members noted the challenges for the Chinese authorities in managing the exchange rate in the face of depreciation pressure from private capital outflows. ", " Global share prices fell by almost 10 per cent over January, with a strong correlation with the fall in oil prices. Chinese equity markets fell particularly sharply amid uncertainty about the economic outlook and the possible policy reactions of the authorities. Australian equity prices also fell, although not to the same extent as overseas markets, with prices of resources sector shares having fully retraced all the gains relative to other sectors of the market over the past decade and a half. There was a small fall in Australian equity prices over 2015. ", " In foreign exchange markets, sizeable movements in exchange rates had been prompted by the deterioration in risk sentiment and divergence in monetary policy stances in the major economies. There had been a significant depreciation of the yen following the policy announcement by the BoJ. The currencies of most Asian and Latin American emerging market economies had continued to depreciate over the past couple of months. The Australian dollar had depreciated slightly against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the previous two months. ", " Funding costs for Australian banks had increased a little from their low levels recently, reflecting higher short-term wholesale funding costs both in offshore and domestic markets. The cost of new long-term wholesale funding had also increased, but remained below the cost of maturing debt. Members noted that an important issue was the extent to which higher wholesale funding costs led to a rise in deposit rates. ", " Domestically, members noted that pricing in financial markets indicated that there was no expectation of a change in the cash rate at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that recent domestic data had, on balance, been positive and judged that there were reasonable prospects for growth to increase gradually over the forecast period while maintaining inflation close to target. Employment growth over 2015 had been stronger than earlier expected and the starting point for the forecast for the unemployment rate was around ½ percentage point lower. Inflation continued to be relatively low, with underlying measures of inflation at about 2 per cent over 2015. Growth in labour costs also remained quite subdued. ", " There continued to be evidence that very low interest rates were supporting growth in household consumption and dwelling investment and that the depreciation of the exchange rate was boosting demand for domestic production as it adjusted to the evolving economic outlook. Resource exports had continued to make a significant contribution to growth. Although commodity prices and mining investment had fallen further, the drag on GDP growth from this source was expected to lessen a little over 2016/17. Members observed that leading indicators of investment intentions had continued to suggest that there was little prospect for a pick-up in non-mining business investment in the near term, although surveys of business conditions were at above-average levels and the pace of lending to businesses had picked up. Credit growth to households remained at a moderate pace, albeit with a change in composition between investors and owner-occupiers, following supervisory changes to emphasise prudent lending standards. ", " Data on international economic conditions suggested that growth in Australia's major trading partners was likely to be sustained around its current pace. The recent increase in financial market volatility owed in part to uncertainty about the outlook for global economic growth, particularly China, much of which arose from concerns about the capacity of policymakers to respond effectively to the array of challenges they faced. Members noted that global growth would be supported by accommodative monetary policies and lower oil prices, but that inflation generally continued to be lower than central banks' targets. In addition, funding costs for high-quality borrowers remained very low. ", " Based on the available data and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation, members judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged at an accommodative setting. Over the period ahead, new information would enable the Board to assess whether the recent improvement in labour market conditions was continuing and whether recent financial market turbulence presaged weaker global and domestic demand. The Board noted that the outlook for continued low inflation may provide scope for easier monetary policy, should that be appropriate to lend further support to demand.

Growth in household consumption and dwelling investment had been strong in the quarter, while net exports had been little changed and business investment had subtracted from growth. Including upward revisions for the September quarter meant that GDP had grown by 3.0 per cent over 2015, which was stronger than forecast in February. Members noted that this outcome was broadly consistent with the improvement in the labour market observed over 2015. More recent data had suggested that the Australian economy had continued to grow at a moderate pace in early 2016 and that activity had continued to rebalance towards the non-mining sectors of the economy. ", "  Members noted that growth in household consumption had picked up in the second half of 2015, supported by low interest rates and strong employment growth and despite further subdued growth in household income. The household saving ratio had been on a gradual downward trend over the previous few years. While retail sales growth had recorded little change in February, liaison had reported that trading conditions remained generally favourable and surveys of households' perceptions of their own finances remained above average. ", "  Dwelling investment, particularly in the high-density sector, had risen strongly in the December quarter. Although residential dwelling approvals had declined over the past year or so, a sizeable pipeline of work yet to be done was expected to support dwelling investment in the period ahead. Conditions in the established housing market had moderated over the past six months, with aggregate measures of year-ended housing price growth continuing to ease. Members noted that the easing in growth in apartment prices was consistent with the recent strong increase in supply and that there continued to be significant differences in demand conditions across the country; conditions had been relatively strong in the detached housing markets of Sydney and Melbourne and relatively weak in Perth. Housing credit growth had moderated a little over recent months to be close to 7 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms, after rising through to mid 2015. ", "  The decline in business investment in the December quarter had been broadly in line with expectations. Mining investment had fallen to around 4 per cent of nominal GDP from a peak of 8 per cent in 2012. Members noted that the recent rebound in commodity prices, even if sustained, was unlikely to lead to any material change in mining investment over the next couple of years. The December quarter national accounts also indicated that non-mining business investment had been little changed for several years. Nevertheless, surveys of business conditions had remained above average in recent months, consistent with the slight increase in non-mining profits (as a share of GDP) recorded in the national accounts, and business credit had continued to show strength, growing at over 8 per cent in six-month annualised terms in February. Members noted that employment growth in non-mining sectors of the economy had been relatively strong and that there was evidence that non-mining business investment had increased over the previous financial year in New South Wales and Victoria. Non-mining investment had fallen sharply in Western Australia, which suggested that the decline in commodity prices and mining investment had been adversely affecting non-mining business conditions and investment in that state. ", "  Both export and import volumes had increased modestly in the December quarter. Over the year, resource exports had been increasing as projects were completed and production capacity increased. Much of this growth had been driven by liquefied natural gas projects and members noted that this was likely to remain the case over the next couple of years. Growth in net service exports, which was consistent with the pronounced increase in short-term visitor arrivals, had contributed around ½ percentage point to growth over 2015. Members observed that this component of GDP was one of the most sensitive to changes in the exchange rate and discussed the impact of exchange rate movements on the economy more broadly. ", "  Following stronger-than-expected outcomes in the latter part of 2015, the level of employment had been little changed over the three months to February. In the month of February, the participation rate had declined a little and the unemployment rate had fallen back to 5.8 per cent. Members observed that month-to-month volatility in the labour force data was not unusual and that, overall, the labour market was noticeably stronger than a year earlier: employment growth had remained a little above average, the unemployment rate had been on a downward trend since around mid 2015 and the participation rate had been on an upward trend. Leading indicators of employment growth had been mixed of late; job advertisements had levelled out in recent months after a period of relatively consistent increases, while job vacancies reported by businesses had continued to increase. ", "  Labour cost pressures had remained subdued across a range of measures. The most recent data on enterprise agreements and the national accounts measure of average earnings per hour had confirmed the low growth of wages that was already apparent in the wage price index. Nominal unit labour costs had been unchanged for over four years, as growth in employee earnings had broadly matched growth in labour productivity. Members noted that subdued labour cost growth had led to low household income growth, but had also enabled businesses to increase employment by more than might have been the case otherwise. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Indicators of global economic activity had eased a little over recent months, but were still consistent with growth in Australia's major trading partners remaining at a slightly below-average pace in the March quarter. Survey indicators had suggested that activity in the service sectors in a range of economies had moderated since late 2015 and that conditions in the manufacturing sector globally had remained subdued in early 2016. Global industrial production and trade volumes had been little changed over the past year. Members observed that these measures had been particularly weak for the Asian region. Meanwhile, growth in several advanced economies had led to a further decline in unemployment rates over that period. ", "  In China, the pace of overall growth in the first two months of the year appeared to have been broadly unchanged from the end of 2015, although the data were affected by the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday period. While growth in industrial production had been relatively stable, there had been a large decline in the production of crude steel and steel products. Nonetheless, imports of iron ore (including from Australia) had remained at a high level, consistent with the lower level of Chinese iron ore production following declines over 2015. The GDP growth target for 2016 had been lowered at the recent meeting of the National People's Congress to 6.5–7 per cent from ‘around 7 per cent’ in 2015. There had been acknowledgement that achieving this target would require some additional support from fiscal and financial policy. Members noted that the pick-up in growth in total social financing in China since the first half of 2015 was consistent with the authorities' willingness to support growth in economic activity. ", "  Expectations of more policy stimulus in China in the near term appeared to have contributed to increases in iron ore and steel prices, both of which have risen substantially from their lows around the turn of the year. Members noted that this would imply a modest near-term rise in Australia's terms of trade, should current levels of commodity prices be sustained. However, at the same time, Chinese steel production had declined further and the global supply of iron ore was expected to increase as new mines ramped up production during 2016. ", "  Although inflation in most advanced economies had increased since reaching a low point in 2015, inflation rates had remained below central bank targets. In Japan, despite relatively tight labour market conditions, wage growth was expected to decline a little in the year ahead based on the outcome of recent wage negotiations between unions and large employers. Ongoing weakness in output growth and lower oil prices had led the Bank of Japan to revise down its forecast for headline inflation in 2016 and push out the point at which inflation is expected to reach the target. Although the euro area economy appeared to have experienced further modest growth in the March quarter and the labour market had continued to improve, inflation remained little changed over recent months at rates below the European Central Bank's (ECB) target. ECB staff had downgraded their forecasts for GDP growth and inflation, noting weakening global growth (particularly among emerging market economies) and the appreciation of the euro, and did not expect inflation to return to the target until after 2018. In contrast, measures of year-ended headline and core inflation in the United States had picked up in recent months. ", "  GDP growth in the United States had continued to be driven by consumption, supported by strong employment growth, lower fuel prices and increasing household wealth. Notwithstanding these developments, the US Federal Reserve left its forecasts for inflation and GDP little changed, citing concerns about global economic and financial market developments over recent months. "], "Financial Markets": ["  Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by observing that sentiment in global markets had improved over the past month. This had been reflected in a rise in equity prices and a narrowing of spreads between yields on riskier debt and US sovereign debt. ", "  In terms of monetary policy, the ECB had eased policy further at its March meeting. In addition to making small reductions in its policy rates, the size of the ECB's monthly asset purchases had been increased and eligibility had been widened to include investment-grade corporate bonds. Targeted long-term refinancing operations had also been re-introduced and refined: banks would be able to borrow from the ECB for four years at an interest rate around zero at the time of the loan being extended, which would become negative if certain benchmarks for lending to the private sector were met. Members noted that these operations were expected to result in a significant increase in the size of the ECB's balance sheet over the next year or so, depending on the take-up of the operations by banks. ", "  The US Federal Reserve left its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at its March meeting and revised down the projected path of policy tightening in 2016. Market-implied expectations were for an even slower pace of tightening, with the next policy rate increase not expected until early 2017. ", "  The US dollar depreciated on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, particularly following the downward revision of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy rate expectations. Members noted that the US dollar was now lower than at the time of the first increase in the federal funds rate last December. ", "  In trade-weighted terms, the renminbi had depreciated a little further over the past month to be 6 per cent below its peak in August 2015. Capital outflows from China had been smaller in February than in recent months, reflecting, in part, a tightening of some capital controls and reduced expectations of exchange rate depreciation. Consistent with the smaller capital outflows, Chinese foreign currency reserves declined by a smaller amount than in recent months. Most other Asian and emerging market currencies had appreciated markedly against the US dollar over the past month. ", "  The Australian dollar had appreciated by almost 7 per cent against the US dollar over the past month. It had appreciated by 4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis, reflecting stronger domestic economic data, the rise in commodity prices and the fact that the renminbi (which has the highest weight in the trade-weighted basket) had depreciated by only slightly less against the Australian dollar than had the US dollar. At the time of the meeting, the Australian dollar was around its highest level since mid 2015. ", "  Yields on US and German sovereign bonds were little changed over the past month, while yields on Japanese government bonds fell further, with almost two-thirds of these now trading at yields below zero. Australian government bond yields moved broadly in line with yields on US sovereign bonds. Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt and corporate bonds narrowed, particularly for commodity-producing countries and corporations. ", "  Global share prices rose significantly over the past month. The share prices of US banks had retraced around half of their sharp falls earlier in the year. European bank share prices rose following the ECB's policy announcement, as some of the measures were assessed as beneficial to bank profitability. Australian equity prices rose by less than the increases observed in other developed markets, in part because there was a smaller rebound in bank share prices given concerns about loan provisioning. ", "  Domestically, bond issuance by Australian banks had been very solid over the past year, with the March quarter the strongest in six years. Members noted that modest rises in some small business lending rates had been announced by the major banks since the previous meeting. Lending rates to this category of borrowers remained very low. Lending rates for large businesses had been little changed. ", "  Members noted that no change in the cash rate was expected at the current meeting. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", "  While markets had experienced further bouts of volatility, notably in the early part of the year, underlying risk factors had tended to evolve more gradually. In China, the slowing pace of economic growth, the large run-up in debt and deteriorating loan quality had prompted concerns over downside risks to its financial system. Similar concerns applied to some other emerging market economies, especially those most exposed to the large declines in global commodity prices and where corporate sector leverage had increased the most. Risks also remained elevated in some advanced economies, particularly Japan and Europe, where prospects for the banking sectors had been marked down from already weak starting points. However, these external developments had not significantly affected Australia's financial system. Members observed that Australian banks' direct exposures to China and other emerging markets were small. They also discussed the larger exposures of Australian banks to the housing and dairy sectors in New Zealand. ", "  Domestic financial risks had shifted over the past six months from housing lending towards residential development and some other commercial property markets. Members noted that the actions of regulators since late 2014 had helped induce a tightening of banks' housing lending standards. In particular, the share of high loan-to-valuation lending had taken a noticeable step down and tighter serviceability metrics had reduced maximum loan sizes. Housing market conditions had also moderated. These developments had generally enhanced resilience in the household sector, but could cause issues for developers of some apartment projects if demand for their product were to slow significantly. ", "  Some other commercial property markets had also been adjusting with a lag to a slowing in demand. Office vacancy rates in the resource-intensive states remained very high as further new supply continued to come on line. Commercial property yields more broadly were being compressed across a range of market segments. In the rest of the business sector, the balance sheets of some resource-related companies had come under strain following the large falls in global commodity prices over recent years. In contrast, the non-resources business sector generally showed little sign of financial difficulties. ", "  Members observed that Australian-based banks had also taken steps to increase their resilience to domestic risks. As well as changing their housing lending standards, they had tightened the availability of finance to some parts of the property sector and increased capital levels substantially. Profitability had remained high. Banks' non-performing loans remained low overall; while they had picked up for resources-related lending, banks' exposures to this sector and mining services firms were small, although some foreign banks operating in Australia had much higher exposure shares. Members nonetheless observed that as banks competed for lending in a narrower range of markets, it would be important that serviceability and other lending standards remained appropriate. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that there had been some easing in the growth of global economic activity, particularly in emerging markets, although growth in several advanced economies had led to a further decline in unemployment rates over the past year. In aggregate, the outlook was for growth in Australia's major trading partners to remain a little below average, as previously forecast. Globally, inflation had remained low and very easy monetary policies were continuing to provide support to global demand. ", "  Oil and iron ore prices had risen noticeably since earlier in the year. The rise in commodity prices had been accompanied by an appreciation of the Australian dollar, which also partly reflected the expectation that US monetary policy would be more accommodative over the coming year than had been anticipated earlier. Members noted that an appreciating exchange rate could complicate progress in activity rebalancing towards the non-mining sectors of the economy. ", "  Domestically, the latest national accounts data suggested that the economy grew at a moderate pace in the December quarter and more recent data were consistent with this having continued in early 2016. Over 2015, GDP growth was higher than earlier forecast, which went some way towards reconciling the strength in a range of labour market indicators over that period. Although employment had been little changed over recent months, some slowing was to be expected following the strong gains recorded in the December quarter and the unemployment rate was lower than it was around the middle of 2015. On all measures, wage growth remained at quite low levels and domestic cost pressures, more generally, remained subdued. Combined with the appreciation of the exchange rate and the low level of inflation globally, this suggested that inflation in Australia was likely to remain low over the next year or two. ", "  Given these conditions, members assessed that it was appropriate for monetary policy to be very accommodative. Low interest rates had played an important role in promoting the gradual increase in consumption growth and activity in the housing market. Conditions in the established housing market appeared to have moderated over the past year, in part reflecting the effect of supervisory measures designed to emphasise prudent lending standards and contain risks in the housing market. Housing credit growth had moderated a little over recent months and there had been a change in the composition of lending between investors and owner-occupiers. ", "  Members judged that there were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the economy, with inflation close to target. The Board therefore decided that the current setting of monetary policy remained appropriate. New information would allow the Board to reassess the outlook for inflation and decide whether the improvement in labour market conditions evident last year was continuing. Continued low inflation would provide scope to ease monetary policy further, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 3 May 2016"], "Text": {"Others Present": ["Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department)", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary)"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members began their discussion of the Australian economy by discussing the March quarter consumer price index (CPI). They noted that inflation had been lower than expected. Various measures suggested that underlying inflation had declined to a little less than ¼ per cent, compared with about ½ per cent in the December quarter, to be about 1½ per cent over the year. Headline inflation had been lower still, partly reflecting a decline in fuel prices in the March quarter and over the year. Even so, the CPI data had indicated that weakness in domestic cost pressures had been broadly based. Non-tradables inflation had declined further in March to around its lowest year-ended rate since the late 1990s, reflecting low growth in labour costs and a range of other factors, including heightened retail competition, a moderation in conditions in housing rental and construction markets, and declines in the cost of business inputs such as fuel and utilities. The exchange rate depreciation over the preceding few years had continued to place some upward pressure on the prices of tradable items, although low wage growth and heightened retail competition appeared to have limited the extent to which higher import prices had become evident in retail prices. The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) were little changed in the March quarter.", " Members discussed the extent to which the CPI data provided a signal about ongoing inflation trends. They noted that CPI data were less subject to measurement error than many other key data series. Moreover, the lower-than-expected CPI outcome could not be explained entirely by temporary factors and in fact was significantly driven by low price rises for non-tradable items. That in turn was consistent with a range of data suggesting quite subdued growth in labour costs (which had also been a bit weaker over 2015 than previously expected).", " In their consideration of the outlook, members noted that the staff forecasts for inflation had been lowered. The forecasts embodied the expectation that growth in the wage price index would stabilise around current quarterly growth rates before gradually picking up later in the forecast period. This pick-up was consistent with the outlook for output growth and expected improvements in labour market conditions. In addition, information from the Bank's business liaison suggested that firms generally had been unwilling to make offers of wage growth below 2 per cent. But if inflation was to be persistently lower than previously forecast, it was possible that, in time, this could be reflected in lower wage growth.", " Members noted that wage growth had also been low in many advanced economies, even in cases where labour market conditions had become quite tight. This suggested that some of the factors that might explain these outcomes, such as heightened job insecurity, may be relevant to the current Australian experience. On the other hand, given the apparent flexibility of the Australian labour market over recent years, members noted the possibility that labour cost growth could pick up sooner or by more than expected as labour market conditions improved.", " Employment growth had slowed in the first quarter of 2016, although members noted that it had remained stronger than population growth over the past year. Leading indicators of employment had been somewhat mixed: job vacancies reported by businesses had continued to rise, while job advertisements had been broadly flat over recent months. These indicators, along with the outlook for output growth, suggested that employment would continue to grow, but at a somewhat slower pace than had been evident over the previous year. The unemployment rate had been around 5¾ per cent in recent months and was expected to remain around this level over the next year or so before gradually declining over the forecast period, as output growth increased. The outlook for the unemployment rate was broadly in line with the forecasts presented three months earlier and consistent with spare capacity remaining in the labour market throughout the forecast period.", " Members noted that there had been no material change to the forecasts for growth in the Australian economy, although the unexpected strength recorded in the latter part of 2015 had led to an upward revision to year-ended GDP growth in the near term. The effects of low interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since early 2013 were expected to lead to a gradual strengthening of growth to an above-trend rate and help a further rebalancing of activity towards the non-resources sectors of the economy.", " Growth in household consumption had increased in the second half of 2015. While the pace of growth in retail sales volumes looked to have been maintained early in 2016, other timely indicators of consumption had eased a little in recent months. Information from the Bank's liaison with retailers suggested some moderation in trading conditions in 2016, although conditions had remained generally positive. Households' perceptions of their own finances had declined to around average levels in April, after being above average for most of the past year or so. However, these indicators provided only a rough guide to quarterly growth in consumption, which was forecast to be slightly above average even though real household disposable income had been revised lower, consistent with revisions to wage growth. As a result, the household saving ratio was expected to continue to decline gradually.", " The amount of residential construction work still in the pipeline was substantial and had increased further of late. This pointed to further strong growth in dwelling investment, albeit at a gradually declining rate consistent with the decline in building approvals over the previous year. Conditions in established housing markets had stabilised over the past six months or so. Housing prices had grown moderately over 2016, following a small decline at the end of 2015. Housing credit growth had eased a little to around 7 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms in early 2016. This had followed increases in mortgage rates and the strengthening of banks' non-price lending terms in response to supervisory actions.", " Surveyed conditions in the business sector had remained above average and growth in business credit had increased over the past year or so. Indicators of investment intentions remained weak; for instance, the stock of private non-residential work yet to be done had fallen further in the December quarter, in line with subdued levels of non-residential building approvals. This suggested that non-mining business investment was likely to remain subdued for a time, although it was forecast gradually to pick up later in the forecast period as overall demand strengthened further. Mining investment was expected to continue to fall as projects were progressively completed, although the magnitude of the falls was expected to diminish over the next couple of years, consistent with the forecasts presented in the February <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. Members noted that the recent rally in commodity prices was not expected to boost mining investment over the next couple of years. Project completions were expected to support further growth in resource exports, particularly iron ore and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The contribution of net service exports to growth was expected to continue to be positive given the exchange rate depreciation since 2013."], "International Economic Conditions": ["Recent data indicated that growth in Australia's major trading partners had eased around the turn of the year to be somewhat below its decade average in the early part of 2016. The outlook for growth in major trading partners in 2016 and 2017 had been revised a little lower since the February <em>Statement</em> <em>on Monetary Policy </em>to reflect these data as well as some reassessment of the momentum of growth, particularly in Asia. Growth in major trading partners was expected to be supported by accommodative monetary policies, while fiscal policies were expected to be less of a drag on growth in the major advanced economies. Core inflation had increased in many advanced economies since mid 2015, but members noted that inflation had remained low globally and was lower than central banks' targets in most economies.", " Growth in the Chinese economy had moderated further in the March quarter. Subdued investment in the manufacturing sector had been offset to some extent by rising public infrastructure investment and renewed growth in real estate investment. The latter was consistent with strength in the Chinese residential property market following earlier government measures designed to stimulate demand. Chinese trade volumes had declined further, which had had flow-on effects to other Asian economies and emerging economies in other regions with strong trade links to China. There had been some indications that slowing employment growth in the high-income economies of east Asia might lead to a slowing in consumption growth in these economies.", " The outlook for the Chinese economy had continued to be a key issue. Despite the moderation in growth in the March quarter, the outlook there was similar to that forecast previously, based on the expectation of further support being provided from more stimulatory policy settings. The Chinese authorities appeared, at present, to be giving greater priority to short-term growth objectives over longer-term goals of deleveraging and encouraging growth that was less reliant on investment and heavy industry. However, members noted that the pursuit of near-term growth targets was likely to increase the already elevated levels of debt and could delay addressing the problem of excess capacity in the manufacturing and resources sectors. Therefore, these actions might adversely affect financial stability and the economic outlook in China more broadly in the medium term.", " The available data suggested that growth in the United States had eased in the first quarter, partly owing to weakness in private investment in the oil sector. Other components of US domestic demand had been more resilient, supported by very expansionary monetary policy, strong employment growth and increasing household wealth. In contrast, Japanese GDP was likely to have remained little changed in the March quarter. The euro area economy had continued to grow at an above-trend pace, driven by domestic demand.", " Although labour markets had shown further improvement across most advanced economies, wage growth had thus far remained subdued. There had been signs of labour cost pressures building and core inflation increasing in the United States and the United Kingdom, where unemployment rates were close to levels typically associated with a pick-up in inflationary pressures. But wage growth had moderated in Japan, despite the unemployment rate being around a 20-year low. Members noted that there was significant uncertainty about the timing and extent of the pick-up in wage growth and inflation that could be expected as labour markets tightened further in the advanced economies. Any changes in expectations about inflationary pressures would have implications for the expected path of monetary policy and consequently exchange rates, which continued to be an important source of uncertainty in the forecasts.", " Despite the moderation in major trading partner growth in early 2016, members noted that there had been a further sizeable increase in commodity prices, particularly for iron ore, coking coal and oil. The rise in the prices of bulk commodities had followed the announcement of China's 2016 target for output growth and an expectation that this would be achieved through more stimulatory policy settings. The price of iron ore had increased by 80 per cent from its low point at the end of 2015, but was still only around one-third of its peak level five years earlier. The forecasts assumed that these higher prices of bulk commodities would not be sustained. Demand for steel in China was still expected to decline over the next couple of years and a substantial amount of new, low-cost iron ore supply was likely to enter the market over that period. The price of oil had increased by around 70 per cent since recent lows and this had occurred alongside ongoing speculation about potential caps to OPEC production and signs that oil production in the United States was likely to decline. This had led to an upward revision to LNG prices. The net result of these various movements was that Australia's terms of trade would be slightly higher than previously expected in the near term and were assumed to remain close to recent levels – which were 35 per cent below the recent peak – over the forecast period. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that sentiment had continued to improve.", " Looking at monetary policy settings of the major central banks, members noted that the Bank of Japan had not changed policy at its meeting in the preceding week, notwithstanding market expectations that policy would be eased further. The yen had appreciated sharply following the announcement and was around 12 per cent higher against the US dollar since the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rates at the end of January. Participants in Japanese financial markets were continuing to adjust to the new regime of negative interest rates amid occasional signs of market dysfunction.", " The US Federal Reserve's policy settings were left unchanged at the April meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, as had been expected by market participants. Market pricing implied that there would be, at most, one 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate during 2016. The European Central Bank had also left its policy settings unchanged in April.", " Sovereign bond yields, including in Australia, were little changed in April. In most of the major markets, bond yields had remained close to historic lows.", " Members noted that the finances of the Greek Government were likely to come under greater scrutiny in the period ahead. With sizeable debt repayments due around the middle of the year, the Greek Government was negotiating with its official sector creditors about new funding. In contrast, Argentina had issued its first bond since the default in 2001, having reached agreement with its holdout creditors.", " In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had continued to depreciate gradually, with a cumulative depreciation of about 6 per cent since mid January. The Chinese renminbi had also continued to edge lower; the effective exchange rate had depreciated partly because of the appreciation of the yen, which has a significant weight in China's trade-weighted basket. Members noted there was evidence that capital outflows from China had abated in recent months. The Australian dollar appreciated during the first part of the month following the rise in commodity prices, before depreciating sharply following the release of the March quarter CPI data.", " Higher commodity prices – in particular, the increase in oil prices – had boosted global equity markets, with many equity markets recovering their losses from earlier in the year. A notable exception was Japan, where the market was more than 15 per cent lower. In the Australian market, there had been large rises in the share prices of resource companies over the past month.", " Bond issuance by the Australian banks thus far in 2016 had been towards the upper end of the range for recent years in both gross and net terms, but wholesale debt costs had not increased significantly overall.", " In the domestic market, following the release of the CPI, expectations of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting had increased sharply to be around a 50-50 proposition."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the recent data on inflation and labour costs had been lower than expected at the time of the February <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. Although the March quarter outcome for the CPI reflected some temporary factors, the broad-based softness in prices and labour costs signalled less momentum in domestic inflationary pressures than had previously been expected. As a result, there had been a downward revision to the inflation outlook and the profile for wage growth. Underlying inflation was expected to remain around 1–2 per cent over 2016 and to pick up to 1½–2½ per cent by mid 2018.", " The recent data suggested that growth in Australia's major trading partners was likely to be a little softer than previously expected and below its decade average in 2016 and 2017. While growth in the Chinese economy had continued to slow, the growth outlook had remained much as previously forecast based on the expectation of further support being provided by more stimulatory policy settings. The renewed focus of the Chinese authorities on the short-term growth targets had been accompanied by a strong rally in bulk commodity prices over recent months. Higher commodity prices would typically support incomes and activity in Australia. However, the rally in commodity prices was not expected to boost mining investment over the next couple of years.", " Sentiment in financial markets had improved following a period of heightened volatility earlier in the year. Despite uncertainty about the global economic outlook and policy settings among the major jurisdictions, funding costs for high-quality borrowers remained very low and, globally, monetary policy was remarkably accommodative.", " Domestically, the outlook for economic activity and unemployment had been little changed from that presented three months earlier. The available data suggested that the economy had continued to rebalance following the mining investment boom, supported by very accommodative monetary policy and the depreciation of the exchange rate since early 2013, which had helped the traded sector. GDP growth overall had been a bit stronger than expected over 2015, but appeared to have been sustained at a more moderate pace since then. Growth was forecast to pick up gradually to be above estimates of potential growth later in the forecast period. Accordingly, the unemployment rate was expected to remain around current levels for a time before declining gradually as GDP growth picked up. The exchange rate depreciation since early 2013 was assisting with growth and the economic adjustment process, although an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.", " In coming to their policy decision, members noted that developments over recent months had not led to a material change in the outlook for economic activity or the unemployment rate, but the outlook for inflation had been revised lower. At the same time, they took careful note of developments in the housing market, which indicated that supervisory measures were strengthening lending standards and that the potential risks of lowering interest rates therefore were less than they had been a year earlier.

", " The most noteworthy developments that had persisted beyond the volatility immediately surrounding the UK referendum were the depreciation of the pound, the appreciation of the yen and the decline in bond yields to historic lows in a number of major markets as well as in Australia. Sovereign yields in the United Kingdom had declined considerably, notwithstanding the UK's credit rating being downgraded. Members noted that a sizeable share of the global sovereign bond market was trading at negative rates. Swiss government bond yields were negative up to a tenor of nearly 50 years. In Australia, the 10-year bond yield reached a record low of 1.95 per cent, with the decline in the yield on Friday, 24 June having been the largest daily fall since September 2001.

Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) were expected to ease monetary policy further in the near future. The ECB had commenced its corporate bond purchase program in June, as had been announced in March. ", " Following the UK referendum, the pound fell sharply to its lowest level against the US dollar in over three decades. On 24 June, the pound depreciated against the US dollar by as much as 12 per cent and recorded the largest single-day movement since the pound was floated in 1971. Throughout the day, there were large volumes traded in both directions. Members noted that, as at the time of the meeting, the pound had depreciated by 9 per cent in trade-weighted terms since the referendum but remained above the levels it had reached in 2008. ", " Over the past month as a whole, the US dollar and euro were little changed in trade-weighted terms, while the Chinese renminbi had depreciated in both trade-weighted terms and against the US dollar. A decline in the value of the People's Bank of China's foreign currency reserves in May appeared to have reflected valuation effects, but overall the value of reserves had been broadly stable over the past few months. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms over the past month, having been affected by changing expectations about the future path of monetary policy in Australia and the United States, as well as the UK referendum result. ", " Global share prices fell sharply following the UK referendum, but, with the exception of Japan and Europe, had subsequently largely recovered. Banking share prices were generally lower, particularly those of European and domestically focused UK banks. Members noted that ongoing problems in the Italian banking system had again come to the fore. In Australia, share prices had declined by around 4 per cent over the course of the 2015/16 financial year, with divergent outcomes across sectors reflecting the continued rebalancing of the economy following the mining investment boom. ", " Spreads on Australian bank debt had moved marginally higher following the UK referendum, but yields had remained at low levels. Members observed that Australian banks had issued a large amount of debt earlier in the year, limiting the need for further issuance in the near term if conditions in debt markets were unsettled. Average outstanding housing lending rates were expected to continue to edge lower as loans were refinanced following the cash rate reduction in May, although members noted that banks' serviceability requirements for borrowers had not changed. ", " Members noted that market pricing had assigned only a small chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that, while the UK referendum decision was likely to have an adverse effect on the UK economy, it was too early to gauge the size of that effect. Also, any adverse effects on growth arising from a reduction in access to EU markets and heightened political uncertainty were likely to be offset to some extent in the near term by the depreciation of the pound. In 2015, around one-half of the United Kingdom's exports (12 per cent of GDP) went to EU countries. Around one-half of these exports were services, of which around one-third were financial services. Estimates from the International Monetary Fund had suggested that in a relatively pessimistic scenario, in which output in the United Kingdom was around 5 per cent lower than otherwise over three years, global growth could average a little more than 0.1 percentage points lower over the next few years. Members noted that the direct effect on the Australian economy was likely to be quite small, given that only around 3 per cent of Australia's exports went to the United Kingdom and around 4½ per cent went to the rest of the European Union. ", " Meanwhile, growth in Australia's major trading partners looked to have remained a little below average over recent months. Growth in global industrial production had remained weak in year-ended terms, while growth in merchandise trade had picked up slightly. Inflation had generally remained below most central banks' targets, although core inflation in the major advanced economies had picked up since the previous year as labour market conditions had tightened further. Overall, commodity prices had risen over the month to be well above the low levels reached around the turn of the year. ", " GDP growth in the United States appeared to have picked up in the June quarter, after moderating in the March quarter, and the gradual recovery in the euro area looked to have continued. In both economies, activity in the March quarter had been driven by relatively strong growth in household consumption. Members noted that business investment had contributed to growth in the euro area and in the United States (excluding the energy sector). Growth in business investment in the United Kingdom had been moderating, which may have been partly related to the effect of uncertainty leading up to the UK referendum. ", " Although US employment growth had moderated in May, the unemployment rate had declined to be below estimates of its long-run equilibrium. Inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's inflation goal, although it was higher than it had been a year earlier. The unemployment rate had also declined further in the euro area, although considerable spare capacity remained. Inflation had continued to be well below the ECB's target of 2 per cent or a little below. In the United Kingdom, the unemployment rate had fallen to around long-run equilibrium levels and core inflation had been picking up. ", " Recent data suggested that economic growth in China had continued to ease. Subdued conditions in the mining and manufacturing sectors had contributed to weakness in private investment. The output of some key industrial products, including steel, had been little changed over the past year, although iron ore imports from Australia had increased further. Members noted that the general weakness in industrial activity had been partly offset by an increase in public sector spending, which had been particularly apparent in the strong growth of public infrastructure investment over the past year or so. Dwelling investment had also picked up since late 2015, following measures by the Chinese authorities to support demand for real estate. Buoyant property market conditions, particularly in some larger cities, had more recently prompted authorities in some regions to introduce measures to constrain housing demand. Total social financing flows had moderated in recent months and overall inflationary pressures remained subdued. ", " In Japan, conditions in the labour market remained tight and base wages were rising at an above-average pace. However, inflation was still below the Bank of Japan's target of 2 per cent. In the rest of east Asia, recent data pointed to a continuation of below-average growth. Economic conditions had been relatively subdued in the higher-income economies in the region, in part reflecting their greater exposure to trade. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members observed that there had been relatively little new data on the Australian economy since the previous meeting, most of which had related to labour and housing markets. Overall, the available data for the June quarter were consistent with a moderation in GDP growth following the stronger-than-expected outcome in the March quarter, mainly because there appeared to have been a smaller contribution to growth from net exports in the June quarter. Trade data suggested that iron ore export volumes had declined from very high levels in April and May, while coal export volumes had increased marginally. ", " Consumption had grown at around its decade-average rate in the March quarter. More recent indicators had been mixed. The value of retail sales had increased only slightly in April and May but liaison indicated that growth in retail sales had picked up in June, partly because cold weather had boosted clothing and apparel sales. However, liaison had also pointed to ongoing pressure to discount prices in response to increased competition in some retail markets. Meanwhile, survey measures of households' perceptions of their own finances had increased in May and June, to be clearly above average. ", " Survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained noticeably above their long-run averages in May. Members noted that these indicators were consistent with data and evidence from liaison suggesting that non-mining business investment had been growing in some parts of the economy that were less exposed to the effects of the decline in commodity prices and the fall in mining investment. Business credit growth was higher than a year earlier, despite easing a little recently. Liaison had suggested that the outlook for investment was relatively favourable in some commercial property sectors including retail, hotels, student accommodation and aged care. However, non-residential building approvals had remained at relatively low levels over the past year. ", " The unemployment rate had remained steady at around 5¾ per cent for some months, having fallen by around ½ percentage point over 2015, and the participation rate had been little changed of late. Following strong outcomes in late 2015, employment growth had moderated to be around its long-run average in year-ended terms. Over the course of 2016, employment growth had been driven by part-time jobs, while full-time employment had retraced some of its earlier strong gains. Members noted that, over the past year or so, the underemployment rate (which captures those who are employed but wanting and available to work more hours) had not fallen to the same extent as the unemployment rate. Employment growth had been relatively strong in the household services sector since the beginning of 2016 and construction employment had been rising. The forward-looking indicators of employment had been slightly weaker over recent months following gains over the preceding year, but were still consistent with employment growth in the months ahead. ", " Housing prices in June had risen moderately in Sydney but had declined in some other capital cities. This followed unusually large increases recorded in April and May, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Other indicators of housing market activity had been mixed over recent months. Auction clearance rates and sales volumes had been lower than a year earlier, although both remained a little above average. Housing credit growth had eased further, consistent with a relatively low level of turnover in the housing market and the earlier tightening in lending standards. ", " Recent indicators suggested that dwelling investment had continued to grow strongly, particularly for higher-density dwellings. Looking through the volatility of the data, building approvals were a little lower than a year earlier but remained elevated and implied a considerable amount of work yet to be done. At the same time, a number of measures were being implemented that could dampen foreign investors' demand for new dwellings. Several state governments had increased or were preparing to increase taxes on foreign investors in housing, while the major banks had increased restrictions on housing loan approvals for applicants relying on foreign income. Nationally, growth in rents had declined over the past year to low levels and the vacancy rate had increased to around its long-term average. ", " Measures of inflation expectations – from consumers, market economists, union officials and financial markets – had remained below average. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners looked to have remained slightly below average over recent months, in line with earlier forecasts. GDP growth in China appeared to have eased further, which was continuing to affect economic conditions throughout the Asian region. Monetary policy remained very accommodative across the major economies and was expected to remain so given that inflation was below most central banks' targets, despite improvements in labour markets leading to full employment in several large advanced economies. ", " The United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union had led to considerable financial market volatility, which had since settled. Financial markets had functioned effectively throughout the episode and borrowing costs for high-quality borrowers remained low. Any effects of the referendum outcome on UK and global economic activity remained to be seen. In any event, the referendum result implied a period of uncertainty about the outlook for the United Kingdom and the European Union. In the absence of significant financial dislocation, the staff's central case was that this uncertainty was expected to have only a modest adverse effect on global economic activity. ", " Commodity prices had generally increased since the previous meeting. At the time of the present meeting, the Australian dollar (in trade-weighted terms) was around the levels assumed in the forecasts at the time of the May <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. ", " In the domestic economy, the transition of economic activity to the non-resources sector was now well advanced and recent data suggested that growth had continued at a moderate pace in the June quarter. Low interest rates were continuing to support household spending and the lower exchange rate since 2013 had continued to assist the traded sector of the economy. Members noted that an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the necessary economic adjustments. ", " Recent data showed that conditions in the labour market had been more mixed of late. The unemployment rate had remained around 5¾ per cent for most of 2016, having fallen noticeably over 2015. Inflation was still expected to remain quite low for some time given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world. ", " Indicators of conditions in housing markets had been somewhat mixed over recent months. Housing prices were recorded as having risen in Sydney and Melbourne in April and May, but were little changed in June. Building approvals remained elevated at levels that would add to the considerable amount of dwelling construction work already in the pipeline. Considerable supply of apartments was scheduled to come on stream over the next few years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. At the same time, however, housing credit growth had eased, in line with a lower turnover of housing and the earlier tightening in banks' lending standards following the announcement of supervisory measures. Various state government measures and changes to bank lending requirements were likely to temper foreign investor demand for housing. ", " Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding monetary policy steady would be the most prudent course of action at this meeting. The Board noted that further information on inflationary pressures, the labour market and housing market activity would be available over the following month and that the staff would provide an update of their forecasts ahead of the August <em>Statement on Monetary Policy.</em> This information would allow the Board to refine its assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation and to make any adjustment to the stance of policy that may be appropriate.

{"Date": ["Sydney – 2 August 2016"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens AC (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy with a review of the consumer price index (CPI) for the June quarter. The CPI increased by 0.6 per cent (in seasonally adjusted terms), after falling a little in the March quarter, to be 1.0 per cent higher over the year. Measures of underlying inflation had picked up to ½ per cent in the June quarter, to be around 1½ per cent over the year. Increases in the prices of volatile items, namely fuel, fruit and vegetables, made some contribution to headline inflation in the quarter, but the increase in inflation was broadly based. Members noted that the latest inflation data had been in line with the forecasts in the May <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. ", " The most recent data on prices and labour costs confirmed that domestic cost pressures had been subdued. This reflected a number of factors associated with low wage growth and pressures on costs and margins, which had resulted in the lowest year-ended rate of non-tradables inflation since the late 1990s. Heightened retail competition in recent years, including from new foreign entrants, had limited increases in goods prices. Rent inflation had remained at low levels and members observed that this was likely to persist for some time given the large pipeline of new construction. In contrast, growth in prices of administered items and the cost of constructing new dwellings had increased in the June quarter. Meanwhile, the prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) had declined in the June quarter and were little changed over the year. Although the depreciation of the exchange rate over the past few years had exerted upward pressure on import prices, this had been largely offset by subdued domestic costs. ", " Members noted that there was little change in the forecast for underlying inflation. The central forecast was still for inflation to remain around 1½ per cent over 2016 before increasing to between 1½ and 2½ per cent by the end of the forecast period. The substantial depreciation of the exchange rate over recent years was expected to exert some upward pressure on inflation for a time and inflation expectations were assumed to return to longer-run average levels. The forecast increase in underlying inflation also reflected the expectation that strengthening labour market conditions would lead to a gradual rise in growth in labour costs. In particular, members noted that growth in average earnings had been low given the spare capacity in the labour market. Moreover, growth in average earnings had been affected by lower wage outcomes in sectors related to the mining industry as a part of the process of adjusting to the lower terms of trade and the end of the mining investment boom. Both of these effects were expected to wane over the forecast period. Members noted that there continued to be considerable uncertainty about momentum in the domestic labour market and the extent to which domestic inflationary pressures would rise over the next few years. ", " The unemployment rate had remained at around 5¾ per cent over recent months. Following a very strong outcome over 2015, employment growth had moderated over the first half of 2016; growth had been concentrated in part-time employment, although full-time employment had increased noticeably in June. Forward-looking labour market indicators had been mixed but, on balance, pointed to employment growth consistent with the unemployment rate remaining around its current level over the coming months. Over the forecast period, though, the unemployment rate was expected to decline slightly to be closer to 5½ per cent, which suggested that there would be ongoing spare capacity in the labour market. Members noted that liquefied natural gas (LNG) production, which is less labour intensive than other industries, was likely to make a significant contribution to output growth in the coming years. This suggested that the past relationship between growth in GDP and employment might be less useful as a guide for forecasting labour market conditions over the coming few years. ", " Real GDP growth appeared to have moderated in the June quarter, following the stronger-than-expected outcome in the March quarter, when unusually favourable weather conditions had boosted resource export volumes. Members noted that there had been little change to the outlook for GDP growth, which was expected to be around 2½–3½ per cent over 2016 before rising to around 3–4 per cent by 2018 (above estimates of potential growth). This outlook reflected the effects of low interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since early 2013, which were supporting the rebalancing of economic activity towards non-resource sectors of the economy. ", " Looking at the components of the forecast for output growth in more detail, members noted that household consumption growth was expected to remain close to its long-run average over the next couple of years. Surveys suggested that households' perceptions of their own finances had continued to be above average, despite relatively weak income growth, and that consumers' unemployment expectations had fallen in recent years. Members observed that household income growth was forecast to rise gradually to around its average rate, consistent with a gradual pick-up in wage and employment growth. These forecasts implied a further slight decline in the household saving ratio, but there was some uncertainty about whether households would respond to developments affecting their disposable incomes by adjusting consumption growth or altering their saving rates. ", " Dwelling investment was expected to increase further, having grown strongly in recent years, although the contribution to output growth was expected to diminish over the forecast period. Building approvals had declined over the preceding year, but remained at high levels and had exceeded the amount of work completed. As a result, the number of dwellings under construction had increased to very high levels. Further, members noted that the pipeline of residential construction work, which included work that had not yet commenced, had increased the risk of oversupply in parts of the country. The outlook for the balance of supply and demand in the housing market was important for the inflation outlook because housing costs make up a significant share of the CPI basket. ", " Turning to the established housing market, members noted that most indicators pointed to an easing in conditions since late 2015. Recent data indicated that housing prices appeared to have grown modestly in the June quarter and had declined a little in most capital cities in July. Data on housing price growth from CoreLogic, which had been discussed at previous meetings, indicated that housing prices had increased very strongly in several cities in April and May. However, new information had revealed that these growth rates were overstated because of changes to CoreLogic's methodology; data from other sources indicated that housing price growth had instead remained moderate in the June quarter. Other information showed that, while auction clearance rates had recently picked up a little in Sydney and Melbourne, the number of auctions was lower than in the preceding year and the average number of days that properties were on the market had increased. Housing credit growth had been little changed in recent months and remained below that of a year earlier. Rent inflation had declined to its lowest level since the mid 1990s and the rental vacancy rate had drifted higher to be close to its long-run average. ", " Net exports were expected to make a positive contribution to output growth over the forecast period, supported by the earlier exchange rate depreciation and ramp-up in LNG production. In contrast, mining investment was expected to fall further, although the effect of this on output growth was expected to diminish over the next year or so. While there had been some signs that non-mining business investment was rising in some parts of the economy, overall it was expected to remain subdued in the near term. The pipeline of non-residential construction had remained at a low level and non-residential building approvals had been little changed over recent years. Looking ahead, indicators of business investment intentions had continued to point to subdued non-mining business investment in the next year or so, although survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had been noticeably above their long-run averages. Non-mining business investment was expected to pick up in the latter part of the forecast period as demand strengthened. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members observed that growth in Australia's major trading partners had been a little below average over the first half of 2016 and that the outlook for their growth overall was unchanged from that presented in May. Despite this, commodity prices had picked up since the beginning of the year, partly because of reductions in supply by some high-cost producers of commodities, including iron ore and coal. GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners was expected to be up to ½ percentage point below its average rate in each year of the forecast period. There had also been little change to the outlook for the terms of trade, which were expected to remain close to current levels over the forecast period, having declined by around 35 per cent since their peak in late 2011. ", " GDP growth in China had eased in the first half of 2016 and was expected to decline further. Growth in the Chinese industrial sector had declined considerably in recent years and subdued conditions in that sector had contributed to a decline in private investment growth. The Chinese Government had implemented additional policy measures to support demand, including increased public spending on infrastructure. Financial conditions had remained accommodative. Conditions in China's residential property market had eased a little recently, while growth in the services sector had been resilient. ", " The effect of the easing in growth in China had been evident in a number of east Asian economies and emerging economies in other regions with strong trade links to China. The outlook for the Chinese economy remained an important source of uncertainty for global growth and the demand for commodities. A substantial slowing in demand in the Chinese property market would pose risks for property developers and related industries, including the steel industry. There was also uncertainty related to how the Chinese authorities would respond to the difficult trade-off involved in supporting growth and avoiding financial disruption in the near term, while achieving more financial discipline and broader reforms over the longer term. ", " GDP growth in the major advanced economies had been around or above estimates of potential growth, supported by expansionary monetary policies and less-contractionary fiscal policies. Members noted, however, that potential growth was lower in most advanced economies than it had been prior to the global financial crisis. Combined with low inflation, this implied low growth in nominal incomes, which potentially created challenges for agents in the economy that had nominal obligations, such as debtors and pension funds, particularly if they had assumed that growth would continue at higher rates. ", " Labour market conditions in most advanced economies had continued to improve, although inflation remained below most central banks' targets. The labour market had been particularly tight in Japan and wages there had risen at an above-average, but still low, rate, although negotiations between unions and large employers had pointed to a moderation in wage growth over the coming year. Growth in economic activity in Japan was expected to remain around its current low rates, supported by the recently announced additional fiscal stimulus package. In the United States, the unemployment rate had fallen to around, or even below, estimates of its long-run equilibrium and there was some evidence of an increase in wage growth. Inflation had also increased in the United States since mid 2015 but, in year-ended terms, had remained a little below the Federal Reserve's inflation goal. While the unemployment rate had continued to decline in the euro area, considerable spare capacity remained and inflation had continued to be lower than the European Central Bank's target. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that markets had stabilised following the volatility surrounding the UK referendum in late June. Price movements during the past month had been driven by US economic data and expectations of further monetary policy stimulus in Japan and Europe. ", " In late July, the Bank of Japan announced further stimulatory policy measures and that a comprehensive review of policy would be undertaken ahead of its next meeting in September. As had been expected by market participants, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept the US federal funds rate unchanged following its July meeting. Market expectations of the length of time before the FOMC would raise the federal funds rate again fell after the release of strong US employment data, but since then had risen in response to weaker-than-expected US GDP data. Members noted that another rate rise in the United States was not priced in by markets until late 2017. Market pricing indicated that the European Central Bank was expected to ease monetary policy at its meeting in September in response to concerns that the uncertainty following the UK referendum might weaken the economic outlook for the euro area. The Bank of England had indicated that it expected to ease policy at its meeting in coming days. ", " Sovereign bond yields declined to record lows in early July and subsequent movements were largely in response to the flow of US economic data and expectations of Japanese policy stimulus. Yields remained materially below levels at the start of the year, most notably in the United Kingdom. Japanese government bond yields increased by 10 basis points after the Bank of Japan announced its recent stimulus measures. Members observed that Australian government bond yields had moved broadly in line with global developments, to reach a historical low. The downward revision to Standard &amp; Poor's outlook for Australia's sovereign credit rating had no impact. Issuance of Australian Government Securities had been well received in July. ", " The US dollar and euro were little changed in trade-weighted terms over the past month, while the Japanese yen had depreciated following expectations of further monetary policy stimulus, before appreciating once it was apparent that the stimulus was more limited than expected. The Australian dollar was also little changed. The Chinese renminbi depreciated by 22 per cent against the yen and by 7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past year. ", " Members were briefed on recent developments in global funding markets, including foreign exchange swap markets. They noted that the cost of borrowing US dollars in exchange for euros and yen in short-term foreign exchange swap markets had increased over 2016 to date, as had spreads on short-term bank funding in US dollars. These developments appeared to have reflected increased demand from Japanese investors and banks, as well as impending reforms to US money market funds. The Bank of Japan's latest policy announcement included a facility to enhance access to US dollar swap lines, which reduced the cost of borrowing US dollars in exchange for yen. In Australia, the spread of 3-month bank bill rates to overnight indexed swap rates had declined relative to levels earlier in the year, but remained higher than during 2015. ", " Share price indices in the major markets had increased over the past month, with the US share market reaching a new high. The share prices of banks globally had underperformed owing to concerns that continued low interest rates would erode their profitability as well as ongoing concerns about the health of the Italian banking system. A number of open-ended UK commercial property funds had suspended redemptions as a result of liquidity pressures following the UK referendum. In Australia, share prices rose, including for resource companies as a result of higher commodity prices. ", " Australian banks' bond issuance was strong in July and in the year to date, while corporate bond issuance had remained subdued, particularly for resource companies. Members noted that bank deposit rates and lending rates had generally declined in line with the 25 basis point cash rate reduction in May, with the exception of term deposit rates and large business lending rates, which were little changed. ", " Pricing in domestic financial markets indicated a 75 per cent chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners had remained slightly below average in the first half of 2016 and was expected to continue at around this pace in each year of the forecast period. This forecast was largely as had been expected three months earlier. Growth in China had continued to moderate, which was having noticeable effects on other economies with large trade exposures to China. Actions by the Chinese authorities were supporting the near-term growth outlook, but there was uncertainty about the underlying pace and composition of China's growth over the longer term. Growth in the advanced economies had been around or above potential and labour market conditions had continued to improve. Despite this, inflation had remained below most central banks' targets. Consequently, monetary policy had continued to be highly accommodative in most economies and there was a reasonable likelihood of further stimulus by a number of the major central banks. ", " Commodity prices overall had risen since the previous meeting and the Australian dollar exchange rate had appreciated a little since earlier in the year. Changes to expectations about central banks' policies continued to have an important influence on global exchange rate developments. The terms of trade for Australia were expected to be little changed over the forecast period, largely as had been previously forecast. ", " The latest CPI data for Australia had confirmed that inflation pressures were subdued, as had been expected when the previous forecasts were discussed in May. As such, the outlook for underlying inflation was little changed. Underlying inflation was expected to remain low for a time before picking up gradually as spare capacity in labour and many product markets diminished. ", " The outlook for Australian GDP growth and the unemployment rate had also been little changed since May. While GDP growth had been stronger than expected in the March quarter, reflecting unanticipated strength in resource export volumes, it was expected to have been more modest in the June quarter. Economic growth was expected to pick up to be above estimates of potential by mid 2017. Employment growth was expected to increase as a consequence and the unemployment rate was expected to fall marginally over the forecast period. Low interest rates and the depreciation of the Australian dollar since 2013 were expected to continue to support the necessary adjustments in the economy following the end of the mining investment boom, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this. ", " In coming to their policy decision, members noted that the recent CPI data had confirmed that inflation was likely to remain low for some time. They also observed that while prospects for growth were positive, there was room for stronger growth, which could be assisted by lower interest rates. At the same time, members noted that indicators for the established housing market in the first half of 2016 had pointed to an easing in conditions, including lower housing credit growth and an easing in housing price pressures. These developments were consistent with the tightening in lending standards towards the end of 2015 and decline in turnover in the housing market to low levels. This suggested that the risks associated with rising household sector leverage and rapid gains in housing prices had diminished. ", " Taking all these considerations into account, the Board, on balance, judged that prospects for sustainable growth in the economy, with inflation returning to target over time, would be improved by easing monetary policy at this meeting.

Prior to being appointed Governor in 2006, Mr Stevens had served as Deputy Governor for almost five years and had presented to the Board regularly as Assistant Governor (Economic) between 1997 and 2001. The Governor-designate, Philip Lowe, paid tribute to Mr Stevens' exceptional contribution to the deliberations of the Board over this long period. On behalf of all members, he expressed appreciation and admiration for Mr Stevens' professionalism and integrity, his thoughtful and consultative approach to policymaking and for the exceptional judgements he made during a challenging period for the global and Australian economy. Members recorded their appreciation of Mr Stevens' dedication to public policy in a career spanning more than three decades and wished him well for the future. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic conditions by noting that the prices of Australia's commodity exports had increased since the previous meeting and were around 30 per cent above the lows of early this year. Further reductions in production of bulk commodities by high-cost producers in China had contributed to these price increases. Reflecting the rise in commodity prices since earlier in the year, the terms of trade had increased in the June quarter. ", " The ABS capital expenditure survey and measures of work done on non-residential construction indicated that mining investment had continued to fall in the June quarter, in line with the forecast presented in the August <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. The estimate of nominal investment intentions from the capital expenditure survey implied a further large decline in mining investment in 2016/17, in line with earlier expectations. However, the peak subtraction from GDP growth was still expected to have occurred in 2015/16 and members noted that there had been some signs of an improvement in sentiment in parts of the mining industry. ", " Members observed that developments in commodity prices and mining investment had continued to have significant effects on economic activity in resource-rich regions of the country and that the effect of the spillovers from the decline in mining investment and commodity prices would persist for some time. The regional differences had been apparent in labour market outcomes. Members noted that a decline in full-time employment since the beginning of the year had been recorded in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland, but that part-time employment growth had been broadly based across the country. The relative strength of part-time employment had partly reflected growth in industries that have a higher proportion of part-time jobs, such as household services, although liaison contacts had also reported that employers more generally had been taking a cautious approach to hiring. Forward-looking indicators suggested that employment growth would remain relatively subdued in Western Australia and Queensland but would be stronger elsewhere. Overall, the forward-looking indicators were consistent with little change in the unemployment rate in the coming months; the unemployment rate had fallen slightly in July to 5.7 per cent. ", " Growth in the aggregate wage price index (WPI) had stabilised at low levels; the private sector WPI had increased by 0.5 per cent in each of the past six quarters. Growth in the WPI had continued to be lowest in the mining-exposed industries and states, although it also looked to have stabilised in these areas. ", " Members noted that the June quarter national accounts, which would be released the day after the meeting, were expected to record moderate GDP growth. Net exports were expected to have made a smaller contribution to GDP growth following strong growth in resource exports in the March quarter, whereas data released during the meeting indicated that public demand had made a noticeable contribution in the June quarter. Over the first half of the year, GDP growth had been expected to have been close to estimates of potential, which was consistent with the slight change in the unemployment rate that had been observed over that period. ", " Growth in household consumption was expected to have remained around average in the June quarter. Household perceptions of their personal finances had continued to be above average, although growth in retail sales had declined slightly in recent months. Members discussed the effect of lower interest rates on consumption growth via the cash flow channel of monetary policy. They noted that the positive effect of lower interest rates on the disposable income of borrowing households is larger than the negative effect on the income of lender households, as the average borrower household has two-to-three times more net interest-bearing debt than the average lender household has in net interest-earning assets. In addition, on average, borrower households are likely to be significantly more responsive to changes in income that are related to changes in interest rates because they are more likely to be liquidity constrained. Members noted that, since the global financial crisis, borrower households have been likely to use more of an increase in their cash flow from any source to prepay their debt, which might imply a delay in the response of consumption spending to lower interest rates. ", " Private residential building approvals had increased in July, to be around the high levels observed in 2015, and there continued to be a significant amount of work in the pipeline. Members noted that this could be expected to support high levels of dwelling investment for some time. ", " Conditions in established housing markets had generally eased over 2016. Growth in housing prices had declined at the national level and across most capital cities over the past year, although there remained considerable variation by location. Housing prices had been declining in year-ended terms in Perth for some time. In the rental market, inflation had remained around historical lows and had also eased across most capital cities, most notably in Perth, where rents had continued to decline. The aggregate rental vacancy rate had drifted higher and was close to its long-run average. ", " Other indicators for the housing market had also generally pointed to weaker conditions than a year earlier. In the established housing market, the number of auctions had declined and remained lower than a year earlier, even though auction clearance rates had increased of late (particularly in Sydney). In the private treaty market – where, nationally, over 80 per cent of transactions occur – turnover had also declined since the previous year and the average number of days that a property was on the market had been on an upward trend. Members noted that sales of new properties were included in the turnover data, but that there might be measurement problems related to the long lag between purchasing and settling new properties bought off the plan, which could lead to revisions. Finally, in recent months the value of housing loan approvals had been broadly steady and housing credit growth had been lower than a year earlier, consistent with the earlier tightening in lending standards and low turnover. ", " Business investment had fallen further in the June quarter, driven by a decline in mining investment in line with earlier expectations. The ABS capital expenditure survey also indicated that non-mining business investment had been little changed over the past couple of years. Members noted that uncertainty about future demand growth still appeared to be weighing on non-mining business investment. The pipeline of non-residential construction work had remained low, although non-residential approvals had increased a little in recent months and survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained above their long-run averages. Growth in business credit had eased a little, although non-mining profits looked to have increased. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Growth in Australia's major trading partners had been a little below its decade average over the first half of 2016, which was in line with expectations at the time of the August <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. Conditions in the global industrial sector remained subdued but looked to have stabilised recently. GDP growth in the major advanced economies had been close to, or above, trend over the past year and labour market outcomes had continued to improve. Globally, inflation remained low and below most central banks' targets. Members noted, however, that the weighted average of core inflation for the economies from which Australia sources its imports had been around its longer-term average and that movements in Australian dollar import prices had been dominated by changes in the exchange rate rather than global price developments. ", " Growth in China had continued to decline. Ongoing overcapacity in mining and parts of the manufacturing sector had resulted in much weaker output and investment growth in those industries compared with other parts of the economy, which had been more resilient. However, producer prices had ceased declining in a number of these sectors, possibly indicating some reduction in overcapacity. Residential property market conditions and residential investment growth had picked up in the first half of the year, but appeared to have eased recently. More broadly, there had been some easing of growth in financing to the real economy in recent months. ", " Year-ended growth in Japanese GDP had remained above estimates of potential growth, which had declined to a very low rate partly as a result of rapid population ageing. Growth in exports and business investment had remained weak. The government had announced fiscal stimulus measures, which were expected to provide some support to activity over the coming year. Across the rest of east Asia, growth in GDP had picked up a little in the June quarter, but remained below average in year-ended terms. In the high-income east Asian economies, where growth had been relatively subdued, monetary and fiscal policy measures had been implemented to support domestic demand. In the United States, output had risen modestly in the June quarter and growth had eased in year-ended terms, but had remained close to estimates of potential growth. GDP in the euro area had continued to grow at an above-trend rate. ", " Labour market conditions had improved in many advanced economies. The Japanese labour market remained very tight and unit labour costs growth had increased relative to long-term averages, yet both headline and core inflation in year-ended terms had fallen over the past six months or so. In the United States, the unemployment rate was around estimates of full employment and this appeared to be putting some upward pressure on wages. Members noted that growth in unit labour costs had picked up, reflecting a decline in productivity growth, which had also been evident in a number of other advanced economies. Despite this, core and headline inflation in the United States had been little changed in recent months and remained below the Federal Reserve's inflation goal. In the euro area, the unemployment rate had declined gradually since 2013 and employment growth had been increasingly driven by full-time employment, but wage growth had remained low and inflation had continued to be below the European Central Bank's target. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that it had been a relatively quiet month in financial markets, with low turnover in a number of markets. ", " Commentary by US Federal Reserve officials had slightly raised market expectations of an increase in the federal funds rate, with market pricing indicating that the probability of an increase by the end of the year was high. Members were briefed on the easing measures announced by the Bank of England (BoE) at its August meeting, which included a reduction in the policy rate, the introduction of a term funding scheme for banks and two bond purchase programs. These measures were projected to result in an expansion of the BoE's balance sheet over 2017, although the BoE's asset holdings as a share of GDP were projected to remain lower than those of the European Central Bank, and well below those of the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Nevertheless, the share of government securities outstanding held by the BoE was relatively high. Members noted that the BoJ had announced that it would publish a comprehensive review of policy effectiveness at its September meeting. ", " Members noted that the yield curve in the United Kingdom had shifted down markedly since the start of 2016, with around half of this shift having occurred after the June referendum. Japanese government bond yields had been largely unchanged since rising significantly following the BoJ's decision in late July to provide little additional stimulus. Yields on 10-year Australian government bonds had reached a record low following the Board's decision to lower the target cash rate in August and the spread to US Treasuries had also narrowed to its lowest level in around 15 years. ", " Corporate bond spreads in the United Kingdom had narrowed after the BoE announced that, as part of its suite of easing measures, in September it would begin purchasing investment grade bonds issued by non-financial corporates. Issuance of sterling-denominated bonds by UK corporates had increased strongly in August. ", " Members were briefed on the continued impact of the BoJ's stimulatory policy and US money market reforms on global funding markets. The cost of borrowing US dollars in short-term money markets had risen further over the past month, ahead of the implementation of US money market reforms in October. The cost of borrowing US dollars in exchange for yen and some other currencies in short-term foreign exchange swap markets had also remained elevated. This appeared to reflect strong demand from Japanese investors and banks as they searched for yield in light of the BoJ's quantitative easing measures. The profitability of lending Australian dollar securities for cash, swapping the proceeds into yen and purchasing Japanese government bonds had pushed Australian short-term secured lending rates higher. Members noted that, prior to the meeting, these developments had had little effect on Australian banks' funding costs – the spread of the bank bill swap rate to the overnight index swap rate had declined in recent months. ", " While currency markets had continued to be influenced by monetary policy developments in the advanced economies, there had been little change in the Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi or Australian dollar exchange rates over the past month. ", " Global equity markets had been little changed over the past month, while Australian equity prices had declined a little, as profit results had been generally somewhat weaker than expected in most sectors. ", " Members noted that the reductions in the cash rate in May and August this year had now been largely passed through to deposit rates, with the exception of rates on term deposits, which account for around 20 per cent of banks' overall funding. Term deposit interest rates for maturities of less than one year, which account for the vast majority, had been little changed during 2016. While rates on term deposits for longer maturities had increased in August, these make up only around 2 per cent of major banks' funding. ", " Australian banks' bond issuance had remained strong in August and costs of this funding had declined further. ", " Members observed that around half of the reduction in the cash rate in August had been passed through to housing and business lending rates. ", " Pricing in domestic financial markets indicated that there was little chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members observed that the data for the international and domestic economies over the past month had been broadly consistent with the forecasts published in the August <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. ", " Growth in Australia's major trading partners had been slightly below average. Growth had eased a little further in China and had remained relatively subdued in the higher-income economies in the Asian region. There appeared to have been some reduction in mining production in China, which had contributed, in part, to an increase in commodity prices over the course of this year. Labour market conditions had continued to improve in several advanced economies, but inflation had remained lower than central banks' targets. Globally, monetary policy remained very accommodative. Members noted that in the United States there had been some signs of gradually rising wage pressures and employment growth had been strong of late. This had led financial markets to increase their assessment of the likelihood of a rise in the US federal funds rate before the end of the year. ", " Financial markets had continued to function effectively and funding costs for high-quality borrowers remained low. ", " Domestically, recent data suggested that growth had been around estimates of potential growth over the first half of 2016, despite further large falls in business investment. Interest-sensitive sectors of the economy were being supported by accommodative monetary policy. The lower exchange rate since 2013 was continuing to support activity in the traded sector of the economy, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the necessary adjustments in the economy. ", " The unemployment rate had been little changed at around 5¾ per cent over 2016 and employment growth had been steady at around 2 per cent in year-ended terms. Strong growth in part-time employment had been apparent in most states, while full-time employment had fallen in the mining-exposed states. Forward-looking indicators had been consistent with only a slight change in the unemployment rate in coming months. Domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, had remained low and were expected to remain so for some time. ", " Housing market conditions overall appeared to have eased since the previous year, although the dwelling construction cycle remained in a strong upswing. The best available information suggested that housing prices had risen modestly over the past year and turnover had been below average. Consistent with this and supervisory measures that had strengthened lending standards in the housing market, housing credit growth had slowed over 2016. Members noted that there continued to be a considerable volume of apartments scheduled to be completed over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern states. ", " Taking into account the recent data, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that the current stance of monetary policy was consistent with sustainable growth in the Australian economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

{"Date": ["Sydney – 7 June 2016"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), John Akehurst, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Allan Moss AO, Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna ", " Members granted leave of absence to Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor) in terms of section 18A of the <cite>Reserve Bank Act 1959</cite>. "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members began their discussion of the Australian economy by noting that growth in real GDP in the March quarter was stronger than anticipated in the May <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. Growth was expected to be more moderate in the June quarter, but year-ended growth was likely to remain slightly above estimates of potential. Growth in nominal GDP had been lower than growth in real GDP, as had been expected, reflecting declines in the terms of trade and some decline in domestic prices. ", " Growth in the March quarter was underpinned by a large contribution from net exports. Export volumes had been boosted by further increases in resource production from newly completed projects and the absence of adverse weather, which often affects the ability to export resource commodities around the beginning of the year. Service exports had also grown strongly, supported by the depreciation of the Australian dollar in recent years. Members noted that the contribution of resource exports to year-ended GDP growth had been offset by further falls in mining investment, such that growth in mining activity overall had been quite modest over the year to the March quarter. ", " In contrast, year-ended growth in non-mining activity had been running at above 3 per cent. Over the year to the March quarter, consumption growth had been around its decade average and there had been continued growth in dwelling investment, supported by the low level of interest rates. Government spending had also grown at an around-average pace, while non-mining investment had declined. ", " Consumption increased by 3 per cent over the year to the March quarter. This was slightly stronger than the growth in household disposable income, which members observed had been stronger than measures of income growth for the economy as a whole. The household saving rate rose in the quarter, but had declined gradually over the year. Liaison suggested that retailers had been more cautious about the outlook of late, although trading conditions had remained generally positive, and surveys suggested that consumers' perceptions of their own finances were still a little above average. ", " Dwelling investment had continued to grow strongly over the year, consistent with the substantial amount of work in the pipeline noted in previous meetings. Members observed that private residential building approvals had increased strongly in April, to be close to peaks seen earlier in 2015. Although these data are quite volatile from month to month, the trend for building approvals had been stronger than expected of late and the pipeline of residential work yet to be done had remained at high levels. This implied that growth in new dwelling investment would continue to add to the supply of housing over the next year or so, particularly in the eastern capitals. ", " In established housing markets, prices increased significantly in Sydney and Melbourne over April and May and, to a lesser extent, in a number of other capital cities. Auction clearance rates and the number of auctions increased in May, but remained lower than a year earlier. At the same time, the monthly data available for April showed that there had been a further easing in housing credit growth and the total value of housing loan approvals, excluding refinancing, had fallen in the month. Members noted that the divergence in the trends in housing price and credit growth was not expected to persist over a long period of time. ", " As had been expected, business investment continued to decline in the March quarter. As a share of GDP, mining investment had fallen to around 4 per cent, down from a peak of 8 per cent in 2012. Non-mining investment also appeared to have declined in the quarter, reflecting a fall in non-residential construction consistent with the low level of non-residential building approvals. Investment intentions from the latest ABS capital expenditure survey continued to imply a further sharp fall in mining investment and a decline in non-mining investment in 2016/17. Members noted that this survey captures less than half of the activity included in the more comprehensive national accounts measure of non-mining business investment. In particular, the ABS capital expenditure survey excludes some industries, such as health and education, and investment in intangible assets such as software, which had become an increasingly important component of investment. ", " Business surveys implied that non-mining business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained above average more recently, despite non-mining business profits declining a little as a share of GDP in the March quarter. Growth in business credit remained on a gradual upward trend. ", " Public expenditure increased at an around-average rate over the year to the March quarter. The 2016/17 Australian Government Budget, along with the state budgets that had been released by the time of the meeting, implied a number of years of slightly larger deficits than in the midyear fiscal updates. Most of the revisions had reflected lower-than-expected tax receipts owing to the weaker outlook for wage growth. The consolidated deficit was still expected to narrow progressively from 2017/18. ", " As expected, there had been some moderation in employment growth in 2016, following the strength seen at the end of 2015, while the unemployment rate had been steady at around 5¾ per cent. Forward-looking indicators for employment in the near term had been mixed, but overall they were consistent with moderate employment growth in the months ahead. ", " Members noted that new data on growth in labour costs for the March quarter had also been somewhat mixed, although they continued to suggest that wage pressures remained low. Growth in the wage price index (WPI) edged down in the March quarter. However, the WPI measure including bonuses implied that private-sector wage growth had been little changed for the past two years. Also, the measure of earnings derived from the national accounts picked up over the year to the March quarter, and was growing a little faster outside Western Australia and Queensland, which had been most directly affected by the decline in mining investment and commodity prices over the past few years. ", " The rise in labour productivity apparent in the data over the year to the March quarter meant that unit labour costs as measured had increased only modestly over this period, and had even declined a little in the March quarter. Members observed a broad correspondence between movements in unit labour cost growth and the terms of trade over the past decade or so: unit labour costs had grown at an above-average pace throughout the period when the terms of trade were increasing, but were little changed over the past four and a half years while the terms of trade had been declining. This suggested that, while changes in the nominal exchange rate had played the key role in helping the economy adjust to the rise and fall in the terms of trade, this process had been assisted by adjustments in the growth rate of wages. ", " Short-term measures of inflation expectations – from consumers, market economists, union officials and inflation swaps – had remained below average. Long-term inflation expectations had also remained below average. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Largely as expected, growth in Australia's major trading partners moderated in the March quarter to a year-ended rate that was about ½ percentage point below its decade average. Growth in China and east Asia eased further and Japanese GDP was unchanged over the year to the March quarter. Output growth in the United States and the euro area had remained around – or even a little above – trend in year-ended terms and the unemployment rates in these economies continued to decline. Growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade remained subdued and inflation in most advanced economies remained below central banks' targets. ", " Recent indicators suggested that the weakness in the Chinese industrial sector had continued, although policy measures to support activity appeared to have been providing some offset. Growth in industrial production remained relatively subdued and growth in private-sector fixed asset investment had declined further, while public-sector investment (particularly in infrastructure) had grown strongly and government spending remained at an elevated level. Conditions in the real estate sector had strengthened over recent months, following earlier measures by the Chinese authorities to support demand for housing. Growth in real estate investment had increased, following a prolonged period of weakness, and the level of floor space sold had risen further. Despite this, steel production had been little changed over the preceding year. Actions by the Chinese authorities designed to curb speculative activity in commodity futures markets appeared to have contributed to recent falls in spot iron ore prices, although they remained around 30 per cent above their trough in December 2015. ", " Output in east Asia continued to grow at a below-average pace in the March quarter, reflecting moderate domestic final demand growth and a decline in exports. Members noted that the high-income economies in the region were particularly exposed to trade and had experienced weaker investment outcomes than middle-income economies in the region. Employment growth had also been slowing over the past year in the high-income economies and there were tentative signs that unemployment had begun to edge higher in South Korea and Taiwan. Core inflation had been drifting lower recently, particularly among the high-income east Asian economies. Despite external weakness, growth in India increased to around 8 per cent in year-ended terms and inflation remained around 5 per cent (the Reserve Bank of India's target for 2016). ", " Members noted that growth in many advanced economies had been at, or a little above, potential, which was consistent with ongoing improvements in labour market conditions in these economies. In the United States, although the most recent monthly increase in payrolls employment was small, the unemployment rate continued to fall. The improvement in US labour market conditions and rising wealth had supported relatively strong growth of household consumption and residential investment over the past year. In the euro area, the unemployment rate continued to decline and the level of GDP had surpassed its pre-crisis peak in the March quarter. ", " Members observed that the ongoing tightening of labour market conditions in the United States and Japan had led to some increase in wage pressures and that unit labour cost growth had been noticeably higher than its 20-year average in both countries. In the United States, this had contributed to a pick-up in core inflation over the past six months or so. In Japan, core inflation had remained around its highs of recent years, although it had declined a little since the beginning of 2016. Japanese inflation expectations had declined markedly over the past year and the Bank of Japan had revised down its GDP and inflation forecasts at its most recent policy meeting. Improvements in labour market conditions in the euro area had not yet been sufficient to increase wage and unit labour cost growth. Core inflation had declined further in year-ended terms in recent months and remained below the European Central Bank's target. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that market expectations about the timing of monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve had changed markedly during the past month. Expectations of a tightening in the near term had increased following the release of the minutes of the April meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, but had subsequently declined after the release of the lower-than-expected US employment data for May. At the time of the meeting, market pricing implied that a policy tightening was likely only by around the end of the year. ", " The main effect of the swings in market expectations about US monetary policy had been on exchange rates. There had been a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar as expectations of tightening increased, which was partly reversed following the release of the US employment data. ", " The Chinese renminbi had been little changed over the past month on a trade-weighted basis. The People's Bank of China had generally been setting the renminbi fixing rate against the US dollar lower to offset the broad-based US dollar appreciation. Members noted that the decline in Chinese foreign currency reserves had ceased in the previous two months. ", " Reflecting changes in the current and expected stance of both domestic and US monetary policy, the Australian dollar depreciated by around 4 per cent against the US dollar and by around 3 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, to be a little above its January lows. ", " Uncertainty about the outcome of the upcoming referendum on whether the United Kingdom should exit the European Union had resulted in an increase in forward-looking measures of volatility in the UK pound exchange rate against the US dollar. ", " Sovereign bond yields had been generally steady over the past month, before dropping sharply in most major markets following the softer-than-expected US employment data. Yields on long-term Australian Government Securities had also declined to reach an all-time low in early June, and the spread to US Treasuries had narrowed. ", " Global equity indices were broadly unchanged over the past month, while emerging market share prices had declined a little. The Australian share market had outperformed other markets, supported by the reduction in the cash rate in May, although resource companies' share prices had declined in line with iron ore prices. ", " Bond issuance by Australian banks had been strong over the past month, with issuance of hybrids particularly large. ", " Following the 25 basis point cut in the cash rate in May, most deposit and lending rates had been reduced by 25 basis points. This reversed the rate increases in 2015 to borrowers for owner-occupier housing, while borrowers for investor housing continued to pay higher rates than a year earlier. Members observed that although the rates being paid by most borrowers had moved lower as a result of the reduction in the cash rate, banks' serviceability requirements for borrowers had not changed. ", " Pricing in domestic financial markets indicated that there was a very low chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that, as had been previously expected, Australia's trading partners were likely to grow by a bit less than average in 2016 and 2017. In year-ended terms, growth had continued to moderate in China and much of east Asia, while growth in the United States and the euro area had continued at, or a little above, trend and had been accompanied by further declines in unemployment rates. Monetary policy was very accommodative in the major economies and was expected to remain so given that inflation was below most central bank targets. Members noted that conditions in global financial markets had generally been calmer over recent months following the period of volatility early in the year. ", " The Australian dollar had depreciated noticeably since the previous meeting, following the reduction in the cash rate and the publication of the Bank's revised inflation outlook in the May <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. An increase in expectations of a tightening in US monetary policy had also played a role, as had the decline in commodity prices, which was consistent with expectations that the rally in bulk commodity prices in early 2016 would unwind at some point. ", " Recent data on the domestic economy had generally been positive. GDP growth had picked up in the March quarter to be about ½ percentage point stronger than expected. Growth over the year had increased to be a bit above estimates of potential growth, reflecting a stronger expansion in non-mining activity. This was being supported by low interest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013. Further declines in mining investment had been largely offset by strength in net resource exports. Members noted that an appreciation of the exchange rate could complicate the adjustment of the economy to the lower terms of trade. ", " The pick-up in output growth was broadly consistent with the decline in the unemployment rate from 6¼ per cent to 5¾ per cent over the year to the March quarter. More timely labour market data indicated that the unemployment rate had remained around 5¾ per cent, but that employment growth appeared to have lost some momentum following very strong growth in late 2015, which was largely as expected. While the latest suite of data had confirmed that labour cost pressures remained subdued in the March quarter, a few of the wage measures were slightly more positive. Nevertheless, inflation was expected to remain low for some time. ", " In the housing market, there continued to be indications that the effects of supervisory measures had strengthened lending standards, with a number of lenders taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Housing prices had begun to rise again recently, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. The extent of future rises, however, was likely to be affected by the considerable supply of apartments scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. In recent months, the pace of housing credit growth had edged down further, having peaked towards the end of last year, while growth in credit to businesses had increased over the past year. ", " Given these developments, and following the reduction in the cash rate in May, the Board judged that leaving the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and inflation returning to target over time.

GDP growth over the year was higher than had been forecast a year earlier and above estimates of potential growth. Overall, growth in output in the September quarter was expected to have continued at a moderate pace similar to that seen in the June quarter. ", " Mining activity had grown over the year to the June quarter by more than had been expected a year earlier due to a larger-than-expected increase in resource export volumes, which looked to have increased further in July. Notwithstanding this, labour market conditions remained relatively weak in Queensland and Western Australia, reflecting the effects of earlier falls in the terms of trade and ongoing declines in mining investment. Members noted that the ramp-up in liquefied natural gas production would make a significant contribution to GDP growth over the forecast period, but was not expected to lead to many new jobs. ", " Non-mining activity had grown at around its long-run average rate over the year to the June quarter, supported by low interest rates and the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. Growth had been broadly based and supported by strong growth in public demand. However, non-mining investment had been little changed over the past few years even though survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained above their long-run averages. Growth in output and employment, and business conditions more generally, had continued to be strongest in the services sector. ", " Household consumption growth had moderated in the June quarter. This was driven by a decline in the consumption of goods, consistent with low growth in retail sales volumes, while growth in the consumption of services had remained around average. More timely indicators of household consumption had been mixed: although growth in retail sales had been low over the few months to July, households' perceptions of their personal finances had remained above average. Members noted that future consumption growth would largely depend on growth in household income. Members observed that the household saving ratio had been little changed in the June quarter but remained on a gradual downward trend, in line with earlier forecasts. ", " Dwelling investment had been increasing more rapidly than housing credit, suggesting that households were increasing their housing equity at a relatively strong rate. Indeed, private dwelling investment had continued to grow at an above-average rate in the June quarter. The large amount of work in the pipeline and the high level of building approvals in July and August were expected to support a high level of dwelling investment for some time, although the rate of growth in dwelling investment was expected to decline over the forecast period. ", " In the established housing market, conditions had eased relative to a year earlier, although there had been some signs that conditions had strengthened a little more recently. Housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne had increased in recent months and auction clearance rates in these two cities had risen. In contrast, turnover and housing credit growth had been noticeably lower than a year earlier and the value of housing loan approvals had been little changed in recent months. Conditions in the rental market had continued to soften, particularly in Perth, where population growth had been easing and the rental vacancy rate had risen. ", " Indicators of labour market conditions had been mixed. The unemployment rate had declined to 5.6 per cent in August and had fallen by around ½ percentage point over the past year. However, the underemployment rate, which captures workers who would like to work more hours, had increased over the past year. Members noted that it was important to consider the number of additional hours workers wanted to work in order to assess the degree of underutilisation in the labour force more accurately. They observed that there had been similar developments in a number of other countries, including the United States, where spare capacity in the labour market had also not declined to the same extent as implied by the decline in the unemployment rate. In Australia, part-time work had accounted for all of the increase in employment since the beginning of the year, with full-time employment having been little changed. Looking ahead, the increase in job vacancies and advertisements was consistent with moderate employment growth in the coming months, although outcomes were expected to vary across states. ", " Growth in average earnings per hour recorded in the national accounts – a broader measure of earnings than provided by the wage price index – had picked up over the past two quarters, to be 3 per cent over the year to the June quarter. This had provided some evidence that the downward pressure on earnings from the movement of workers in high-paying mining-related jobs to lower-paying jobs in the non-mining economy was waning. Aggregate unit labour costs had been little changed for almost five years as growth in earnings had been matched by growth in labour productivity. Members noted that this had helped to improve the international competitiveness of Australian businesses. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that growth in Australia's major trading partners appeared to have been slightly stronger than expected in the June and September quarters. Over recent years, consumption growth in Australia's major trading partners had been resilient but investment growth had declined, as had growth of global trade and industrial production. ", " Growth in China appeared to have stabilised in recent months, supported by fiscal stimulus and accommodative financial conditions. Growth in private investment had shown some signs of stabilising, after declining since late 2011, and consumer spending appeared to be holding up, consistent with stable labour market conditions. Investment in the residential property market had increased and growth in output in some industrial sectors, including steel, machinery, equipment and motor vehicle manufacturing, had picked up a little. These developments had supported Chinese demand for commodities at the same time as Chinese production of iron ore and coal had been scaled back. As a result, imports of both commodities had been on an upward trend, and iron ore imports from Australia had remained around record highs in recent months. Stronger demand and temporary supply disruptions had contributed to increases in spot prices for coal. Members noted that the risks in China associated with the build-up of debt in an environment of slower growth and questions about the sustainability of current policy settings remained a source of concern for economic prospects in China. ", " Commodity prices overall had increased since the previous meeting and were well above the lows recorded earlier in the year. Australia's terms of trade were expected to rise again in the September quarter, following the first increase in a few years in the June quarter. Members noted that if the terms of trade were to be little changed over the forecast period, as expected, it would be more positive for profits, wages and fiscal revenues than if the decline in the terms of trade seen over recent years were to continue. ", " In the major advanced economies, growth in output had been sufficient for labour market conditions to improve further. This, in turn, had contributed to relatively strong consumption growth. In contrast, growth in investment had remained subdued in most advanced economies. Despite continued declines in unemployment, unit labour cost growth had eased in Japan and remained low in the euro area, and inflation had remained below the central bank target in both economies. In contrast, the tighter labour market conditions in the United States had contributed to further increases in unit labour cost growth, which had been broadly correlated with movements in underlying inflation over time. However, inflation was still a little below the Federal Reserve's goal. Monetary policy settings remained very stimulatory in all advanced economies. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members observed that financial markets had been focused on the actions of central banks in recent months. During September, there had been some volatility in bond markets around the major central bank meetings and in share markets related to concerns about the health of some European banks. Markets had otherwise been generally quiet, including in Australia, and financial conditions had remained favourable. ", " The US Federal Reserve had left the federal funds rate unchanged at its September meeting, having decided to wait for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before raising the policy rate. Three members of the Federal Open Market Committee had voted to raise the federal funds rate at the September meeting and most members expected to raise the policy rate in December. The latest market pricing implied that markets considered a rate increase likely in December. ", " Following a comprehensive review of its monetary policy, in September the Bank of Japan (BoJ) had introduced a commitment to exceed its 2 per cent inflation target for a sustained period in order to increase inflation expectations. The BoJ had also announced a target of around zero for the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds, with these yields having been below zero for most of 2016, and maintained the short-term policy rate for central bank deposits at −0.1 per cent. ", " The European Central Bank (ECB) had left policy rates unchanged at its September meeting. Members noted that there had been little increase in the ECB's net lending to banks despite banks being able to borrow from the ECB at negative interest rates if certain on-lending targets were met. The ECB had also announced that a review of its asset purchase program would be conducted to ensure its smooth implementation, which is scheduled to run until at least the end of March 2017. The Bank of England (BoE) had also left its policy rate unchanged at its meeting in September, restating its view that the effective lower bound for the policy rate is less than the current level of 0.25 per cent but above zero. ", " Movements in 10-year government bond yields in the major economies over 2016 had largely reflected market expectations for the scale of central bank bond purchases. Yields remained very low in the major economies, as well as in Australia. ", " Credit market conditions had remained favourable for most corporates. Issuance had been strong in August and September, particularly in the United Kingdom following the BoE's announcement in early August of its bond-buying program. Two corporate bonds had been issued in the euro area at negative yields. ", " Major share price indices had been broadly unchanged over September. Members noted that renewed market concerns about Deutsche Bank had seen its share price fall sharply during the month, following news that the US Department of Justice was seeking fines from Deutsche Bank related to its mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities prior to the global financial crisis. ", " Members noted that the cost of borrowing US dollars for short terms in wholesale markets had risen further in September ahead of the implementation of new regulations for US money market funds in mid October and given the ongoing influence of stimulatory monetary policy in Japan and elsewhere. Members noted that Australian repurchase agreement rates had also risen further, but that the daily cash rate target had continued to be met and bank bill rates had been unaffected. ", " Foreign exchange markets had been fairly quiet over the previous month. The Australian dollar had appreciated a little against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis during September. The US dollar and Chinese renminbi exchange rates had been little changed in trade-weighted terms. The yen had appreciated by around 2 per cent against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the month, as market expectations of additional easing by the BoJ in September had not been met. Members noted that the yen was around 20 per cent higher than when the BoJ had eased monetary policy in late January. ", " Australian share prices had risen slightly over September, reflecting strength in the resources sector in line with higher commodity prices, as well as slightly higher prices for financial stocks, while share prices in other sectors had declined. ", " Members observed that the cash rate reduction in August had now been passed on in full to at-call deposit rates, while rates on term deposits with a maturity of 12 months or more, which make up only around 2 per cent of banks' funding, had increased. Interest rates paid by the major Australian banks on their outstanding wholesale debt, which makes up around one-third of their total funding, had declined by around 15 basis points since the cash rate reduction in August and were expected to decline further as the cost of new issuance remained below the cost of outstanding debt. Australian banks' bond issuance had been soft in September but strong in 2016 overall. ", " About half of the August cash rate reduction had been passed through to housing and business lending rates. Members noted that financial market pricing indicated that market participants expected virtually no chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the October meeting. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " A number of risks had continued to weigh on the global financial system. In China, debt had continued to expand despite slower economic growth, and banks' non-performing loan ratios had been rising. Members made the general observation that levels of leverage that previously seemed sustainable could pose risks as economic growth slows. Slow growth had also been hampering European banks from recovering from an unfavourable mix of low profitability, high non-performing loan ratios and weak equity prices. Although capital levels at European banks had been rising, some banks were still in a weak financial position, especially in Italy. In Japan, as well as Europe, low or negative interest rates had been squeezing bank profits. More broadly, low interest rates had been boosting asset prices globally, including prices of commercial property. ", " Domestic risks to financial stability had continued to shift to commercial property and areas dependent on the resources sector. Members noted that some risks from household lending had lessened a little further over the past six months. Lending standards had been strengthened and housing credit growth had slowed. The level of non-performing mortgage loans had risen over 2016 to date, but remained low. The household debt-to-income ratio was high and drifting up, although most other indicators suggested that household finances were in reasonable shape. ", " Risks around the projected large increases in supply in some inner-city apartment markets had increased. In commercial property markets more generally yields had continued to fall. Conditions were weak in Brisbane and Perth, because demand for office space from resource-related firms had declined; in contrast, the Sydney and Melbourne markets were much stronger. Non-performing business loan ratios had picked up a little, largely driven by loans to firms linked to the resources sector. Members noted that there had been few signs of stress in most other parts of the business sector. ", " The Australian banking system had continued to perform well despite these risks. In many respects, banks had become more resilient over the previous year or so by raising capital and rebalancing their businesses away from some less profitable activities overseas. They had also taken a more cautious and selective approach to domestic business lines, such as lending to property developers. This business had been growing quickly in recent years, particularly at local branches of banks with headquarters in Asia. Capital ratios had remained high. Members noted that it would be important that banks' efforts to maintain current levels of profitability did not result in increased systemic risk. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Overall, developments in the global economy had been slightly more positive leading up to the meeting. Although the Chinese economy was still facing a difficult transition, growth in China appeared to have stabilised and demand for commodities had been resilient. At the same time, some reduction in the supply of commodities had contributed to an increase in commodity prices since the turn of the year. This had supported a rise in Australia's terms of trade around the middle of this year. Members observed that the forecast stabilisation in the terms of trade around current levels would see an end to the drag on incomes from the persistent decline in the terms of trade over recent years. Globally, inflation remained below most central bank targets and monetary policy settings were very stimulatory. ", " Over the past year, the Australian economy had continued its transition following the end of the mining investment boom. Over the year to the June quarter, GDP growth had been a little above estimates of potential, driven mainly by growth in resource exports that had been stronger than expected a year earlier. Growth in the June quarter had been more moderate than in the March quarter. Recent data were consistent with further moderate growth in the September quarter. This implied that, in year-ended terms, growth was expected to decline somewhat in the near term before rising gradually. ", " There remained a degree of uncertainty about the momentum in the labour market. While the unemployment rate had edged down a little further in previous months, broader measures of labour underutilisation had not declined. This was consistent with part-time work having accounted for all of the increase in employment over the year to date and the relative strength of the household services sector, which employs a higher-than-average share of part-time workers. National accounts data had provided some further tentative evidence that growth in employee earnings had stabilised. This was consistent with less downward pressure on earnings associated with the movement of labour from mining to the non-mining sectors of the economy. ", " Conditions in the housing market had been mixed over prior months. The effects of tighter lending standards had been apparent in indicators such as the shares of interest-only loans and loans with high loan-to-valuation ratios in new lending, both of which had declined over the past year. Turnover had declined and housing credit growth had been steady at a noticeably lower rate than a year earlier. Although the rate of increase in housing prices had been lower than a year earlier, growth in housing prices and auction clearance rates had strengthened in Sydney and Melbourne in the months leading up to the meeting. Members noted that considerable supply of apartments was scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Overall, members assessed that while the risks associated with rapid growth in housing prices and lending had receded over the past year, developments would need to be monitored closely. ", " Since the September meeting, the data on the domestic economy had been broadly consistent with the forecasts presented in the August <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. The adjustment to the decline in mining investment was well advanced; headwinds from that adjustment and the earlier fall in the terms of trade appeared to be waning. The adjustment had been assisted by low interest rates, which had been supporting domestic demand. In addition, the lower exchange rate since 2013 had been helping the traded sector, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this. There was a reasonable prospect of sustaining growth in economic activity that would support further employment growth and, in time, a gradual increase in wage growth and inflation. At the same time, however, there remained considerable uncertainty about momentum in the labour and housing markets. ", " Members noted that data on CPI inflation for the September quarter and an update of the forecasts would be available at the next meeting. This would provide an opportunity to consider the economic outlook, assess the effects of previous reductions in the cash rate and review conditions in the labour and housing markets. Taking account of developments since the previous meeting, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 1 November 2016"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Chris Ryan (Acting Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by considering how outcomes over recent years had differed from earlier forecasts, noting that the differences for key variables, including inflation, the unemployment rate and GDP growth, had been modest by historical standards. Commodity prices and the terms of trade, though, had fallen by more than expected over this period, partly because global commodity production had been more resilient and demand, particularly from China, had been lower than expected. The staff's analysis also indicated that the spillovers from falling commodity prices and the associated declines in mining investment had been larger than expected over this period. At the same time, wage growth had generally been lower than implied by its historical relationship with the unemployment rate. The decline in wage growth had been a helpful part of the adjustment of the economy to the end of the resources boom. The depreciation of the Australian dollar was also helpful, although that had occurred later and was somewhat less than inferred by its historical relationship with the terms of trade. ", " Turning to the latest forecasts, which were little changed from those presented three months earlier, members observed that bulk commodity prices had increased significantly since the beginning of 2016. Consequently, the terms of trade had risen for the first time in two and a half years and had been revised higher over the forecast period. Members noted, however, that there was significant uncertainty about the outlook for the terms of trade, partly because of uncertainty about the outlook for the Chinese economy. ", " As expected, Australia's GDP growth appeared to have moderated around the middle of the year following strong growth in the March quarter. GDP growth was expected to decline in year-ended terms before increasing to be above potential growth later in the forecast period. Growth in resource exports was forecast to continue to make a significant contribution to output growth, while the drag on growth from falling mining investment was projected to diminish. Growth in non-mining activity was expected to continue at around an average pace. ", " Consumption growth had been below average in the June quarter, consistent with slower growth in retail sales. Since then, retail sales growth appeared to have remained modest, although measures of consumer sentiment regarding personal finances had risen and were clearly above average. Despite this, consumption was expected to continue making a large contribution to growth in overall expenditure over the forecast period and to grow faster than household disposable income, which implied a further gradual decline in the saving ratio. Members noted that there was significant uncertainty about the outlook for consumption growth given uncertainty about households' expectations of their income growth and the influence of these expectations on their spending and saving decisions. This was particularly pronounced for households with significant debt. ", " The value of building approvals had reached record levels as a share of GDP and the amount of work in the pipeline had edged higher, suggesting that dwelling investment would support growth for some time yet. Conditions in established housing markets had continued to diverge across the country. Housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne had increased noticeably since earlier in the year. Members noted that high and rising population growth in Victoria, which reflected population inflows from both overseas and other parts of Australia, had supported conditions in Melbourne's housing market. In contrast, housing market conditions had been particularly weak in Perth, where population growth had declined from earlier high rates, rental vacancy rates had risen and rents had fallen. Nationally, housing credit growth had remained lower than a year earlier at around 6 per cent per annum, although loan approvals to investors had picked up over recent months. ", " Members observed that revisions to the annual national accounts data for the preceding few years had been minimal for most key aggregates, including consumption and business investment. However, some business investment had been ‘reclassified’ from the non-mining sector to the mining sector. The new data suggested that mining investment had peaked at a higher level than previously recorded and that non-mining business investment had declined a little in the lead-up to the peak in mining investment. Subsequently, non-mining business investment had recorded modest growth, in contrast to the earlier vintage of data, which had implied no growth in non-mining business investment over the preceding few years. The revisions to non-mining investment were more consistent with survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation, which had been on an upward trend for some time and above their long-run averages over the preceding two years. ", " Recent data confirmed that employment growth had been concentrated in part-time employment and had continued to decline over recent months. In addition, the participation rate had fallen to levels last seen in late 2014. Members noted that the current experience of relatively strong growth in part-time employment (compared with full-time employment) was unusual insofar as such a pattern was typically associated with rising unemployment rates. While the unemployment rate had declined in previous months and over the previous year, the underemployment rate had remained elevated. Members noted that the degree of spare capacity in the labour market depended on how many additional hours workers were seeking and that relevant data were not readily available. ", " The unemployment rate was expected to edge lower, which was little changed from the outlook presented three months earlier. The forecasts incorporated a small downward revision to the outlook for both employment growth and the level of the participation rate, largely to reflect recent data and information from forward-looking indicators, which pointed to modest employment growth in the months ahead. Members observed that there was uncertainty about the degree of spare capacity in the labour market and how this might ultimately affect inflationary pressures. ", " Members noted that the earlier forecasts had over-predicted wage growth since 2011. This in part reflected the fact that there had been more spare capacity in the labour market than forecast in the years immediately following the end of the resources boom and that commodity prices had fallen by more than expected. Members also noted, however, that many advanced economies had experienced lower-than-expected wage growth, even those considered to be close to full employment. More recently, there had been evidence that wage growth in Australia had stabilised and that the effect on aggregate measures of labour costs of workers moving from mining-related activities to lower-paying jobs in the non-mining sector might almost have run its course. Members discussed the joint analytical work conducted by the Bank and the Australian Bureau of Statistics on micro-level wage price index data, which showed that a significant fall in the proportion of jobs receiving wage increases of more than 4 per cent had been part of the explanation of lower aggregate wage growth. ", " Underlying inflation had remained around 1½ per cent in year-ended terms in the September quarter, much as had been expected. Headline inflation was 1.3 per cent, with a notable contribution from fruit and vegetable prices in the September quarter. Petrol prices had subtracted from CPI inflation over the year, but were expected to add a little to headline inflation in the December quarter. The recent CPI data had confirmed that domestic cost pressures remained subdued, which was particularly evident in prices of market services. Also, rental inflation had remained very low and there had been a broad-based decline in growth in dwelling construction costs, which was somewhat at odds with the strength of housing construction in many parts of the country. The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) had fallen slightly in the September quarter but were unchanged over the year. ", " Members observed that there had been little change to the underlying inflation forecast. Underlying inflation was expected to remain at around 1½ per cent over 2016, before rising to 1½–2½ per cent by the end of the forecast period. Growth in labour costs was expected to increase gradually over the forecast period, consistent with further gradual improvements in the labour market and the end of the drag on growth from falling mining investment and the earlier decline in the terms of trade. Moreover, the disinflationary effect from heightened retail competition was expected to dissipate over time. On the other hand, low rental inflation was expected to persist – reflecting the strength of additions to the housing stock – while the boost to the prices of tradable items from the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate was likely to have run its course. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Growth in Australia's major trading partners had been a little below average over the prior year. Growth was expected to decline a little over the following two years, much as had been expected three months earlier. In large part this reflected the expectation that growth in China would gradually ease further. In contrast, output in the major advanced economies was expected to grow at a little above estimates of potential growth. Inflationary pressures in the advanced economies were expected to rise gradually as spare capacity in labour and product markets declined and the drag from earlier declines in oil prices, and commodity prices more generally, dissipated. Members noted that, following a long period of low global inflationary pressures, the risks to inflation appeared to be more balanced. ", " The downside risks to growth in China in the near term had diminished somewhat because conditions in the property market had improved, supported by rapid growth of housing prices and credit, and there had been strong growth in government-funded infrastructure projects. Although the growth in construction activity had supported an increase in production in industries that supply construction materials, including steel, there was still overcapacity in some parts of the industrial sector and growth in private sector fixed asset investment had remained subdued. At the same time, the authorities had restricted the domestic production of bulk commodities, which had contributed to a rise in coal prices. Higher commodity prices had been associated with a more broadly based increase in producer prices in China over recent months, following a few years of noticeable deflation. Members observed that the longer-term risks to China's economy associated with high and rising debt remained. ", " In the major advanced economies, growth had continued to be supported by accommodative monetary policy and labour market conditions had improved further. Consumption growth had continued to support the recoveries in the United States and the euro area. Inflation had remained below most central banks' targets to varying degrees, although the rise in commodity prices in previous months, particularly for oil, implied some upward pressure on headline inflation. Members noted that core inflation was only a little below the target of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). More positive economic data in previous months had led to markets pricing in a higher probability of an increase in the US policy rate before the end of the year. Inflation in the euro area had remained below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB), although economists' long-run inflation expectations appeared to have remained relatively well anchored. In contrast, core inflation and inflation expectations had declined in Japan, despite the historically low unemployment rate. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members observed that financial markets had been fairly quiet over the prior month. ", " Market expectations for a rise in the US federal funds rate had increased over the previous month and the minutes from the September meeting of the FOMC had revealed that most members saw the case for a rate increase as having strengthened in the preceding months. Market pricing indicated strong expectations of a rate rise in December. The ECB had left policy rates unchanged at its October meeting and indicated that it would discuss the outcome of the review of its asset purchase program at its December meeting. Market observers expected the program to be extended beyond the scheduled end-date of ‘at least March 2017’. Members noted that the Bank of Japan meeting was being held at the same time as the Reserve Bank Board meeting, with its policy announcement scheduled for later in the day. Market expectations of a further easing in policy by the Bank of England had been wound back, partly reflecting more encouraging economic data. ", " After falling throughout the first half of 2016, government bond yields in the major economies had been rising during the second half of the year, although they remained at low levels. A scaling back of expectations for central bank asset purchases, together with stronger data and higher inflation expectations, had contributed to the pick-up in yields. Credit market conditions remained favourable for most corporations, with corporate bond spreads in most of the major economies having narrowed recently, partly reflecting more encouraging economic data. Members noted that the cost of borrowing US dollars in money markets had fallen a little in October following the implementation of new regulations for US money market funds. ", " Share prices for banks in the major share markets of the United States and Europe had outperformed the broader indices over prior months, following some improvement in profit results. ", " The US dollar exchange rate had appreciated a little in October, with the movement having been broadly based against the major currencies. The Japanese yen and UK pound had depreciated on a trade-weighted basis, while the euro and Chinese renminbi had been little changed in trade-weighted terms. Members noted that the sharp depreciation of the UK pound on 7 October had been short lived and had not been accompanied by any other volatility in currency markets. The Australian dollar exchange rate had been little changed since the October meeting. ", " Australian government bond yields had increased by around 40 basis points in October, in line with developments in bond markets overseas. Yields remained low and the issuance of a 30-year bond for the first time had been well received both domestically and abroad. ", " Australian banks' bond issuance had been around average in October but had been strong in 2016 overall. In contrast, issuance of Australian non-financial corporate bonds had been relatively low in 2016, reflecting little issuance by resource firms. Yields for both banks' and non-financial corporates' bonds had remained very low. ", " Australian share prices declined in October to be little changed from the beginning of 2016. However, prices of resource stocks had increased, reflecting a strengthening earnings outlook in line with the rise in commodity prices. Financials' share prices had also risen a little. Overall, dividends had declined, driven by the resources sector, while banks' dividends had increased. ", " There had been little change to bank deposit rates in October, with the exception of some reversals of previous increases in term deposit rates by the major banks. The cost of banks' funding sourced from wholesale debt markets had declined by almost 20 basis points since the August cash rate reduction and was expected to decline further as the cost of new issuance remained below the cost of outstanding debt. There had been little change to housing or business lending rates in October. ", " Members noted that financial market pricing indicated that market participants expected virtually no chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the November meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the run of international and domestic data over the past few months had been consistent with earlier expectations and there had been little change to the forecasts since they were presented in the August <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. ", " The global economy was continuing to grow at a lower-than-average pace. The steadying of economic conditions in China had reduced some of the downside risks to the global growth outlook in the near term and had been accompanied by an increase in commodity prices. The turn-around in commodity prices since the beginning of 2016 had underpinned an increase in Australia's terms of trade and the outlook for the terms of trade had been revised a little higher. Members noted that this was a marked change from the pattern of downward revisions to the forecast for the terms of trade over the previous few years and implied a more positive outlook for nominal growth in the Australian economy. ", " Higher commodity prices and expectations that growth in the major advanced economies would exceed potential growth suggested that the risks to the global inflation outlook were more balanced than they had been for some time. However, inflation remained below most central banks' targets and monetary policy settings were expected to remain accommodative. Government bond yields had risen, but were still low by historical standards. Globally, financial markets had continued to function effectively and funding costs had remained low. ", " The domestic economy appeared to have continued growing at a moderate pace in the September quarter and the transition of activity from the mining sector to non-mining sector of the economy had continued. Low interest rates had been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 had been helping the traded sector. These factors were continuing to assist the economy to make the necessary adjustments, although it was noted that an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this adjustment. GDP growth in year-ended terms was expected to be close to estimates of potential growth over the next few quarters and then to rise to be a little above potential growth thereafter. The unemployment rate had declined over the previous year and was expected to continue to edge lower over the forecast period. Considerable uncertainty remained about the strength of labour market conditions and the implications for labour cost growth. Underlying inflation had remained low in the September quarter, much as had been expected, and was expected to pick up gradually over the forecast period. Members observed that some indicators of domestic inflation cost pressures, such as growth in the wage price index, had stabilised, albeit at low levels, and that underlying inflation was expected to return to more normal levels over time. The overall assessment was that the risks around the inflation forecast were broadly balanced. ", " Members noted that assessing conditions in the housing market had become more complicated. While overall conditions had eased relative to 2015, some indicators had strengthened over the previous few months. In particular, housing price growth had picked up noticeably in Sydney and Melbourne. However, housing turnover and growth in housing credit both remained lower than a year earlier, consistent with the supervisory measures that had been taken to tighten lending standards and the more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. In addition, a considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next few years, particularly in the eastern capital cities, and growth in rents in the September quarter was the slowest for some decades. ", " Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

The pick-up had been broadly based geographically. Survey measures suggested that conditions in the manufacturing sectors of Australia's largest trading partners had continued to improve; conditions in the services sectors of the major advanced economies had remained favourable. The strength of industrial production in the high-income economies of east Asia had been associated with very strong growth in exports of electronics, specifically of semiconductors. The strength of demand in electronics-related industries had supported business investment and GDP growth in the region, particularly in South Korea. ", " GDP growth in the major advanced economies had been above potential, supported by accommodative monetary policies. Members noted that recent growth outcomes for the euro area had been stronger than expected. Growth in business investment had picked up in the major advanced economies over the prior year and further solid growth was anticipated over coming quarters. Consumption growth had remained above average, supported by robust growth in employment. ", " Conditions in labour markets in a number of major advanced economies had continued to tighten. Employment-to-population ratios had increased and unemployment rates had declined to low levels in Japan, Germany and the United States, among other advanced economies. Members noted that this implied there was limited spare capacity in these economies, based on conventional measures of full employment. However, wage growth had picked up only slightly. While observing that there were typically lags between labour markets tightening and wage pressures emerging, members noted that the wage data might suggest these economies had more spare capacity than implied by conventional measures. More generally, members noted that the nature of work was evolving, driven partly by technological change, and that not everyone was benefiting equally from the recent strength in labour demand. Low wage outcomes had contributed to core inflation in the major advanced economies remaining low, even though producer price inflation had been noticeably higher. ", " In China, GDP growth had been stronger than expected over the first three quarters of 2017, but more recently growth looked to have eased. This was particularly true of residential construction activity in cities where the authorities had implemented policies to address buoyant housing market conditions. The output of some sectors producing inputs for the construction sector, such as glass and steel products, had fallen in preceding months. Production shutdowns designed to deal with environmental concerns had also affected crude steel production. In combination, these factors had led to some levelling off of Chinese bulk commodity imports, including from Australia. Despite this, spot prices for iron ore had increased over the previous month and Chinese producer price inflation had remained elevated, partly reflecting stronger commodity prices. Although consumer price inflation in China had edged higher, it remained below the authorities' objective of 3 per cent in 2017. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the wage price index continued to suggest that wage growth had been stable at a low rate. The outcome for the September quarter had been slightly lower than expected, despite the 3.3 per cent increase in award and minimum wages in the quarter, as previously determined by the Fair Work Commission. (The award system directly covers around one-quarter of the workforce.) Wage growth in the health and education sectors remained above the national average and a number of sectors had seen an increase in year-ended wage growth compared with a year prior. This had occurred at the same time as spare capacity appeared to have declined and more firms had been reporting difficulty finding suitable labour. The forecast was still for wage growth to increase gradually over the next year or so. ", " Labour market conditions had remained positive and had been stronger than expected over the previous year. Employment had increased a little in October and growth over the previous year had been well above average. Full-time employment had risen sharply and was growing at around its fastest pace in a decade. The participation rate was notably higher than a year earlier, particularly for women and older workers, who had been staying in the labour force for longer. The unemployment rate had edged lower to be 5.4 per cent in October, which was its lowest level since 2013, and unemployment rates had been on a downward trend in most states. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand suggested employment growth would be somewhat above average over the next few quarters. ", " Members noted that the September quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting and that recent data suggested GDP growth over the year to the September quarter was likely to have picked up to around the economy's potential growth rate. ", " Information on components of household consumption indicated that growth in aggregate household consumption had moderated in the September quarter; growth in retail sales volumes and motor vehicle sales to households had been subdued. The growth in the value of retail sales in October was consistent with reports from the Bank's liaison suggesting that moderate growth in consumption had continued into the December quarter. ", " Dwelling investment was expected to have fallen marginally in the September quarter. Dwelling investment had fallen over the preceding year in Queensland and Western Australia, but had remained at a high level in New South Wales and Victoria. Residential building approvals had picked up in preceding months, but remained below the levels of a few years earlier. Together with data on the pipeline of work yet to be done, this suggested that dwelling investment would remain at a high level for the following year or so, but that it was not likely to add materially to GDP growth. ", " Conditions had eased in the established housing market, most noticeably in Sydney, where housing prices had declined in prior months and auction clearance rates had fallen. Housing price growth had also eased in Melbourne, but remained relatively strong, supported by high population growth. Housing prices in Perth and Brisbane had been little changed in preceding months. ", " Members observed that business conditions in the non-mining sector had been above average for most industries over the preceding year or so and that non-mining profits had been increasing. Non-mining business investment looked to have risen further in the September quarter and the prospects for continued growth were positive: investment intentions had been revised higher, particularly for the business services sector; survey measures of capacity utilisation had remained well above average; and private non-residential building approvals had remained strong. Mining investment looked to have been little changed in the September quarter, although declines were still anticipated over the next few quarters. ", " Growth in public investment had picked up over the preceding few years, driven by infrastructure investment. Further growth was expected over the following couple of years, based on projections in state and federal budgets. Members considered macroeconomic modelling of a scenario under which public investment was higher than forecast for the following three years. The demand effects of this scenario included the direct contribution to GDP growth of higher public investment, as well as the multiplier effects through higher profits earned by private sector firms and the higher incomes earned by workers on these projects. Members noted the possibility of ‘crowding out’ of other forms of demand, but did not consider this a major risk given that the economy was currently operating with a degree of spare capacity and inflation was low. Indeed, a sustained pick-up in spending on public infrastructure could even ‘crowd in’ additional investment by the private sector firms undertaking those projects on the public sector's behalf. Members also noted that the higher level of infrastructure investment could boost productivity in the economy. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members noted that conditions in financial markets generally had been little changed over the previous month, with volatility having remained at a low level throughout 2017. Financial conditions generally remained very accommodative, despite the gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus in some economies over 2017. However, there had been a noticeable tightening in financial market conditions in China over the year, including in response to regulatory measures. ", " Market pricing suggested that market participants expected the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to increase the federal funds rate at its December meeting, consistent with the median of FOMC members' projections. However, market pricing continued to suggest a more modest increase in the federal funds rate over 2018 than implied by the median FOMC projection. Members noted that previously announced changes to the composition of the FOMC had not affected market analysts' expectations regarding the stance of US monetary policy. Regulations – particularly on smaller financial institutions – were under review, although members noted that core reforms relevant to capital, liquidity, stress testing and resolution planning were likely to be preserved. ", " Members observed that the yield on long-term US government bonds had been little changed over preceding months, whereas the yield on shorter-term US government bonds had increased. This in part reflected expectations for an increase in the federal funds rate and the US Treasury shifting its issuance towards securities at shorter maturities. Long-term government bond yields in other major financial markets had also generally remained little changed at low levels. ", " Members noted that while yields on Australian 10-year government bonds had been little changed, their spread to US Treasury bond yields had declined to a low level over preceding months. ", " Financing conditions remained favourable for corporations across major markets. Although spreads of high-yield corporate bonds to government bonds had increased a little in November, they remained at very low levels. Also, equity valuations remained high, having risen over 2017, although there had been small declines in some markets over November. ", " There had been little change in most major exchange rates over November. The US dollar had appreciated a little since early September on a trade-weighted basis, reflecting increased prospects for both future increases in the federal funds rate and US fiscal stimulus. Members noted that while the Australian dollar had depreciated by around 5 per cent in trade-weighted terms over this period, it had moved within a relatively narrow range over the previous two and a half years and was a little higher than the level of early 2016. ", " In China, a broad range of policy actions had contributed to a tightening in financial market conditions since late 2016 and a reduction in leverage within the financial system. Recent regulatory announcements had been directed towards managing risks in the shadow banking sector. Members noted that Chinese equity valuations had risen strongly over 2017, but had fallen somewhat in November after the authorities had signalled their concern that some stocks were overvalued. ", " In Australia, housing credit growth had eased a little over the second half of 2017, as growth in lending to owner-occupiers had slowed somewhat and growth in lending to investors had stabilised at a lower level than in the first half of the year. The easing in housing credit growth had been accounted for by the major banks, which had been more affected by the need to restrain interest-only lending to comply with the supervisory measures announced earlier in the year. Growth in housing lending by non-authorised deposit-taking institutions (non-ADIs) had picked up, although these institutions' share of overall housing lending remained small. Members noted that these lenders charged higher interest rates on average than ADIs, which is likely to reflect both the borrower risk profile and higher funding costs of non-ADIs. ", " Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities, which are an important source of funding for non-ADIs, had been strong in 2017 and pricing of these securities had declined a little. Major banks' funding costs had declined a little over 2017 and long-term debt funding had grown relatively strongly in the second half of the year. ", " Members observed that the Australian equity market (on an accumulation basis) had risen in line with global markets over the previous couple of years and that volatility had remained low over the prior year. Australian share prices had been little changed over the preceding month, although banks' share prices had declined, partly in response to lower-than-expected profit increases. ", " Financial market prices continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the following year or so. ", " Members concluded their review of developments in financial markets with a detailed discussion of Australian businesses' access to finance. They noted that external finance had become available on increasingly favourable terms for large businesses over recent years, with foreign banks having added to competition for large business lending. Nevertheless, business borrowing had grown only moderately, reflecting subdued mergers and acquisitions activity, with investment having been funded largely from internal sources of funds. In contrast, many small businesses continued to find it challenging to obtain finance, particularly in their start-up or expansion phases. Members noted that this was likely to reflect the riskier nature of such lending, but also the less competitive market for small business lending. Participants on the Bank's Small Business Finance Advisory Panel, convened annually, had confirmed the challenges of accessing bank lending. Members observed that equity funding was often more appropriate for the risk profile of start-up businesses, but that there are relatively few avenues for such financing in Australia compared with some other markets. Members were encouraged by the potential for innovations to improve access to finance for small businesses and the willingness of regulators to facilitate these developments, including in the areas of comprehensive credit reporting, open banking and alternative funding platforms. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that conditions in the global economy had improved over 2017 and that the outlook had also been upgraded. This improvement had been supported by expansionary financial conditions, notwithstanding some withdrawal of monetary stimulus in a number of economies. In the major advanced economies, labour market conditions had continued to tighten, but wage growth and core inflation had remained low. Members recognised that this combination of strength in economic activity and low inflation was a central issue in the global economy. It was possible that this combination could continue for a while yet, but it was also possible that inflation could pick up by more than expected as spare capacity diminished. ", " Although the global growth outlook had improved, commodity prices and Australia's terms of trade were expected to decline in the period ahead, but to remain at relatively high levels. The Australian dollar had continued to fluctuate within its range of the preceding two and a half years. An appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in domestic economic activity and inflation than currently forecast. ", " Members noted that the low level of interest rates had been supporting the Australian economy. Recent data suggested that GDP growth had been around its trend rate over the year to the September quarter. Output growth was still expected to pick up gradually over the forecast period. Business conditions were positive and capacity utilisation had remained high. The outlook for non-mining business investment had improved further and the pick-up in public infrastructure investment was also supporting overall growth. However, growth in consumption was expected to have slowed in the September quarter and the outlook for household consumption continued to be a significant risk, given that household incomes were growing slowly and debt levels were high. ", " Growth in employment, particularly full-time employment, had increased and the unemployment rate had fallen to a four-year low. Although wage growth had been a little lower than expected in the September quarter, it appeared to have stabilised at a low rate. Leading indicators of labour demand had been broadly consistent with continuing strength in the labour market. In these circumstances, spare capacity in the labour market was expected to be absorbed gradually and wage growth was expected to pick up over time. ", " Housing market conditions had generally eased, especially in Sydney. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. To address the medium-term risks associated with high and rising household indebtedness, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority had introduced a number of supervisory measures earlier in the year and credit standards had been tightened to lower the risk profile of borrowers. Growth in household credit had slowed somewhat, but members agreed that household balance sheets still warranted careful monitoring. ", " Over the prior year or so, the unemployment rate had fallen and inflation had moved closer to target. Members noted that this had occurred at the same time as risks in household balance sheets had lessened. Recent data had increased confidence that there would be further progress on these fronts over the following year. How far and when stronger conditions in the economy and labour market might feed through into higher wage growth and inflation remained important considerations shaping the outlook. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 6 December 2016"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Ian Harper, Allan Moss AO, Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Chris Ryan (Acting Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Luci Ellis (Head, Financial Stability Department), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Secretary) "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.6 per cent in October, somewhat more than ½ percentage point below its peak in mid 2015. Despite a rise in full-time employment in October, all of the growth in employment over 2016 had been in part-time employment, with an increased share of people in the labour force reporting that they would like to work more hours. Members discussed various measures of labour underutilisation, including those that account for the number of hours sought by the unemployed and the additional hours desired by those who are underemployed (and who are also recorded as actively searching for additional hours). Such hours-based measures of underutilisation had declined to a similar extent as the unemployment rate since late 2015 and, unlike the heads-based measure, had not increased recently. ", " Wage growth had remained low and continued to be lower than implied by the historical relationship with the unemployment rate. The wage price index (WPI) had increased by a little less than expected in the September quarter and year-ended growth in the WPI had eased a little further. Although there had been some evidence from enterprise agreements that growth in construction wages had picked up recently, these agreements covered a relatively small share of the total workforce. ", " Members noted that the September quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. Based on recent data, GDP growth was likely to be weaker than expected at the time of the November <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> and lower in year-ended terms than estimates of potential growth. ", " Consumption growth was expected to have remained below average in the September quarter. The volume of retail sales, which represent around one-third of total consumption, had been little changed in the quarter, pointing to continued weakness in growth of goods consumption. In contrast, in recent months, the value of retail sales had grown at an above-average pace and liaison with retailers suggested that trading conditions had remained steady. Households' perceptions of their personal finances had remained at above-average levels. ", " Members noted that the work done on residential construction had fallen in the September quarter, suggesting that the national accounts measure of dwelling investment was likely to have declined in the same period. Although residential building approvals had declined sharply in October, the significant amount of work in the pipeline  suggested that the level of dwelling investment activity would remain high. Nevertheless, the contribution of dwelling investment to growth was expected to decline over the forecast period. ", " Overall, conditions in the established housing market had strengthened over recent months. Members noted, however, that supply and demand conditions had continued to vary across the country. In Sydney and Melbourne, housing price inflation had picked up and auction clearance rates were at high levels. Outside of Sydney, increases in prices of apartments had generally been smaller than increases in prices of detached houses. Investor housing loan approvals had picked up noticeably and credit growth had also increased a little over recent months, particularly in New South Wales. In contrast, housing market conditions had remained weak in Perth. Rental markets had been subdued overall and continued to be particularly weak in Perth. ", " Business investment looked to have been a little weaker than expected in the September quarter. The ABS capital expenditure survey and separate data on non-residential building work done had suggested that mining investment fell in the quarter. Further falls were anticipated, but the subtraction from GDP growth in 2016/17 was expected to be smaller than in 2015/16. Capital expenditure for the non-mining activity covered by the survey, which is less than half of the activity covered in the national accounts measure of non-mining business investment, was little changed over the year to September. Capital expenditure survey data on investment intentions continued to point to a decline in non-mining investment in 2016/17. Members also noted that, over the past few years, the national accounts had tended to report slightly stronger outcomes for non-mining business investment than implied by the data on capital expenditure intentions. Non-residential building approvals had increased in recent months, but the pipeline of non-residential construction work was low. Private sector survey measures of business conditions and non-mining capacity utilisation had been above their long-run averages, but had eased since earlier in the year. ", " Export volumes increased in the September quarter, led by service exports. Prices for a number of Australia's key commodities, including coking coal, iron ore and base metals, had increased noticeably over the June and September quarters, which had contributed to the increase in Australia's terms of trade of about 6 per cent over that period. Commodity prices had risen further over November, suggesting that an increase in the terms of trade in the December quarter was likely. Oil prices had increased over recent months, partly in response to announcements by OPEC about reductions to supply. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Growth in GDP of Australia's major trading partners had picked up a bit over recent months, although growth remained a little below average. Members noted that there had been a general improvement in survey measures of global business conditions. They also noted that the downside risks to global inflation appeared to have diminished somewhat, in part because commodity prices had increased significantly over 2016 to date. Prospects for fiscal expansion in some countries had also contributed to expectations that inflation would increase. However, inflation had remained below most central banks' targets and monetary policies had continued to be accommodative. ", " Economic activity in China had continued to be supported by accommodative financial conditions and public spending, particularly on infrastructure. However, high and rising levels of debt remained a risk to the outlook over the longer term. Members observed that measures had been introduced to dampen housing price inflation in a number of cities and that this posed an additional risk that growth in housing market activity might be lower in the period ahead. Producer prices had increased over the preceding year, following declines over several years, and measures of consumer price inflation had edged higher. ", " In the United States, GDP growth had been around estimates of potential over the past year. While business investment had been weak, consumption growth had continued to be supported by strong labour market outcomes. Members noted that it was too early to know much about the effect of the outcome of the US Presidential election on the outlook for US economic activity and inflation, or the potential spillovers to other economies. There was uncertainty about the policy agenda of the incoming administration. A range of estimates suggested that the plans for fiscal policy could provide a boost to economic activity over the next few years and place some upward pressure on inflation. Working in the other direction, however, if policies were enacted to restrict trade, there could be significant adverse effects on the economic outlook in the United States and beyond. ", " Economic activity in the euro area had continued to recover. Members noted that some economies in the euro area were facing larger structural challenges than others. In Italy, the level of GDP remained lower than it had been prior to the global financial crisis, non-performing loans had remained at a high level and gross public debt was around 135 per cent of GDP.  ", " Labour market conditions had continued to tighten in most advanced economies. In the United States, this had led to a modest pick-up in nominal wage growth, but unit labour costs had been rising at an above-average rate. Growth in wages and unit labour costs had also been above average in Japan. In the United States, core inflation had been only a little below the Federal Reserve's goal during 2016, while core inflation in Japan had moderated over the course of the year to date and inflation expectations had remained relatively low. In the euro area, inflation had remained lower than the target of the European Central Bank, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations had stabilised. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that there had been some large market movements following the outcome of the US Presidential election, but that movements had been generally orderly and the increase in volatility had been short-lived. ", " US Treasury yields had risen sharply following the outcome of the US Presidential election, reflecting the assessment in financial markets that the Trump administration's policies overall were likely to boost growth and inflation, although there was considerable uncertainty around this. Sovereign bond yields had also increased in the other major economies, though by less than in the United States. Members observed that the increase in US Treasury yields, while large, was not as large as some other movements in recent decades and yields remained very low by historical standards. ", " The US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the policy rate unchanged at its November meeting. Members noted that markets had fully priced in an increase in the policy rate at the FOMC's December meeting and expected a steeper, although still gradual, path for future rate increases owing, in part, to the fiscal stimulus expected to be pursued by the Trump administration. ", " European sovereign bond spreads to German Bunds had widened ahead of the Italian referendum and upcoming elections in some other countries. There had been little movement in corporate bond spreads in the major economies in the previous month. ", " Share market indices in the United States fell immediately following the outcome of the US Presidential election, but very quickly recovered to be higher over November as a whole. The sectoral pattern of movements across US stocks reflected the expected effects of the Trump administration's policies as well as higher oil prices. In Japan, the depreciation of the yen and better-than-expected growth had contributed to a rise in share prices. European share prices had declined slightly in November. ", " Emerging market bonds and equities were generally sold off following the outcome of the US Presidential election, reflecting market expectations of a possible increase in trade protection and increased US dollar debt-servicing costs for firms in emerging market economies, given higher US yields and exchange rate depreciations against the US dollar. The depreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar was particularly marked. Several emerging market central banks had intervened in the foreign exchange market. The US dollar had also appreciated against most advanced economy currencies. A notable exception was the appreciation of the UK pound against the US dollar during November. ", " The Chinese renminbi had appreciated on a trade-weighted basis over November, but had depreciated against the US dollar. Net private sector capital outflows had increased over the September quarter and the Chinese authorities had recently introduced a number of measures to increase scrutiny of capital outflows. ", " Members noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated by 2 per cent against the US dollar since the previous meeting but had appreciated against the yen and some other Asian currencies, to be little changed on a trade-weighted basis. ", " Australian government bond yields and share prices rose in November. As in other markets, resource stocks had outperformed the broader market, reflecting higher commodity prices, while high-dividend yielding stocks had fallen owing to higher bond yields. Australian banks' bond issuance was above average in November and strong in 2016 overall. Banks had issued more longer-term bonds in recent years in response to increased demand from investors searching for yield and the forthcoming introduction of new prudential requirements. ", " Members noted that banks' deposit rates had been little changed during November. While the cost of new bond issuance had increased, it remained below that seen at the start of 2016. Some banks had announced increases to advertised lending rates, mostly for housing and in particular to investors. ", " Pricing in domestic financial markets indicated that market participants did not expect a reduction in the cash rate at the December meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy, members discussed the policy decisions made throughout the easing phase since late 2011, during which the cash rate had been lowered in aggregate by 3¼ percentage points. The lower rates had helped support the economy in the transition following the mining investment boom and, more recently, had been in response to lower-than-expected inflation. Members discussed the effect of lower interest rates on asset prices and the decisions by households to borrow, particularly given the already high levels of household debt. Over recent years the Board had sought to balance the benefits of lower interest rates in supporting growth and achieving the inflation target with the potential risks to household balance sheets. Members recognised that this balance would need to be kept under review. ", " Turning to the policy decision for the December meeting, members noted that the international environment had been more positive in recent months, while observing that significant risks to the outlook for global activity persisted. The Chinese economy had remained resilient, supported by expansionary fiscal policy and rapid growth in financing. International financial markets had interpreted the outcome of the US election, specifically the implications for infrastructure spending, as being positive for growth and inflation in the United States. At the same time, there were increased expectations that the Federal Reserve would increase policy rates at the next meeting of the FOMC. Rising commodity prices had also contributed to an assessment that the outlook for global inflation was more balanced than it had been for some time, although inflation remained below most central banks' targets. ", " Domestically, data that had become available over the previous month indicated that GDP growth in the September quarter was likely to be lower than the forecast at the time of the November <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. Year-ended growth was expected to decline before picking up to be above potential later in the forecast period, supported by low interest rates and the lower exchange rate since 2013. Members noted that these factors had assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom and that an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the adjustment. Falls in mining investment were expected to subtract less from GDP growth over time and resource exports were expected to continue to make a substantial contribution to growth. ", " There was still considerable uncertainty about the momentum in the labour market. The unemployment rate had declined over the past year, as had measures of excess capacity that accounted for the number of additional desired hours of work. Part-time employment had grown strongly over the previous year, but employment growth overall had slowed. Members noted that there was expected to be excess capacity in the labour market for some time, which was consistent with further indications of subdued labour cost pressures. This suggested that inflation would remain low for some time before returning to more normal levels. ", " Housing market conditions had strengthened overall over preceding months, although there was considerable variation across the country and between houses and apartments. Housing credit growth had picked up a little, particularly for investors. The supervisory measures that had strengthened lending standards in the housing market had led some lenders to take a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. At the same time, the increase in global bond yields had led some lenders to increase their rates on fixed-interest rate loans. ", " Taking into account the information that had become available over the previous month, and having eased monetary policy earlier in the year, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Members observed that consumer sentiment had improved, consistent with employment growth picking up to a moderate pace and better conditions in the housing market. There was still considerable uncertainty as to how, and to what extent, the ‘fiscal cliff’ in early 2013 would be addressed by policymakers. This uncertainty appeared to be weighing on business sentiment, with indicators of investment, in particular, remaining subdued.

In the other higher-income economies in east Asia, growth remained weak. However, for the lower-income economies in the region, growth remained close to long-run averages.

Several governments in the region, including those of France and Greece, had introduced additional policies to address competitiveness and fiscal challenges, although these challenges remained substantial.

Base metals prices had risen, while rural prices were little changed and iron ore prices had recorded a modest decline.

The outlook for mining investment over the remainder of the financial year had been revised down in the ABS capital expenditure survey, largely confirming the outlook based on liaison and other information that had been incorporated in the Bank's most recent forecasts. ", " Members observed that cost-cutting in the iron ore and coal industries was feeding through to related business services industries, resulting in some labour shedding. Even so, exports of iron ore had remained at a high level over recent months and coal exports from Queensland had been recovering following earlier industrial disruptions. ", " Investment outside the mining sector increased in the September quarter, although the capital expenditure survey suggested that there would be negligible growth, or even a small fall, in 2012/13 as a whole. Members noted that survey measures of business conditions had generally declined further and measures of capacity utilisation were a bit below average, with the Bank's liaison suggesting that some firms were investing only to cover the depreciation of existing capital. Members noted that there was also concern in the non-residential construction industry about the modest pipeline of work once the existing wave of committed resource projects was completed. While growth in credit to unincorporated businesses continued at a measured pace in recent months, growth of business credit overall had slowed. ", " Forward-looking indicators of residential construction over recent months, including building approvals, continued to point to a modest recovery in that sector over the period ahead. This was likely to be supported by the pick-up in dwelling prices, sales activity and rental yields over recent months. In addition, loan approvals had moved a little higher since the middle of the year. ", " Several indicators suggested that consumption growth had slowed in the September quarter, following the impetus to sales from heavy discounting and government payments in the first half of the year. After declining in July, the value of retail sales rose in August and September, but was unchanged in October. Measures of consumer sentiment had picked up a little in recent months to be a bit above average. ", " Employment in October continued to expand at a modest pace and the unemployment rate remained at 5.4 per cent, slightly above its level earlier in the year. Leading indicators and information from the Bank's liaison contacts suggested that labour demand had softened, which pointed to only modest employment growth in coming months. ", " As expected, the pace of wage growth eased in the September quarter. The slowing had been most pronounced in the household services and retail sectors. Business surveys and information from liaison suggested that businesses across of a range of industries anticipated an easing in wage pressures in the period ahead. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members began their discussion on financial markets with the observation that most markets had been relatively steady over the past month, despite uncertainty about fiscal negotiations in the United States and the Greek bailout package. The agreement on Greece's financial aid package reached late in November provided only a small boost to markets, as most participants expected that further concessions would be needed. Despite the fact that Spain was yet to request financial assistance, yields on Spanish and other peripheral euro area sovereign debt had remained close to the levels reached after the European Central Bank's Outright Monetary Transactions program was announced in September. ", " Members observed that the primary markets for corporate debt globally were strong, with issuers benefiting from record low yields in many markets. Financial institutions generally had been less active issuers of debt securities in recent months. In Australia, issuance of bonds by corporates had reached a new high during 2012, as bond yields domestically also declined to record low levels. For the Australian banks, the focus remained on raising deposits, although there were signs that competition in some deposit markets was beginning to ease.

Mining investment had made a further contribution to growth in the September quarter (although the outlook had softened a little further). There were also tentative signs that dwelling investment was turning up, but the outlook for non-mining investment overall in the year ahead remained subdued. ", " For inflation to remain contained, ongoing productivity growth and a further sustained moderation in wage growth would be needed. Recent data indicated that, to date, there had been a small decline in the growth of wages, which was consistent with the softening in the labour market seen over the past year. The forward-looking labour market indicators had generally declined recently, suggesting that employment growth would remain modest in the months ahead. ", " Following earlier decisions, lending rates were now clearly below their medium-term averages, although they remained above the levels reached in 2009. Some of the expected effects were starting to be observed and further effects could be anticipated over time. At the Board's previous meeting, members had considered that further easing may be appropriate in the period ahead, but had decided to maintain the existing setting for the time being, in view of the slightly higher-than-expected September quarter CPI and somewhat better information about the world economy. ", " At this meeting, the information on labour costs and softening labour market conditions suggested that the inflation outlook still afforded the Board some scope to provide additional support to demand. Further confirmation that the peak in resource sector investment was near, and that the short-term outlook for non-resource investment remained subdued, indicated that there was a case for the Board to provide that support. The Board considered whether to respond to this case in the near term or wait for further information. On balance, members saw merit in reducing the cash rate at this meeting. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.00 per cent, effective 5 December. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 5 October 2010"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Chairman and Governor), Ric Battellino (Deputy Governor), Ken Henry AC (Secretary to the Treasury), John Akehurst, Jillian Broadbent AO, Donald McGauchie AO ", " Members granted leave of absence to Roger Corbett AO, Graham Kraehe AO and Warwick McKibbin in terms of section 18A of the <cite>Reserve Bank Act 1959</cite>. "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Philip Lowe (Assistant Governor, Economic), Tony Richards (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Acting Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" On balance, recent data on the global economy had been broadly in line with expectations. The central scenario remained for the world economy to continue to grow at around trend pace over the next year or so, with growth expected to remain relatively strong in the emerging economies but subdued in most of the large advanced economies. ", " In Asia, growth had eased from the very rapid pace recorded in the second half of 2009 and the early part of this year. While export growth across much of the region had been weak over recent months, indicators of domestic demand had remained firm. ", " In China, the data for August had mostly been stronger than for June and July. Household spending remained strong; members noted the significant increase in passenger vehicle sales, which had continued to rise even following the partial unwinding of the incentives that had been in place in 2009. Members noted there were signs that the cooling of the Chinese residential property market may have run its course, with turnover increasing after the earlier sharp falls, though prices had remained broadly flat. Members observed that the authorities had recently announced a number of new measures to reduce the flow of lending for housing, especially for investment properties. ", " Growth appeared to be slowing in Japan. Activity was continuing to expand in the other higher-income economies in Asia; retail sales were growing strongly and employment was expanding. Property markets had also been strong in a number of these economies, most notably Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan; this reflected real interest rates that were very low, and in some cases negative, despite the strong economic growth in the region. Policy-makers in these economies had also responded by tightening credit for housing. ", " The US economy was continuing to grow, but the pace had clearly slowed. While recent data had been a little more positive than over the previous couple of months, the risks still appeared to be tilted to the downside. Consumer confidence was low and the housing and labour markets remained weak. Members noted that the sharp fall in housing prices and the earlier run-up in debt had resulted in a significant increase in the gearing of the housing stock, which suggested that the process of repairing household balance sheets would be protracted. In contrast, conditions in the business sector were more favourable and business investment was now recovering after falling to multi-decade lows as a share of GDP. Members observed that the durability of the pick-up in investment was uncertain given the subdued outlook for household spending and the need for significant fiscal consolidation in the medium term. ", " In Europe, there had been further evidence of the disparity in economic performance and prospects across countries. Conditions remained strongest in Germany, with consumer and business confidence at relatively high levels, and weakest in the smaller economies that were facing fiscal problems. Members discussed conditions in Ireland, which had seen renewed focus on its fiscal position following the need for further capital injections into the banking system. The recent weakness followed a period of around 15 years of strong output growth, accompanied by high levels of property construction and credit growth, and unit labour cost growth that had run ahead of most other euro area economies. The unemployment rate had risen from 5 per cent in early 2008 to around 13 per cent. Output had contracted in 11 of the past 13 quarters, for a cumulative fall of 12 per cent, and property prices had fallen sharply. This, together with problems in the banking sector, had led to increased concerns about Ireland's public debt dynamics. ", " Given the ongoing strength in China and the rest of emerging Asia, spot prices for bulk commodities had been broadly stable at high levels, while prices for rural products, gold and base metals had all risen recently. Following the increases in the contract prices for bulk commodities in the June and September quarters, initial information suggested that contract prices for the December quarter were around 5 per cent to 15 per cent lower, which was broadly in line with staff forecasts. Overall, after rising to around record high levels in the June quarter, Australia's terms of trade were estimated to have increased further in the September quarter, but were then expected to decline gradually. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" There had been only a relatively limited amount of data on the domestic economy over the past month. ", " The labour market remained strong, with employment estimated to have increased by 31,000 in August and the unemployment rate falling back to 5.1 per cent. Over the year, employment had grown by around 3 per cent, with total hours worked increasing at a faster pace, reflecting an increase in average hours worked. Forward-looking indicators pointed to continued growth in labour demand, though perhaps at a more moderate pace, with some business surveys reporting an easing in hiring intentions. Members discussed the current state of the labour market and the implications for wage growth and inflation. The various indicators provided slightly different pictures of the extent of labour market tightness. While the unemployment rate was around the level it had been in late 2004 and early 2005, the ABS measure of the number of vacancies suggested a somewhat tighter labour market, whereas business surveys suggested that most firms were not experiencing significant difficulties finding labour. ", " Liaison with retailers suggested that household spending had strengthened a little over recent months, and the ABS data that were released during the meeting showed moderate growth in retail spending in August. While consumer confidence remained at a high level, most retailers continued to report that consumers remained cautious, somewhat at odds with the latest national accounts, which had suggested that overall spending grew strongly in the June quarter. The cautiousness of the household sector was perhaps most evident on the financial side, with growth in mortgage debt slowing over recent months and credit card debt broadly flat thus far in 2010. ", " This slowdown in the pace of borrowing by households had been accompanied by a cooling in the established housing market, with measures of nationwide housing prices down slightly over recent months and auction clearance rates closer to average than in the early part of the year. Members observed that cooling in the market and the slowing in borrowing was a welcome development given the significant longer-term run-up in prices and household debt. They observed that there were some signs that the rental market was tightening again, with vacancy rates in some states declining from levels that were already quite low. The tightness in the rental market was likely to persist given the ongoing strong population growth and the decline in housing approvals this year, and could be expected to feed into increases in rents. Approvals for construction of apartments remained at low levels in most states, with Victoria a clear exception. ", " Business investment was expected to strengthen over the next few years and to offset the scaling back in public investment. Most business surveys continued to report that current conditions, capacity utilisation and confidence were at, or above, average levels. In addition, the Bank's liaison program provided some early signs that investment was starting to pick up, although recent indicators still showed a mixed picture. The pipeline of engineering work to be done was at a very high level, although non-residential building approvals remained low. It was also noteworthy that business credit had fallen in July and August after a period when it had been broadly flat. Members discussed the factors behind the subdued level of lending to businesses, which was most apparent in lending to larger businesses, with lending to small businesses expanding at an annualised rate of 6 per cent in the first eight months of 2010. Members observed that the low level of new bank lending at present partly reflected the ample availability of internally generated funds, given that the profit share of GDP was at a high level in both the mining and non-mining sectors, and good access to equity funding and non-bank financing from the capital markets. ", " Conditions in the farm sector had improved significantly. Rainfall for the year to date had been good over most of the country, though the cropping areas of Western Australia had experienced below-average rainfall. Forecasts for the 2010 wheat crop had been raised recently, and the farm sector was expected to contribute significantly to GDP growth in 2010/11. ", " There had been little new information on price and wage inflation over the past month. Measures of inflation expectations were relatively close to average levels. The September quarter CPI would be released on 27 October. A year-ended increase of around 3 per cent, with underlying inflation around 2½–2¾ per cent, would be consistent with the central forecast scenario. "], "Financial Markets": [" Ireland had been the focal point of concerns in financial markets over the past month. Members noted that periods of acute stress in the euro area were likely to recur for some time to come. ", " The Irish Government was in the process of dismantling Anglo Irish Bank, which had previously received sizable capital injections from the Government. Members were informed that the fiscal position of the Irish Government appeared to be worsening, notwithstanding the austerity package that had been put in place. These developments had led to a rise in Irish sovereign spreads to over 450 basis points. ", " Yields on government bonds in the major countries rose from their low levels in September in response to the announcements of capital requirements for global banks that were less stringent than expected and some positive economic data from the United States and China. However, yields fell again later in the month following indications of further monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve and renewed concerns over the smaller European countries. Longer-term government bond yields in Australia had not fallen as much as elsewhere given the relatively better macroeconomic environment, which had led to a widening of the spread to US Treasuries to around a two-decade high. Nevertheless, members noted that domestic yields remained at low levels. ", " On monetary policy, members noted that a number of central banks, including those in Canada, India and Sweden, had continued on their tightening path. In contrast, the Federal Reserve indicated that it was seriously considering further quantitative easing and had started to reinvest the proceeds of maturing mortgage-backed securities into Treasuries. The Bank of Japan was meeting on the same day, and market expectations were for further easing there also. ", " The prospect of further monetary stimulus had seen the US dollar depreciate against most currencies over the past month. As a result, the yen rose to a 15-year high in nominal terms, prompting the Japanese authorities to intervene in the market for the first time since 2004. The initial result of the intervention was a 3 per cent depreciation of the yen, but subsequently the yen reversed most of this depreciation. Members noted that the period of deflation over several years in Japan implied that the real effective exchange rate of the yen was in the middle of the range of the past few decades. ", " The US Congress had increased its pressure on the Chinese authorities to appreciate the renminbi, proposing retaliatory legislation against Chinese imports. The renminbi had been allowed to appreciate again, following a period of relative stability since the initial change to the exchange rate regime in June. However, on a trade-weighted basis, the renminbi had depreciated further, given the depreciation of the US dollar against many currencies. ", " The Australian dollar had appreciated by almost 4 per cent over the past month, to be near multi-decade highs against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. Members noted that the appreciation of the exchange rate represented a tightening of domestic financial conditions. They were briefed on changes to the weights in the trade-weighted index, with these updated annually to reflect changes in Australia's merchandise trade patterns. The main change in the past year had been another large increase in the weight of the renminbi in the index. ", " Notwithstanding the market concerns over conditions in Ireland, equity markets rose solidly over the past month, reversing the decline of the previous month. However, equity markets were little changed over the past year. ", " Global credit market conditions had generally been stable with solid issuance, including by sub-investment-grade issuers in the United States. ", " In the Australian credit market, issuance by both financial and non-financial corporates had continued to be robust, including a large proportion offshore. There had been little change in spreads. Despite further issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities in September, the market remained dependent on the support of the Australian Office of Financial Management, which had purchased the longer-dated tranches in the month and a third of total issuance in the September quarter. ", " Members noted staff estimates that banks' funding costs had been relatively flat over recent months. While the spread between lending rates and funding costs was below its peak in 2009, it remained well above its pre-crisis level. ", " There had been a marked repricing of the outlook for monetary policy over the past month. Around the time of the previous Board meeting there had been some expectation of an interest rate reduction, but the market now expected an interest rate increase by the end of the year. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Overall, the global outlook was broadly unchanged since the previous meeting. Global economic growth remained around trend, but with significant differences across regions. In the North Atlantic economies, growth remained subdued, and there were clearly downside risks, not least because there was little room for policy to respond if conditions deteriorated. In Asia, however, prospects remained for solid growth, despite some slowing from earlier in the year. Recent data for China had been a little stronger than in earlier months, suggesting that the risk of an unexpectedly large slowdown had diminished. Latin America was also generally doing well. Against this background, the prices of many of Australia's export commodities remained at high levels. Equity markets had also strengthened over the past month, even though financial markets were still characterised by a degree of uncertainty, most notably emanating from the strains on public finances and banking systems in some of the smaller European economies. ", " Domestically, members noted that the economy appeared to be evolving broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. The outlook remained for public spending to slow but for private demand to pick up noticeably, particularly in the case of business investment. For the moment, however, indicators of current growth in demand remained moderate, both for households and businesses, and credit growth had been subdued, especially for businesses. Year-ended inflation had moderated from earlier excessive levels, and in underlying terms was expected to remain within the target range over the near term; the recent further rise in the exchange rate would help promote this outcome. ", " As in the previous month, members concluded that interest rates would need to rise at some point if the economy evolved in line with the central scenario of a gradual tightening in resource utilisation, as this would most likely result in a gradual strengthening of inflation pressures. The timing of adjustment remained a matter of judgement. A case could be made to increase the cash rate at the current meeting, based on the medium-term inflation outlook and the fact that developments had continued to be broadly consistent with the central forecast scenario. The case to wait before making a tightening move was that the economy was still expected to continue growing at trend in the near term, credit growth had softened somewhat and the rise in the exchange rate would, if it continued, effectively be tightening financial conditions at the margin. Moreover, it was still possible that downside risks to global growth could materialise. ", " Members felt that these arguments were finely balanced. While the Board recognised that it could not wait indefinitely to see whether risks materialised, members judged that they had the flexibility to do so on this occasion. Overall, they concluded that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady for the time being, pending evaluation of further information at the next meeting. "], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.5 per cent."]}},

"], "International Economic Conditions": [" The meeting began with a discussion about the world economic environment. National accounts data for the September quarter for most of Australia's major trading partners indicated that, weighted by their shares in Australia's merchandise exports, year-ended growth had continued to be about 5 per cent. While there had been little sign of a slowdown in the data thus far, forecasts from the IMF in October indicated that trading partner growth on this basis was likely to slow in 2008 to around 4½ per cent. The latest adverse developments in credit markets suggested that these forecasts would be revised down further. ", " Members examined the revised September-quarter GDP figures for the United States. These data highlighted the resilience of the US economy to date, with growth now recorded at 2.8 per cent over the year. The moderate slowdown in aggregate growth over the past two years had been driven by developments in the housing sector. The latest data showed that non-housing parts of the US economy had remained strong, with exports in particular now rising strongly, assisted by the depreciation of the US dollar. Excluding residential investment, GDP growth had been almost 4 per cent over the past year. ", " Members noted that there was a range of views among forecasters about the seriousness of the slowdown in the US economy. In the US housing sector itself, the downturn had continued for longer than most observers had expected. It would be difficult in the period ahead for the rest of the US economy to remain as strong as it had been, since the housing downturn would feed back into employment and incomes and, therefore, spending. Consequently, the outlook for US GDP growth was weakening. But thus far the labour market had remained reasonably firm. Initial jobless claims, a high-frequency and timely indicator, had not at this stage shown any sign of the sharp rise that had been associated with recessions in the past. ", " In Japan, the quarterly GDP data had been volatile, but suggested that moderate growth had continued into the September quarter. A notable recent development had been the sharp fall in housing starts around mid year following a change to building codes. This had reduced growth in the September quarter. ", " Growth in the euro area had moderated over the past year. The appreciation of the euro had contributed to a moderation in export growth. ", " Growth in China had remained very rapid over the course of 2007, as measured by the latest data on industrial production. Chinese demand was boosting growth in other east Asian economies, which had recorded strengthening industrial production in recent months; it was now rising by over 8 per cent per annum in the region as a whole. However, given the outlook for the major industrial economies, it was uncertain whether the increased pace of growth in east Asia would be sustained during 2008. ", " Economic growth in India had been running at an average rate of around 9 per cent in the past three years, with the step-up in the pace of growth from earlier periods attributable to reforms undertaken mainly in the second half of the 1990s. Although less than half the size of China at present, the Indian economy was of rising importance to Australia, and was currently the destination for 6 per cent of Australia's exports. ", " The WTI crude oil price had reached almost US$100 per barrel during the past month, but had dropped back to below US$90 in the past week or so. The price of Tapis crude oil moved above US$100 per barrel during November, but had also fallen back. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Reviewing recent developments in the domestic economy, members noted that the national accounts for the September quarter were to be released the next day. The data published so far on the important expenditure and income components suggested that growth in GDP could be around 1 per cent in the quarter and close to 5 per cent on a year-ended basis, assuming no revisions. ", " Consumer spending had been a key driver of growth in the September quarter, with the volume of retail sales rising by around 2 per cent in the quarter. Consumer sentiment, which was a volatile indicator, had remained well above its long-run average level, though in the past two months it had declined. Motor vehicle sales had increased in the past few months to be 9 per cent higher than a year earlier. ", " Although indicators of private spending in the September quarter had been strong, there had been an easing in the demand for finance by households in recent months. Growth of housing credit had fallen from a monthly rate of about 1 per cent in the first half of the year to about 0.8 per cent more recently. Housing loan approvals, as a share of credit outstanding, had also eased in the past few months. Overall credit had continued to rise steadily in recent months, with the slowing in household credit growth more than offset by a rise in the growth of business credit, which had increased by 22 per cent over the past year. Part of the recent pick-up in business credit reflected greater reliance by businesses on bank funding in response to more difficult capital market conditions. But, even allowing for this effect, total business borrowing was still rising rapidly. ", " Members noted that business investment was estimated to have increased by more than 10 per cent over the year to the September quarter, in a continuation of the strong period of growth recorded over the past five years. As a share of GDP, investment had reached a high level, equal to that seen in the late 1980s. The buildings and structures component, in particular, had risen rapidly as a share of GDP. In the past three years, engineering construction spending had increased at an average annual rate of almost 30 per cent, while non-residential building had also increased rapidly. ", " While the high level of business investment was adding to productive capacity, business surveys indicated that capacity constraints remained significant. A recent survey of small and medium businesses showed that while a sizeable proportion of respondents had no major concerns, finding quality staff had clearly become a greater concern than the lack of work or sales over the past two years. This supported other indicators of very tight conditions in the labour market. ", " Members noted that export earnings had risen by more than 50 per cent over the past four years, largely because of the strong trend rise in commodity prices. Export volumes had increased by about 20 per cent over that period, and had begun to rise more strongly in the past year for the major categories apart from rural exports, which had been adversely affected by the drought. Growth of imports in volume terms had increased significantly over the past year, a sign of the strength of domestic demand and also reflecting a higher exchange rate. ", " Over the past few years, the terms of trade had recorded the largest increase since the early 1950s, and were continuing to provide a boost to Australian incomes. ", " Discussion turned to wages and the inflation outlook. According to the wage price index, there had been a slight upward drift in wage growth in the September quarter, measured on a year-ended basis, though interpreting the data had been made more difficult by recent changes to the timing of the minimum wage decision. Members discussed trends in wages in various sectors. The staff forecast for inflation had been revised to take account of the November monetary policy decision and incorporate a lower assumption for the trade-weighted exchange rate. On this basis, underlying inflation was forecast to rise above 3 per cent in the next two quarters and then to ease gradually, to around 3 per cent, over the ensuing quarters. "], "Financial Markets": [" The discussion then turned to financial markets. Board members observed that sentiment had deteriorated markedly again during the past month. This was particularly evident in a tightening in money market conditions in major financial markets, with yields rising relative to expected central bank policy rates, to around the levels seen in August and September. ", " Reasons for the recent rise in spreads included a desire for higher levels of liquidity as the year-end approached; further announcements of write-downs from credit losses from investment banks and semi-public financial agencies in the United States; some ratings downgrades; and concerns about the potential spillovers from problems being experienced by bond insurers (‘monolines’). ", " Central banks around the world had again responded to the tightening in credit conditions by injecting liquidity. As in the earlier period, the extent of pressure in the Australian money market was less than had been evident elsewhere. The Bank's approach was to continue to supply enough funds to keep the cash rate at the target. ", " Market expectations were that the US Fed would cut the federal funds rate by at least 25 basis points at its policy meeting on 11 December. Beyond that, three further reductions by the middle of 2008 had been priced in by the market. As a consequence of the changed market expectations in recent months, the US yield curve had shifted down considerably, particularly at shorter maturities. ", " Government bond yields had declined over the past month to as low as 3.8 per cent in the United States, though more recently they had risen a little from that trough. Yields on German and Japanese government debt had not fallen as far and, for the first time in over three years, 10-year German yields were trading above those on US bonds of equivalent maturity. The spread between 10-year Australian and US bond yields was now over 200 basis points. ", " While a monetary policy easing of 100 basis points was now priced in for the United States, there was no expectation of a rate change in either the euro area or Japan. Reductions in policy rates were expected in Canada and the United Kingdom, and a further rise was expected in Sweden. Monetary policy settings had been tightened further in China. ", " Corporate bond spreads in the United States had widened, particularly for lower-rated credits, but corporate yields on highly rated debt had still declined in the past few months, given the reduction in Treasury bond yields. ", " In Australia, corporate bond yields had risen, partly because of the rise in Australian government bond yields. However, business funding had increased steadily over the past year. ", " Members observed that the renewed bout of pessimism in world financial markets had also been reflected in share prices. Declines in major equity markets had been led by sharp falls in the share prices of financial stocks over the past month or two, though they had risen somewhat more recently. Share prices in emerging markets had also declined over the past month. ", " Although the share prices of Australian financial stocks had fallen over the past month, they had performed considerably better than their US counterparts, particularly commercial banks, and were higher over the past year. ", " Foreign exchange markets had been highly volatile over the month. The euro reached a new high against the US dollar and, unlike in recent months, the yen appreciated noticeably. ", " The Australian dollar had traded in a wide range over the past month, particularly against the yen, and continued to be a bellwether of sentiment in financial markets generally. Intraday volatility against the US dollar had been the highest for the year. Although the exchange rate fell significantly against most currencies in the trade-weighted basket over the past month, it was still higher against most of the currencies over the year, and about 5 per cent higher on a trade-weighted basis. ", " Turning to domestic financial markets, members looked at the continuing trend for Australian banks to switch their funding, particularly short-term funding, from offshore to onshore; the data were available to the end of September and it was likely that this process had continued since then. The tightening of financial conditions and a widening of spreads over the past month had led to higher funding costs. For example, the increase in bank bill yields since July had been about 35 basis points more than the increase attributable to the increase in the cash rate. To date, loan rates had risen on products that were linked directly to particular market rates. However, the standard indicator rates on prime, full-doc housing loans thus far had not been raised in response to higher costs. ", " Members discussed pricing in the credit market, which suggested only a low probability was attached to a policy change at this meeting. Markets saw a 40–50 per cent chance of a tightening at the February 2008 meeting, with a tightening fully priced in by later in 2008. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" The recommendation to the Board was to leave the cash rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent. ", " Members remained concerned about the outlook for inflation. Inflation in CPI and underlying terms was expected to be above 3 per cent in the first half of 2008, before declining somewhat thereafter, to be around 3 per cent at the end of the forecast period. Most data indicated continued strong expansion in demand in Australia, with continuing pressure on capacity. The information available on the domestic economy thus suggested that higher interest rates were likely to be required. ", " The world economy did not look as strong as in earlier months. Slower growth in the US and some other major economies appeared to be in prospect in the near term, and downside risks had increased because of the financial turmoil. Overall, global growth in the year ahead was thought likely to be closer to trend than suggested by forecasts available at the previous meeting. At the same time, high prices for food, energy and natural resources posed a significant risk to inflation around the world. ", " As a result of the strains in global credit and money markets, over the month market interest rates had risen independently of official rates in many countries. The increases in Australia were less pronounced than elsewhere, and sound borrowers had ample access to finance. But compared with the actual and expected cash rate, short-term borrowing costs had still risen noticeably since the November meeting. To date, lenders had largely confined the pass-through of these increased costs to business borrowers, though household borrowers could, in time, face some additional increase as well. These developments could be expected to exert an additional degree of restraint on demand, over and above that caused by the increases in the cash rate since mid year. ", " Members indicated that, absent the changes in market yields since the November meeting, there would have been a strong case on domestic grounds for a rise in the cash rate at this meeting. But given that a rise in money market rates had occurred, members observed that a further rise in the cash rate at this meeting, by adding to these market pressures, would result in quite a significant tightening of overall financial conditions over a short period. On the evidence currently available, and given the uncertainty over the global outlook, this did not appear to be immediately warranted. ", " This consideration pointed towards maintaining the existing cash rate for the time being, pending evaluation of financial market developments and new data at the next meeting. The question to be addressed at that time would be whether the interest rates faced by borrowers as a result of the combination of policy action and market developments would exert sufficient restraint to contain inflation over the medium term. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent. It was agreed that a statement explaining the decision should make clear the Board's continuing concern about the outlook for inflation. "], "Communication about Monetary Policy": [" Having reviewed communication issues over several months, the Board agreed that the changes discussed at the previous meeting should be announced the following day; the changes encompassed a monthly statement of explanation, the announcement of the decision on the afternoon of the day of the meeting and the release of minutes of the monetary policy discussion. It was agreed that the time when the result of the meeting would be expected by observers – i.e. 9.30 am – was the best time to make the announcement. Given the finely balanced nature of the decision, it was also agreed that it was appropriate to make a statement explaining the decision taken at this meeting, in accordance with the new arrangements, even though that would surprise observers.

Overall, the central forecast for the global economy was still for around trend growth over the next couple of years. ", " Members noted that recent information about the Chinese economy suggested that growth had slowed to a more sustainable pace after the earlier rapid recovery. GDP was estimated to have grown by around 2 per cent in the September quarter and by 9½ per cent over the year, and the indices of activity in the manufacturing sector for October suggested continuing solid growth. While Chinese exports and imports had declined slightly over recent months, both consumption and investment looked to have grown solidly. There were also further signs that the property market was strengthening again after having cooled earlier in response to policy measures. Inflation had increased recently, largely reflecting higher food prices. In response to these developments, the People's Bank of China had lifted benchmark interest rates for the first time in the current phase and additional measures had been taken to dampen activity in the property market. ", " Growth in other parts of Asia had also eased from its earlier strong pace, but remained solid. While exports had softened recently, domestic demand was growing at a robust pace in most economies, with the exception of Japan. Consumption was growing solidly, consumer confidence was generally high and recent data pointed to continued strength in investment. In several of the higher-income economies in the region, as also in China, CPI inflation was rising again, largely reflecting increasing inflation in food prices. ", " In the United States, growth had slowed considerably over the June and September quarters, with GDP increasing by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter. While business investment was gradually picking up, weak consumer spending and high levels of excess capacity were acting as a drag on prospects for both capital spending and construction activity. Job vacancies had been growing since late 2009, although private-sector job creation remained very weak. Budget problems in state and local government were resulting in job losses in these sectors. ", " In Europe, confidence and activity indicators pointed to continued strength in Germany, and September quarter GDP in the United Kingdom had again surprised on the upside. Elsewhere in Europe, consumption growth and labour markets remained weak and the planned fiscal consolidation was weighing on the outlook. ", " Members discussed developments in inflation in the major advanced economies. Inflation had been trending down recently in most of these economies, reflecting the low level of resource utilisation, with year-ended core inflation around or below 1 per cent in the United States and the euro area, and prices were falling by around 1½ per cent over the past year in Japan. An exception was the United Kingdom, where core inflation had remained relatively high. ", " Most commodity prices had strengthened over the past couple of months. The spot price for iron ore was around 10 per cent above the estimated December quarter contract price. The combination of strong demand, low stocks and a range of supply disruptions had led to increases in the prices of a number of agricultural commodities. Members discussed the factors behind the increases in food prices, including the significant change in diet that was occurring as incomes rose in emerging economies. The terms of trade for Australia were estimated to have reached around a 60-year high in the September quarter. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Conditions in the domestic economy had continued to evolve broadly as expected. The main news over the past month related to CPI and employment data, and investment in the resources sector. ", " The labour market remained strong. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1 per cent in September, with employment increasing by a further 50,000 in the month, and by around 3¼ per cent over the year. Members noted that other evidence suggested that the labour market might not be as tight as indicated by the unemployment rate. ", " Consumer sentiment remained at a high level, with consumer surveys reporting that it was a good time to buy major household items. While liaison and recent data on retail trade provided a picture of varied conditions across the different segments of the retail market, they mostly suggested that consumers were still cautious in their spending and that discounting was extensive. ", " In the housing market, conditions had softened relative to earlier in the year, with national housing prices broadly flat over recent months. Auction clearance rates remained around long-run average levels. Loan approvals had drifted down over the course of the year and growth in housing credit had been moderate over recent months. Other forms of household credit had been flat recently and liaison with retailers had noted a pick-up in cash payments relative to credit cards. ", " Business conditions remained generally favourable, although there were clear differences across sectors and regions. Indicators of investment intentions were mostly positive, particularly for the resources sector, where the pipeline of work to be done was large. Members discussed developments in the LNG sector, including the recent investment decision on the project in Queensland to convert coal-seam methane to LNG. There were also positive indications for some other LNG projects that were still in the planning stage. Developments in the LNG sector, including the likely significant imported component, appeared to be broadly in line with earlier assumptions. ", " The impact of the exchange rate appreciation was evident in a number of sectors. Visitor arrivals had increased only modestly over the past five years, while overseas departures by Australians had increased strongly, with a consequent decline in domestic tourism. The high exchange rate had also had a negative effect on the education sector, although changes in government policies were likely to have been a more important factor. Despite the strengthening of the exchange rate, surveys suggested that conditions in the manufacturing sector were around average. In part, this reflected the fact that many manufacturers benefited from cheaper imported capital equipment and components when the exchange rate appreciated, and that some focused mostly on the domestic market. ", " Conditions were mixed in other sectors, and there were few signs of recovery in non-residential construction, where access to funding remained tight. Members discussed recent developments in business finance. While credit outstanding had declined in recent months, it appeared that many large businesses had good access to funding from profits and the capital markets, and business surveys suggested that the availability of finance had improved relative to late 2008 and early 2009. It was noteworthy that business deposits had been rising over the past year while lending was falling. ", " The staff's revised central forecast for GDP growth was broadly similar to that at the time of the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. GDP was expected to expand by 3½ per cent over 2010, with growth picking up to be in the 3¾–4 per cent range over 2011 and 2012. This positive outlook for the domestic economy was underpinned by the income surge flowing from the very high level of the terms of trade and the expected growth in investment in the resources sector. While the terms of trade were expected to decline over the next couple of years, export prices were forecast to remain at a higher level than at the time of the August <em>Statement</em>. ", " The CPI had increased by 0.7 per cent in the September quarter, to be 2.8 per cent higher over the year. This was a slightly smaller rise than had been expected three months earlier, partly reflecting a surprising fall in food prices and lower fuel prices. Utilities prices increased significantly in the quarter and rose by 12 per cent over the year, reflecting broad-based increases in electricity, gas and water &amp; sewerage charges. Members discussed the significant increases in electricity prices in recent years, which in part reflected ongoing strong demand, especially at peak times, and an earlier period of under-investment in the distribution network. ", " In underlying terms, inflation was around ½ per cent in the quarter and 2½ per cent over the year. Members viewed the return of year-ended underlying inflation to the middle of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> target as a positive development. However, the staff assessment was that underlying inflation was unlikely to moderate much further, given the pick-up in economic growth over the past year and the strengthening of the labour market. ", " The medium-term outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged, although the near-term forecast for year-ended inflation had been lowered slightly. In underlying terms, inflation was expected to remain around 2½ per cent until mid 2011, before gradually rising to 3 per cent by the end of 2012. Year-ended headline CPI inflation was expected to remain above underlying inflation in the near term. "], "Financial Markets": [" The main driver of financial market developments over the past month had been the expectation that the Federal Reserve would engage in further quantitative easing. An announcement was expected following the FOMC policy meeting later in the week. The exact nature of the Fed's action was still uncertain but it was expected to involve significant further purchases of US Treasuries. ", " Government debt yields had remained low in most of the major economies, indicating that policy interest rates in those economies were expected to remain at their current levels for the foreseeable future. The Bank of Japan had announced additional easing, including a slight lowering in its target for the policy rate, a commitment to maintain this policy until price stability was in sight, and further asset purchases. ", " The balance sheet of the European Central Bank (ECB) had been contracting for several months as earlier liquidity operations matured. This was resulting in an upward drift in short-term market rates towards the ECB's policy rate. Data to the end of September showed a rise in borrowing from the ECB by Irish banks, but modest falls in borrowing by some of the other smaller countries. Spreads on Irish government bonds had widened recently. ", " A number of central banks had tightened policy. In China, the central bank had lifted deposit and lending rates for the first time since 2007. There had also been tightening of monetary policy in Chile, Singapore, Sweden and Taiwan. ", " The expectation of further easing by the Federal Reserve had provided a boost to global equity markets, which had risen back to their levels prior to the Greek turmoil earlier in the year. Emerging market equities had performed relatively better over this period. ", " One sector that had underperformed the global market was the US banking sector, whose share prices had been weighed down by recent earnings reports that showed a slowing in income growth, and by the concerns about the foreclosure process that had recently surfaced. Members noted that around 5 per cent of all US mortgages were in the process of foreclosure at the end of June. ", " Expectations of US monetary easing had affected currency markets, causing the US dollar to weaken. In trade-weighted terms, the US dollar was now only slightly above its record low in 2008. The Japanese yen was close to its record high (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. The Chinese renminbi had been broadly unchanged against the US dollar over the previous month, but had depreciated modestly in trade-weighted terms. The Australian dollar had reached parity against the US dollar briefly during the month, before falling back. This marked a post-float high against the US dollar, with the Australian dollar also close to its post-float high in trade-weighted terms. ", " The depreciation of the US dollar had prompted concerns among policy-makers in a number of countries about appreciation of their currencies and capital inflows, as well as the prospect of destabilising capital outflows in the future. The authorities in Brazil and Thailand had increased taxes on capital inflows, while the introduction of capital controls was being considered in Korea, Indonesia and South Africa. A number of countries had continued to intervene to limit the appreciation of their currencies, and data released over the past month had shown a significant build-up in reserves by a number of countries during the September quarter. ", " Domestically, the most recent data showed a continuation of the trends in bank funding that had been apparent for some time. The shares of relatively high cost funds, such as domestic deposits and long-term debt, had continued to rise, while the share of short-term debt had continued to fall. Members were briefed on developments in funding costs. Most banks had reported a small reduction in net interest margins in their most recent half-yearly accounts, though some had experienced an increase. Deposit competition appeared to have levelled off in recent months. In debt markets, spreads on short-term bank bills had narrowed to be not far above pre-crisis levels. Spreads on longer-term bank debt had stabilised at levels that were significantly higher than before the crisis. This was slowly adding to the banks' cost of funds as banks rolled over debt issued earlier at lower spreads. Members noted that there was a possibility that banks would increase interest rates on loans by more than any move in the cash rate. ", " Issuance of bank bonds and mortgage-backed securities had been fairly low over the previous month, partly reflecting the timing of bank profit announcements. The low level of global interest rates had allowed some companies to borrow in capital markets relatively cheaply at much longer maturities than had traditionally been available. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that significant differences remained in the economic performance of various parts of the global economy. The expansion of the US economy remained weak and it was likely that the Federal Reserve would announce additional quantitative easing within a few days. Also, there were still fragilities in Europe relating to banking sectors and fiscal positions. In contrast, the past month had provided further confirmation that the Chinese economy was continuing to grow solidly and was not experiencing a greater-than-expected slowdown. The outlook for many other emerging economies also remained positive and there had been some increase in commodity prices. In relation to financial markets, members noted that the turmoil seen earlier in the year had continued to abate, though sentiment remained fragile. ", " Domestically, inflation had come in slightly lower than expected in the September quarter, partly reflecting movements in the prices of some volatile items, including food. In underlying terms, year-ended inflation was now at the centre of the target. The news on the real economy had been mostly positive, with an upgrade to forecasts for the terms of trade, further indications of a likely surge in resources investment, and continuing strength in the labour market. Developments in credit and asset markets, on the other hand, had remained subdued. ", " Overall, members considered that developments in terms of activity and inflation were broadly consistent with the central scenario the Bank had envisaged for some months. The outlook for growth in the resources sector was very strong and GDP growth was expected to rise gradually. While inflation had moderated, it was likely that the decline was now largely complete; inflation was expected to remain around the current level for several quarters, but was likely to move higher thereafter. ", " In previous meetings, members had discussed the likelihood that interest rates would need to rise, at some point, if the economy continued to evolve in line with the central scenario. Based on developments over the past month and the latest assessment of the outlook, members judged that the point at which some upward move in interest rates would be necessary had moved closer. ", " As in October, a case could be made for waiting a little longer: the expected pick-up in domestic growth would be only in its early stages; the latest CPI outcome had been relatively good; and credit growth and housing prices were subdued. In addition, the exchange rate had appreciated over the past month, and quite significantly over a longer period, which would dampen inflation pressures somewhat. There might also be a case for waiting to see if the Federal Reserve's upcoming announcement had a significant further effect on the exchange rate. ", " On the other hand, some of the uncertainties that had been a reason to keep interest rates steady over the past few months had lessened recently, even though they had not dissipated completely. Compared with several months ago, downside risks to the global economy had still not materialised in any significant way. Indeed, the uncertainty regarding the outlook for the Chinese economy had lessened, commodity markets had strengthened and the outlook for investment had firmed. With only a relatively modest amount of spare capacity in the economy, a gradual upward trend in inflation remained likely over the medium term. If monetary policy was to be conducted in a forward-looking way, these developments meant there was a case for increasing interest rates at the current meeting. ", " Members considered that the arguments were finely balanced. However, with the flow of information over the past month generally suggesting that the medium-term economic outlook remained one of strengthening economic activity and gradually rising inflation, the Board judged that the balance of risks had shifted to the point where a modest tightening of monetary policy was prudent. Members noted that lending rates might increase by more than the cash rate, but this tendency would not be lessened by delaying a change in the cash rate. Lending rates had been rising relative to the cash rate since the global financial crisis, and the Board had taken this into account in setting the cash rate. It would continue to take account of any changes in margins in its decisions in the period ahead. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to raise the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 per cent, effective 3 November. "]}},

", " Members were briefed about the announcement by the European Central Bank (ECB) of a large sovereign bond purchase program in January, following its assessment that its existing measures would not be sufficient to prevent inflation from remaining well below 2 per cent for a prolonged period. Starting in March, the ECB plans to purchase €60 billion of securities each month, well above the current rate of purchases of private securities; sovereign bonds would be bought in proportion to member countries' contributions to the ECB's capital. Debt purchases would continue until there was a sustained increase in inflation, but they would end no earlier than September 2016. This would increase the size of the ECB's balance sheet past its 2012 peak of €3.1 trillion. While less than the US Federal Reserve's maximum purchases of US$85 billion a month, on an annualised basis the ECB's purchases would be equivalent to around 7½ per cent of the euro area's annual GDP, compared with 6 per cent of US GDP for purchases by the Federal Reserve (and 16 per cent of Japanese GDP for purchases by the Bank of Japan). ", " Members noted that the Federal Reserve continued to indicate that it expected to start increasing its policy rate around the middle of this year, but financial markets had pushed back expectations for the first rate rise in the United States to around the end of the year. A number of central banks had eased policy in recent months in response to the effect of lower oil prices, including the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of Canada. Markets had also pushed back expectations for policy tightening by a number of other central banks. In contrast, the central banks of Russia and Brazil had increased their policy rates. ", " The Swiss National Bank (SNB) abandoned its exchange rate ceiling against the euro, which had been in place since September 2011, and lowered the rate on bank deposits at the SNB by 50 basis points to −0.75 per cent. The SNB's announcement noted that divergences between the monetary policies of the major currency areas had increased significantly. The move surprised markets, resulting in considerable market volatility and the bankruptcy of several foreign exchange brokers. ", " Members noted that sovereign bond yields in the major markets had fallen significantly since the December meeting. The falls had occurred across the yield curve but were particularly pronounced at longer maturities, with yields on 10-year bonds in the United States falling back to around 1.6 per cent and those in Germany and Japan reaching historic lows of 30 and 20 basis points, respectively. At these levels there was very little, if any, compensation for term risk. For maturities up to five years, yields on bonds issued by Japan, Germany and most of the core euro area economies, as well as Sweden and Switzerland, had fallen below zero. Yields on Australian government bonds had mostly tracked global developments and had also fallen considerably, with the 10-year yield declining to a historical low below 2½ per cent. ", " The declines in global bond yields reflected a number of factors but the extent of the decline in yields was difficult to explain. The large bond purchases by major central banks had clearly contributed but so too had a reduction in bond supply, reflecting a narrowing of fiscal deficits in a number of countries. Concerns about the global growth outlook and the risk of sustained low inflation following falls in the oil price had also played a role. ", " Members noted that the Greek authorities had indicated that they planned to restructure the country's debt, most of which was owed to official sector institutions. Greece had nonetheless also indicated a desire to remain part of the euro area. The current European assistance program expired at the end of February and markets had been closed to Greece since the recent election. Members also noted that the critical issue in the near term was not so much the obligations of the Greek Government but rather the funding of Greek banks. To date, there had been minimal spillover from developments in Greece to other markets. ", " There had been sizeable movements in exchange rates since the December meeting, reflecting the increasingly divergent paths of monetary policy among the major advanced economies. Most notably, the Swiss franc had appreciated by around 15 per cent against the euro since mid January. While the US dollar had depreciated against the Swiss franc, it had also appreciated further against most other currencies since the December meeting (including by around 10 per cent against the euro). The renminbi had been little changed against the US dollar over much of 2014, but had depreciated somewhat since the December meeting. ", " The Australian dollar had depreciated by around 9 per cent against the US dollar since the December meeting. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar was around 4 per cent below its early 2014 levels, notwithstanding significant falls in commodity prices over the intervening period. The depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar and renminbi had been partly offset by its appreciation against the yen and euro. ", " Equity prices in advanced economies had been broadly unchanged since early December, notwithstanding a strong rally in European share prices following the announcement of the expansion of the ECB asset purchase program. Global equity prices had risen moderately over 2014, led by an 11 per cent increase in US equity prices, while Chinese equities had significantly outperformed other emerging markets since mid 2014. ", " In Australia, equity prices recorded a smaller rise over 2014 than that recorded in most global markets, primarily reflecting the decline in equity prices of resource companies. Equity prices had increased by 4 per cent since the start of 2015 even though prices of resource companies had fallen further. ", " Members noted that Australian lending rates on the outstanding stock of housing and business loans had continued to edge down since the December meeting. At the time of the December meeting, financial market pricing had suggested some chance of an easing in policy during 2015. This expectation strengthened somewhat during January, and by the time of the February meeting pricing reflected a two-thirds probability of a 25 basis point reduction in the cash rate at that meeting, with the cash rate expected to be 2 per cent by the end of the year. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that growth of Australia's major trading partners had been around its long-run average in 2014 and that early indications suggested this pace had continued into 2015. Prices of a range of commodities, notably oil and iron ore, had fallen further in recent months, reflecting a combination of both lower growth in global demand for commodities and, more importantly, significant increases in supply. Members also noted that the lower oil prices, if sustained, would be positive for the growth of Australia's trading partners, which are net importers of energy, and would continue to put downward pressure on global prices of goods and services. Very accommodative global financial conditions were also expected to support global growth in 2015. These positive effects on trading partner growth, however, were expected to be largely offset in 2015 by a gradual decline in the pace of growth in China. ", " In China, economic growth had eased a little but was close to the authorities' target for 2014. Growth of household consumption had held up over 2014, while growth of investment and industrial production – which contribute significantly to the demand for commodities – had trended lower over the past year or so. Conditions in the residential property market had remained weak, and measures introduced to support the market appear to have had only a modest effect so far. ", " In Japan, economic activity had been weaker than expected since the increase in the consumption tax in April 2014, but growth appeared to have resumed in the December quarter and the labour market remained tight. However, inflation had declined in recent months and remained well below the Bank of Japan's target. The pace of growth had slowed a little in the rest of east Asia over 2014; as the region as a whole is a net importer of oil, activity was likely to have been supported by the decline in oil prices. ", " Members observed that the US economy had continued to strengthen, resulting in output growing at an above-trend pace over the second half of 2014. Employment growth had picked up further and the unemployment rate had continued to decline. Ongoing strength in the labour market and lower gasoline prices had contributed to a sharp rise in consumer sentiment. On the other hand, growth in the euro area remained modest. Inflation had remained well below the ECB's target and inflation expectations had declined further, prompting the ECB to implement additional stimulus measures. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the data released since the December meeting suggested that the domestic economy had continued to grow at a below-trend pace over the second half of 2014. Resource exports appeared to have continued growing in the December quarter and growth was expected to remain strong, particularly as liquefied natural gas (LNG) production came on line over the next year or so. The lower exchange rate was expected to support growth of exports, particularly service exports such as education and tourism. ", " Activity and prices in the housing market had continued to be bolstered by the low level of lending rates and strong population growth. A range of indicators, including residential building approvals, suggested further growth of dwelling investment in the near term. Housing price inflation had moderated from the rapid rates seen in late 2013, but remained high and in Sydney and Melbourne had been well above the growth rate of household income. Growth of owner-occupier housing credit had remained around 6 per cent in year-ended terms, while investor credit had continued to grow at a noticeably faster rate. ", " Members were briefed on the main regulatory actions taken recently to address housing risks in the domestic economy. In particular, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) had announced several policy measures in early December to reinforce sound residential mortgage lending practices. These policies included clarification of prudential expectations on what constituted acceptable growth in housing lending to investors and the possible steps that would be considered if APRA's expectations were not met, such as increased capital requirements. ", " Turning to the business sector, members noted that mining investment had continued to decline in the second half of 2014, and larger declines were expected over 2015 as existing projects were completed and very few new projects were likely to proceed. Non-mining business investment had remained subdued and recent data pointed to this continuing into the first half of 2015. Growth in public demand was expected to be subdued over the next year or so. ", " Members observed that household consumption growth had picked up since its lows in early 2013, supported by low interest rates and rising housing wealth. However, consumption growth had remained below average. The recent decline in fuel prices was expected to provide some offset for overall household incomes from weak growth in labour incomes. ", " Members noted that the most recent data on the labour market had been a little more positive than early in 2014. However, while employment growth had strengthened somewhat over the past year, the unemployment rate had increased further over 2014 and average hours worked had remained below the levels of a few years ago. Leading indicators of labour demand had changed little in recent months and pointed to only modest employment growth in the months ahead. ", " Consumer price inflation had declined in year-ended terms, partly as a result of a large fall in fuel prices in the December quarter and the effect of the repeal of the carbon price on utility prices in the September quarter. Various measures of underlying inflation, which largely abstract from these and other temporary factors, had declined in year-ended terms to around 2¼ per cent. Non-tradables inflation (excluding utility prices) had declined further in year-ended terms to relatively low levels, consistent with subdued domestic cost pressures. Prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) were little changed in the December quarter, but were expected to face upward pressure over time from the pass-through of the depreciation of the Australian dollar since early 2013. ", " Turning their discussion to the economic outlook, members noted that staff forecasts for output, which were conditioned on an assumption of no change in the cash rate, had been revised lower in the near term. Recent data indicated that the expected pick-up in consumption and non-mining business investment was likely to occur later than had been previously anticipated, while the pick-up in LNG exports over coming quarters was now likely to be less rapid. At the same time, it was anticipated that the net effect of commodity price changes and the exchange rate depreciation over the past three months would provide a positive impetus to domestic growth over the next year or so. Overall, the underlying forces driving growth remained much as they had been for some time and GDP growth was still expected to pick up gradually to an above-trend pace in the latter part of the forecast period. ", " The revisions to GDP growth implied that the unemployment rate would peak at a higher rate and later than had been previously forecast, before declining gradually. The inflation forecast had also been revised lower, reflecting the softer outlook for labour and product markets as well as the recent fall in oil prices. Headline inflation was expected to remain low for a time, before picking up at the end of the forecast period. Underlying inflation was expected to remain well contained and consistent with the target throughout the forecast period. ", " Members discussed a number of uncertainties around the forecasts. They noted that developments in commodity markets, particularly the price of oil, would affect future global growth and inflation outcomes. One area of uncertainty continued to be the outlook for the Chinese property market and its implications for Chinese demand for commodities. Members also noted that developments in commodity markets were likely to be affected by supply factors; for instance, the response of ‘unconventional’ oil producers in North America to lower oil prices. ", " As usual, the path of the exchange rate remained a key area of uncertainty. Members noted that the exchange rate had remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, given the decline in commodity prices over the past year, and that future exchange rate movements would be affected by market expectations for monetary policy, both domestically and abroad. They noted that, all else being equal, a sustained further depreciation would, if it occurred, stimulate growth in the domestic economy and put some temporary upward pressure on inflation. ", " Members noted that there was considerable uncertainty around the timing and extent of the expected increase in household consumption growth and non-mining business investment. Although fundamental factors such as low interest rates and strong population growth remained in place, they had not been sufficient to see a significant pick-up in the growth of these variables or a decline in the degree of spare capacity in the labour market. In addition, recent data suggested that the expected improvement in economic conditions would occur later than had been previously expected. Members commented that a strengthening in non-mining investment was a necessary element for growth to pick up to an above-trend pace, and noted the importance of confidence in underpinning such an outcome. Indeed, an improvement in the appetite for businesses to take on risk had the potential, should it occur, to lead to much stronger growth in non-mining business investment than currently forecast. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In assessing the appropriate stance for monetary policy in Australia, members noted that the outlook for global economic growth was little changed, with Australia's major trading partners still forecast to grow by around the pace of recent years in 2015. Commodity prices, particularly those for iron ore and oil, had declined over the past year largely in response to expansions in global supply, though members judged that demand-side factors, such as the weakness in Chinese property markets, had also played some role. Conditions in global financial markets had remained very accommodative. ", " Domestically, over recent months there had been fewer indications of a near-term strengthening in growth than previous forecasts would have implied. This included survey measures of household and business confidence, which remained around or even a bit below average. As a result, the revised staff forecasts – which were based on an unchanged cash rate – suggested that GDP growth would remain below trend over the course of this year, before gradually picking up to an above-trend pace in 2016, somewhat later than had been previously expected. The unemployment rate was therefore expected to peak a little higher (and later) than in the previous forecast. The net effect of declining commodity prices and the depreciation of the exchange rate was expected to boost growth over the forecast period. Nonetheless, the higher degree of spare capacity now in prospect and lower oil prices had led to a lowering of the forecast for inflation, offset somewhat by the effects of the recent exchange rate depreciation. The restrained pace of wage increases over the past year or so and accompanying growth in productivity, which had dampened growth in unit labour costs, suggested that low rates of inflation were likely to be sustained. In other respects, the forces underpinning the outlook for domestic activity and inflation were much as they had been for some time. ", " Members noted the current accommodative setting of monetary policy, which had been providing support to domestic demand. They noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated noticeably against a rising US dollar over recent months, although less so against a basket of currencies, and that it remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. Members agreed that a lower exchange rate was likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy. ", " Given the large increases in housing prices in some cities and ongoing strength in lending to investors in housing assets, members also agreed that developments in the housing market would bear careful monitoring. They noted that it would be important to assess the effects of the measures designed to reinforce sound residential mortgage lending practices announced by APRA in December. ", " On the basis of their assessment of current conditions and taking into account the revised forecasts, the Board judged that a further reduction in the cash rate would be appropriate to provide additional support to demand, while inflation outcomes were expected to remain consistent with the 2 to 3 per cent target. In deciding the timing of such a change, members assessed arguments for acting at this meeting or at the following meeting. On balance, they judged that moving at this meeting, which offered the opportunity of early additional communication in the forthcoming <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, was the preferred course.

Members noted that low oil prices should boost global growth, with the effect largest in economies that imported most of their oil, such as the euro area and Japan. Lower oil prices had also led to lower headline inflation and members observed that core inflation, which abstracts from the direct effects of changes in energy prices, was also low in many economies. ", " New data from China were limited as a result of the Chinese New Year holidays. Manufacturing PMIs had remained around their average levels of the past couple of years, while residential property prices had fallen further over recent months, albeit at a slower pace. Lower growth in the demand for steel for residential construction had contributed to falling Chinese steel prices. Consistent with weaker growth in steel production and competition from lower-cost international producers of iron ore, domestic production of iron ore had moderated over the past six months. Total imports of iron ore, including from Australia, had held up over this period. Inflationary pressures remained subdued. ", " In the December quarter, growth had resumed in Japan and growth in east Asia had continued around its decade-average pace. More recent data suggested that growth in these economies continued in early 2015 at around the pace recorded in the December quarter, supported by lower oil prices. Members noted that business investment had made a significant contribution to growth in east Asia over the past couple of years and that Japanese exports had picked up following the depreciation of the yen. Recent growth in India had been revised significantly higher, while inflation had declined noticeably. ", " The US economy grew at an above-trend pace in the December quarter and recent data suggested that this pace had continued into 2015. Members noted that private demand, particularly business investment, had grown strongly over the past year. Consumption had also increased strongly, supported by further improvement in labour market conditions, lower gasoline prices and accommodative monetary policy. ", " Economic activity in the euro area had continued to recover slowly, with inflation remaining well below the target set by the European Central Bank (ECB). "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that a range of indicators suggested that Australian GDP growth continued at a below-trend pace in the December quarter and over the course of 2014. These indicators had suggested that growth of consumption, dwelling investment and public demand were likely to have increased, but that business investment was likely to have fallen further, largely reflecting further steep declines in mining investment. ", " Growth of retail sales volumes had picked up to an above-average pace in the December quarter and liaison suggested that the value of retail sales had increased in January. Real household incomes had been buoyed by the recent decline in oil prices and measures of consumer sentiment were around average levels. However, income growth had remained low by historical standards, which was likely to dampen future consumption growth. There had been further broad-based evidence of spare capacity in the labour market. The unemployment rate had continued its gradual upward trend of the past few years and average hours worked had remained subdued. Nevertheless, members noted that employment growth had picked up over the past year. Members also observed that wage growth outcomes had been low in the December quarter, consistent with ongoing spare capacity in the labour market and pressures on employers to contain costs. Data from surveys and information from liaison suggested that wage growth in the private sector was likely to remain around its recent pace over coming quarters and also pointed to modest employment growth over the same period. ", " Members discussed the extent to which accommodative monetary policy and ongoing strength in housing market activity would support consumption growth in the near term. They noted that the interest payments made by borrowers are significantly larger than the income received by holders of interest-bearing assets and, as a result, the very low level of interest rates was acting, other things equal, to support aggregate disposable income available for consumption. Members noted that the net effect on consumption through this transmission channel was a function of a number of factors, including the distribution of loans and interest-bearing assets across households and the extent to which the consumption behaviour of different households responds to low interest rates. ", " The current strength of housing construction and the increase in housing prices were expected to provide a measure of support for consumption. Housing price growth remained strongest in Sydney and to a lesser extent Melbourne, while price rises in other parts of the country had been more modest and prices had even declined in some cities recently. A range of indicators, including residential building approvals, suggested further strong growth of dwelling investment in the near term. Growth in housing credit for owner-occupiers had remained around 6 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms, while growth in credit for housing investors was noticeably faster, at over 10 per cent measured on the same basis. ", " Members noted that recent data on capital expenditure and non-residential work done had been consistent with earlier expectations that business investment would decline in the December quarter, largely owing to lower mining investment. The ABS survey of capital expenditure intentions implied further large falls in mining investment, as current projects were completed and few new projects were likely to proceed. The survey implied that non-mining investment would remain subdued for some time yet and for longer than had been previously expected. Members discussed the extent to which early estimates of future capital expenditure provide a reliable guide to final estimates, as well as the relationship between the capital expenditure survey and the measure of business investment in the national accounts. Overall, survey measures of business conditions had remained around their average levels, while the trend in non-residential building approvals was at a low level and conditions in the commercial property market remained weak, with office vacancy rates in all capital cities at high levels. ", " Available data suggested that export volumes rose slightly in the December quarter, as increases in non-bulk commodity exports offset declines in coal, service and rural exports. Exports of iron ore volumes were estimated to be little changed. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members observed that global financial markets continued to focus on developments in Greece over the past month, particularly the negotiations between the new Greek Government and its creditors ahead of the expiry of Greece's financial assistance program at the end of February. Although Greece had reached an agreement to negotiate a four-month extension of its program, any extension was contingent on the proposed structural reforms being viewed as sufficiently comprehensive by each of the European Commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund. Sizeable deposit outflows from Greek banks in recent months and a lack of access to private wholesale funding had significantly increased their dependence on ECB funding. Members noted that these developments had led to little contagion to other European countries to date, in contrast to the situation in the 2010 to 2012 period. ", " Market expectations for increases in the US federal funds rate had been brought forward over February, following better-than-expected employment data. It remained the case, however, that the market's implied future tightening of monetary policy was considerably more drawn out than the expectations of members of the Federal Open Market Committee, as published in December 2014. In Europe, the ECB was scheduled to commence buying government bonds in March and several central banks on the border of the euro zone – including Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland – had implemented negative interest rates to address continuing upward pressure on their exchange rates against the euro. ", " Government bond yields in the United States had tended to increase over February, unwinding part of the large declines over January. German 10-year bond yields were largely unchanged and had traded below those in Japan for the first time in around three decades. Domestically, movements in longer-term government bond yields broadly tracked those in the United States, but the spread to US yields continued to narrow to be the lowest since 2006. ", " Members noted that equity prices in advanced economies had increased by 5 per cent over February, while those in emerging markets had increased by a little less. Notably, Australian equity prices had risen by more than 5 per cent over the past month, and by 10 per cent over the year to date, with corporate earnings announcements having generally been in line with, or a little better than, analysts' expectations. ", " There had been little change in exchange rates over February, including for the Australian dollar. An increase in net private capital outflows from China had resulted in net sales of Chinese foreign exchange reserves in recent months, with the renminbi at the bottom of its trading band against the US dollar. ", " Australian lenders had passed on the reduction in the cash rate in February to housing and business borrowing rates. Most banks had also adjusted their deposit rates lower by 25 basis points, which had followed reductions in term deposit and bonus saver deposit rates of around 15 basis points in January. ", " Members concluded their discussion with the observation that financial markets were expecting another reduction in the cash rate target by May, with around a 50 per cent probability of the reduction occurring at the present meeting. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " Volatility in global financial markets had increased from the unusually low levels of a few months earlier. Financial systems had so far been resilient to some large price movements. However, regulators globally remained concerned that ‘search for yield’ behaviour could ultimately lead to disruptive repricing in financial markets. Members observed the heightened uncertainty regarding developments in Russia and Greece, and that most banks in the major advanced markets, including Australia, had relatively little direct exposure to these economies. ", " Members noted that conditions in the major global banking systems had continued to improve gradually. Profitability had increased overall and asset non-performance rates had declined even in the euro area, which had been the last of the major global banking sectors to begin to recover. However, credit growth and lending conditions remained relatively subdued, particularly in Europe, where low nominal income growth was exacerbating risks in the financial sector. In contrast to some major advanced economy banking systems, growth of credit in some Asian economies had remained rapid. Although this could be a sign of developing risk, non-performing loan rates at this stage remained low. ", " In Australia, risks in the household sector continued to be centred on housing and mortgage markets. The composition of these markets remained skewed to investor activity, especially in Sydney. Members noted that, at the margin, the recent decline in interest rates could boost the housing market, including prices. The measures announced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and Australian Securities and Investments Commission in December were designed to temper the housing market risks faced both by households and lenders, although these risks also needed to be placed in the context of the prevailing low levels of household stress. ", " Members further noted that risks had been beginning to build in commercial property markets, including developers of residential as well as non-residential property. Prices in several market segments had been rising, even as vacancy rates remained high and leasing conditions weakened. Outside of commercial property, risks to financial stability from the non-financial business sector generally appeared low and failure rates had been declining. ", " Members observed that the domestic financial sector had continued to perform strongly. Banks' domestic asset performance had continued to improve over the second half of 2014, especially for commercial property and other business lending. Non-performance rates on Australian banks' overseas assets had also declined, although the authorities in New Zealand had expressed concerns about rapid growth in housing prices and the indebtedness of the agricultural sector. Nevertheless, profitability of the Australian banking sector remained robust and the major banks continued to accumulate capital organically, leaving them well placed to meet any further increases in capital targets in the period ahead. ", " Members were briefed on recent developments in international regulation, including macroprudential measures announced in a range of countries over recent years. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In assessing the appropriate stance for monetary policy in Australia, members noted that the outlook for global economic growth had not changed, with Australia's major trading partners forecast to grow by around the average of recent years in 2015. Lower oil prices were expected to boost growth in major trading partners and reduce inflation temporarily. More generally, although the decline in many commodity prices over the past year had largely been in response to expansions in global supply, members observed that demand-side factors, including the weakness in Chinese property markets, had also played a role. Although the Australian dollar had depreciated, particularly against the US dollar, it remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. Conditions in global financial markets remained very accommodative. Changes to the stance of monetary policy by the major central banks were likely to be important influences on financial markets over the coming year. ", " Data available at the time of the meeting suggested that the Australian economy had continued to grow at a below-trend pace in the December quarter and that domestic demand growth had remained weak overall. There had been some evidence suggesting that growth of dwelling investment and consumption had picked up in the December quarter, but there had also been indications that business investment could remain subdued for longer than had been previously expected. On balance, the evidence suggested that labour market conditions were likely to remain subdued and the economy would continue to operate with a degree of spare capacity for some time. As a result, wage pressures were expected to remain contained and inflation was forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next year or so, even with a lower exchange rate. ", " At the same time, activity in the housing market had remained strong. Housing prices had continued to increase strongly in Sydney and at a solid pace in Melbourne. In other capital cities, trends had been more mixed and annual increases in capital city housing prices (excluding Sydney and Melbourne) had averaged about 3 per cent. Growth of dwelling investment was estimated to have picked up in the December quarter and was expected to remain at a high level in the near term. While credit had continued to grow a little faster than incomes, household leverage had not increased significantly and the Bank would continue to work with other regulators to assess and contain risks that might arise from the housing market. ", " Members noted that the current setting of monetary policy had been accommodative for some time and that the recent reduction in the cash rate would provide some further support to the economy. They also acknowledged that a lower exchange rate would help achieve balanced growth in the economy. Nonetheless, on the basis of the current forecasts for growth and inflation, members were of the view that a case to ease monetary policy further might emerge. ", " In considering whether or not to reduce the cash rate further at this meeting, members saw benefit in allowing some time for the structure of interest rates and the economy to adjust to the earlier change. They also saw advantages in receiving more data to indicate whether or not the economy was on the previously forecast path. Further, they noted the greater degree of uncertainty about the behaviour of borrowers and savers in a world of very low interest rates. Taking account of all these factors, members judged it appropriate to hold the cash rate steady for the time being, while recognising that further easing over the period ahead may be appropriate to foster sustainable growth in demand while maintaining inflation consistent with the target. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent. "]}},

Measures of global headline and core inflation rates had remained subdued in April. ", " Following a moderation in growth in the March quarter, some of the recent Chinese data had been more positive. Growth of industrial production and retail sales had picked up a little and conditions in the property market had improved somewhat, particularly in the larger cities. However, growth of fixed asset investment, particularly in the real estate sector, had eased further. While the production of steel had increased over recent months, its rate of growth remained significantly lower than earlier trends. The Chinese trade data had indicated weakness in both exports and imports in recent months, although imports of Australian iron ore had continued to rise. Members noted that the Chinese authorities had eased a number of policies and announced initiatives intended to support growth. ", " In Japan, national accounts data for the March quarter showed that economic activity had grown at a moderate pace. Wage growth had increased over the past year and the unemployment rate had declined to its lowest level in almost 20 years. For the remainder of east Asia, GDP had grown slightly below its average pace of recent years in the March quarter and both headline and core inflation had eased. In India, economic conditions had improved over the past year or so. ", " In the United States, indicators of activity had been mixed, though more positive than suggested by the weak March quarter GDP data, which had largely reflected temporary factors. Labour market conditions had continued to improve and consumption growth had remained relatively strong. Business activity indicators had generally remained positive, though they were a little weaker than late in the preceding year. ", " Economic conditions in the euro area had continued to improve, but the recovery remained modest and inflation continued to be well below the European Central Bank's target. ", " Overall, commodity prices had been little changed since the previous meeting. The prices of coal and base metals had fallen, while the price of iron ore had increased. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the March quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. The data available prior to the meeting suggested that GDP growth had been close to average in the quarter, although below average on a year-ended basis. Growth in household consumption for the March quarter was expected to have been around average, while both dwelling investment and resource exports appeared to have been growing strongly. In contrast, business investment was likely to have contracted. There continued to be spare capacity in product and labour markets, despite some improvement in labour market conditions over the past six months or so. ", " Members observed that the Australian Government Budget for 2015/16 had outlined a number of years of slightly larger deficits than had been forecast in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook update in December 2014. This mainly reflected lower commodity prices and weaker-than-expected growth of incomes. Members were informed that the budget policies were little different from what had been assumed for the forecasts presented in the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. Members discussed the importance of including the fiscal positions of the states and territories in any assessment of the effect of fiscal consolidation on the aggregate economy. ", " Growth of retail sales volumes had been around average in the March quarter. Measures of consumer sentiment had picked up noticeably in May to be a bit above average. Much of this had been attributed to the Australian Government Budget and, in particular, the announcement of tax concessions for small businesses. Liaison suggested that there had been little change in the year-ended growth of the value of retail sales in April and May. ", " Dwelling investment looked to have grown strongly in the March quarter and forward-looking indicators of construction activity pointed to a further pick-up. Members noted that conditions in the established housing market had continued to vary across the country. Although housing price inflation had remained high in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, in Melbourne over recent months, there had been some divergence in price developments for different segments of these markets; price inflation of detached houses had increased, whereas price inflation for units had eased in both cities. Noting that housing price growth in other cities and regional areas had declined over recent months, members discussed the strength and composition of underlying supply and demand conditions in different parts of the housing market. They also observed that there was a relatively low stock of dwellings for sale in Sydney and Melbourne and that dwellings took only a short time to sell. ", " Members noted that housing credit growth overall had been broadly steady at around 7 per cent (on a six-month-ended annualised basis), though the latest data on loan approvals had showed a pick-up. Over the past six months or so, growth in investor credit had eased back to be running at an annualised pace of a bit above 10 per cent. However, over more recent months there had been solid increases in housing loan approvals to both owner-occupiers and investors, particularly in New South Wales, following earlier declines. ", " The available data suggested that private business investment had declined further in the March quarter, consistent with the forecast presented in the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. Mining investment appeared to have fallen further, while non-mining investment looked to have been little changed over recent quarters. Members observed that there were diverging trends within the non-mining sector. Investment in some sectors, such as real estate and retail trade, had picked up in response to stronger growth in domestic demand, but investment had continued to fall in other sectors, such as manufacturing, where the rate of investment had been lower than the rate of depreciation in recent years. Members noted that a lower exchange rate would have an immediate beneficial effect on some sectors, such as tourism, but that it would need to be lower for a sustained period to have a significant effect on large investment decisions in other trade-exposed sectors. ", " Surveys of business conditions remained a bit above their long-run averages in April. In contrast, an economy-wide measure of business confidence had remained below its long-run average level, along with various measures of capacity utilisation. Also, the second reading from the ABS capital expenditure survey of businesses' investment intentions for 2015/16 implied a fall in non-mining investment. ", " Trade data suggested that export volumes had increased strongly in the March quarter across most categories, including bulk commodities. Import volumes also appeared to have increased strongly, though capital imports had remained lower than their peak in 2012. ", " The labour force data continued to suggest that growth in employment and hours worked had been stronger over the past six months or so than the preceding period and the unemployment rate had been relatively stable at around 6¼ per cent. In April, employment had been little changed, the participation rate had ticked down and the unemployment rate had increased slightly to 6.2 per cent. Forward-looking indicators suggested that employment growth would be only modest in the coming months and most measures of job advertisements and vacancies were little changed since mid to late 2014. ", " Wage growth had declined a little further in the March quarter and remained lower than suggested by the historical relationship between wage growth and the unemployment rate. The rise in the private sector component of the wage price index had been the lowest outcome for many years (with the exception of the September quarter 2009) and wage growth over the year to March was below its decade average in all industries. Wage growth in the public sector had also remained low, in part because of delayed negotiations over enterprise bargaining agreements. Members considered several possible explanations for the slow growth of wages, including a more flexible labour market, the relatively long period of gradually rising unemployment over recent years and below-average levels of inflation expectations generally. "], "Financial Markets": [" Financial markets continued to focus on the current negotiations between Greece and its official sector creditors and the likely timing of interest rate rises in the United States. A sharp rise in 10-year bond yields was the main development across the major financial markets over the past month. ", " Members noted that the global rise in sovereign bond yields had been led by longer-maturity German Bunds, with those yields rising by as much as 65 basis points after reaching a historic low in mid April. The rise in yields was viewed primarily as a correction from unduly low levels, rather than a reaction to economic developments, and the sell-off only returned yields to their still low levels of late last year. ", " Longer-term sovereign yields in most other developed countries, including Australia, also rose significantly, while increases in yields on emerging market sovereign debt were generally smaller. Following the release of the Australian Government Budget, the Australian Office of Financial Management announced updated financing requirements for 2015/16, with net issuance of Australian Government Securities expected to be around $40 billion and net debt peaking at around 18 per cent of GDP in 2016/17. ", " In relation to the continuing negotiations between Greece and its official sector creditors, members observed that sizeable differences remained regarding the most substantive issues, including pensions and labour market reforms. Greece had been able to meet its scheduled payments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in May, but Greek officials had cautioned that payments due to the IMF in June would be difficult to make without an agreement being reached with the official sector creditors. Members also noted that, consistent with reports of deposit outflows, Greek banks' use of emergency liquidity assistance had increased further during April and May. ", " In the United States, expectations about the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate had changed little over the past month, with market pricing suggesting it would happen around the end of 2015, even though comments from the Federal Reserve suggested that the first increase would occur a little sooner than that. The People's Bank of China had moved to ease monetary policy further in May when it announced another reduction in both benchmark lending and deposit rates in response to low inflation and slower growth in economic activity. ", " Turning to foreign exchange markets, members noted that the US dollar had reversed its recent modest depreciation against most currencies, reaching its highest level against the yen since December 2002. The Chinese renminbi was little changed against the US dollar over the past month, although it had appreciated further on a trade-weighted basis and had been assessed by the IMF as being no longer undervalued. The Australian dollar had depreciated over May to be a little above its trough in early April on a trade-weighted basis. ", " Equity prices in the major markets had shown little net change since the previous meeting. The broad index for Chinese equities had increased by 2 per cent over the past month, although the index had been volatile. Members also noted the high-profile collapses in the prices of two Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies in mid May. Australian equity prices had underperformed the major markets over May. ", " Pass-through of the reduction in the Australian cash rate target in May to lending and deposit rates had varied across domestic financial institutions and products. At the same time, a number of banks were reported to have tightened conditions on new loans to property investors and imposed restrictions on the extent of interest rate discounts. Members noted that it would take some time for the full effects of such changes to be evident in the housing loan approvals and credit data. ", " Market pricing indicated that the cash rate target was expected to remain unchanged at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that information becoming available over the past month had not led to any material change to the global outlook, which was for growth of Australia's major trading partners to be around average over the period ahead. After somewhat weaker-than-expected economic conditions in China earlier in the year, the authorities had eased a range of policies and announced initiatives to support growth, and some of the recent data had been slightly more positive. The Federal Reserve was expected to begin the process of raising its policy interest rate later this year, but some other major central banks were continuing to ease policy. Commodity prices had been mixed over the month and little changed overall, and were significantly lower than a year earlier. ", " Domestically, the available data suggested that output growth had continued at a below-trend pace over the past year and would remain a little below trend in the period ahead before picking up to around trend in the latter part of 2016. The national accounts data for the March quarter were expected to show that the key forces operating on the economy were much as they had been for some time. After picking up late last year, growth of household expenditure was expected to have remained strong, supported by low interest rates and strong population growth. Conditions in the housing market in Sydney and parts of Melbourne had remained very strong, though trends were more mixed in other cities. Survey-based measures of business conditions had remained around average levels. There continued to be spare capacity in labour and product markets, although there had been some improvement in labour market conditions over the past six months or so. Inflationary pressures remained well contained and were likely to remain so in the period ahead. ", " The exchange rate was close to the lowest levels seen earlier in the year, but members noted that the current level of the exchange rate, particularly on a trade-weighted basis, continued to offer less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy. A further depreciation therefore seemed both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in commodity prices over the past year. ", " Overall, in assessing domestic conditions and the international environment, the Board's assessment was that the stance of monetary policy should be accommodative. Having eased policy at the previous meeting, members judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged and to assess information on economic and financial conditions as it became available. These data would inform the Board's assessment of the state of the economy and the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy would most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

The forecast for growth in 2015 and 2016 had been revised down slightly, but growth was expected to remain around its long-run average. The increase in global industrial production had slowed over the past year or so, particularly in the Asian region, and this had contributed to lower commodity prices. Members noted that, as a result, the forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised down since that presented at the May meeting. Globally, core inflation had been stable in year-ended terms over recent months at rates below the targets of most central banks. Monetary conditions had remained very accommodative. ", " In China, GDP growth had picked up in the June quarter to be 7 per cent in year-ended terms. However, growth in a range of other indicators of activity had moderated in the first half of 2015. The outlook for Chinese steel demand remained subdued. This had contributed to lower forecasts for iron ore prices, although they were expected to remain above levels seen earlier in the year. Members reviewed evidence that showed conditions in the residential property markets in China had improved further in recent months, but noted that this had not translated into a pick-up in residential property investment outside the largest cities. They observed that downside risks stemming from the weak property market and constraints on local government funding for infrastructure investment had receded somewhat, partly in response to policy measures designed to address these areas. The recent volatility in Chinese equity markets was not expected to have a significant direct effect on consumption, given the relatively limited direct exposure of households to equities. ", " Economic activity in Japan appeared to have been recovering gradually, but had yet to surpass the levels seen before the increase in the consumption tax in 2014. Nevertheless, the labour market remained relatively tight, wage growth had been higher than a year earlier and the Bank of Japan expected inflation to pick up to the 2 per cent target by around mid 2016. Across the rest of east Asia, output growth looked to have been below average in the June quarter, owing to weakness in both domestic demand and exports. In India, growth in industrial production had strengthened over the past year and a range of indicators pointed to further growth in investment. ", " In the United States, the economy had returned to moderate growth in the June quarter, following temporary weakness earlier in the year. Business investment was around average as a share of nominal GDP and recent indicators were consistent with above-trend growth in consumption in the period ahead. Members observed that lower oil prices should have a net positive effect on output growth in the United States, while recognising that the oil and gas sector had been adversely affected by the lower prices for its output and that households had saved some of the gains from lower fuel prices. Employment growth had strengthened in the June quarter and the unemployment rate had continued to trend lower, while wage growth had been surprisingly low and underlying inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's target. ", " The gradual recovery in the euro area had continued, supported by very accommodative monetary policy and low oil prices. Output growth appeared to have picked up in the first half of 2015 and unemployment rates in most countries continued to record modest falls. Members noted that there was considerable variation in outcomes across the euro area; sentiment had been rising in a number of countries but had declined in others, most notably Greece. Core inflation had stabilised in year-ended terms, but remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). Developments in Greece appeared to date to have had little effect on economic conditions or confidence in the region as a whole. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The Board's discussion of the domestic economy commenced with the observation that GDP growth over the next couple of years was expected to be slightly lower than forecast in May, although the revision was minor relative to the usual range of uncertainty. A downward revision to population growth had contributed to lower forecast growth in consumption and non-mining business investment. The forecasts for growth in public demand and business investment had been revised lower in light of new data. In contrast, the recent exchange rate depreciation had led to an upward revision to net exports. Aggregate growth was expected to remain moderate for a time before strengthening. Members recognised that the period of significant structural change for the Australian economy associated with the winding down of the mining investment boom would continue for some time. ", " Members noted that labour market conditions had been a little better than expected over the previous few months, although spare capacity still remained. The unemployment rate had been around 6 per cent in June, after having stabilised over the course of the past year, in contrast to earlier expectations that the unemployment rate would continue to drift higher. This stabilisation was consistent with both stronger-than-expected demand for labour and lower-than-expected population growth. Members discussed the role that low wage growth had played in the pick-up in the employment-to-population ratio over the past year. They noted that the ABS measure of firms' job vacancies was consistent with the unemployment rate remaining around current levels or even declining a little further in the months ahead. Other forward-looking indicators suggested moderate growth in employment in the near term. ", " The unemployment rate was expected to be a little lower than previously forecast, despite the revised growth profile, partly because the unemployment rate had been lower than expected in the June quarter, and partly because the revision to forecast aggregate demand had been broadly matched by a revision to forecast growth of the economy's productive capacity as a result of lower population growth. However, members noted that there would always be uncertainty about the balance between the growth of aggregate demand and supply. ", " Members noted that the key forces operating on the domestic economy had remained much as they had been for some time. Consumption growth had picked up a little since 2013 and the most recent data on retail sales and liaison information were consistent with the momentum in consumption growth being sustained. In addition, measures of consumer sentiment had remained around average levels. The forecast for consumption growth implied a further gradual decline in the saving ratio in an environment of continued low wage growth. The uncertainties around future consumption and saving decisions of households were discussed. ", " Housing market conditions had remained strong, supported by low interest rates. House price inflation continued to be strongest in Sydney and Melbourne, while price growth for apartments in these cities had been less rapid, consistent with increased construction of higher-density housing. Outside the two largest cities, housing price growth remained weak and prices had declined in some segments. Forward-looking indicators, such as building approvals and loan approvals for new dwellings, pointed to further strength in dwelling investment in coming quarters. ", " Housing credit growth had been stable over recent months at around 7 per cent on an annualised basis, while growth in credit to investors in housing had been steady at a bit above 10 per cent. Members noted that growth in credit to investors had been revised up as a result of a reclassification of one bank's loans, but that aggregate growth in housing credit had been unaffected. Members also noted that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) had announced an increase in the amount of regulatory capital the major banks and Macquarie Bank were required to hold for their residential mortgage exposures, to take effect in 2016. A number of banks had also announced increases in the standard variable rate for investor-related housing loans for new and existing borrowers of at least 25 basis points, and there had also been a tightening in lending conditions in this sector. ", " Non-mining business investment was expected to remain subdued for some time. Although little new information had been received since the previous meeting, survey measures of business conditions, confidence and capacity utilisation had been more positive. Members observed that survey measures of business conditions had been strongest for household and business services, which were also the sectors that had experienced the strongest employment growth over recent years. In contrast, business conditions and employment had been weaker in those sectors of the economy mainly involved in goods production and distribution. Members also noted that, on average, household services used significantly lower amounts of capital per worker than goods-related sectors and were not as well represented in the capital expenditure survey, which by itself implied a weaker forecast profile for non-mining business investment for 2015/16. Members acknowledged that there remained considerable uncertainty around the timing and strength of the recovery in non-mining business investment. ", " Export volumes appeared to have declined in the June quarter following a strong increase in the previous quarter. The weakness in resource exports partly reflected some temporary factors affecting coal and liquefied natural gas production, but a moderation in demand from China may have contributed to lower iron ore exports. Net service exports had made a strong contribution to output growth over the past year, supported by the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. ", " Inflation in the June quarter had been broadly as expected and domestic inflationary pressures had remained well contained. The consumer price index had increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter (in seasonally adjusted terms) and by 1.5 per cent over the year. The quarterly outcome reflected a rebound in the price of fuel, although it was still around 10 per cent lower than a year earlier. The various measures suggested that underlying inflation was around ½ per cent in the June quarter and 2¼ per cent over the year. ", " Members noted that spare capacity in the labour market and the low growth of labour costs were reflected in low inflation for market services, while inflation in the cost of new dwellings had remained strong, particularly in Sydney. Domestic cost pressures were expected to remain contained over the forecast period. The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) had declined modestly in the June quarter and over the preceding year. However, members observed that the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar would place further upward pressure on the final prices of tradable items over the next few years, which had led to a slight upward revision to the inflation forecast. Underlying inflation was expected to be around 2½ per cent over the forecast period, consistent with the inflation target. "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board's discussion of financial markets commenced with a focus on the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy. While policy was unchanged at the July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, recent commentary from Fed officials continued to suggest that policy tightening could start at the September meeting, whereas financial markets had only fully priced in a rate increase by December. Members noted that when the Fed actually delivered its first interest rate increase in nine years, there was likely to be a sizeable market impact notwithstanding how well telegraphed the change in policy had been. It was likely that financial market volatility would increase and the US dollar could appreciate further, including against the Australian dollar and a number of other currencies in Asia. ", " The US dollar had appreciated over the past month, particularly against the currencies of commodity exporters, including those of Australia as well as Canada and New Zealand, where the central banks had eased policy in July. The Australian dollar had depreciated by 5 per cent against the US dollar and by 4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, taking the exchange rate to around its lowest level since 2009 on both measures. The New Zealand dollar had also depreciated sharply against the US dollar to a level that was around 15 per cent lower than in late April. ", " In sharp contrast, the Chinese renmimbi had continued to be little changed against the US dollar. Chinese international reserves had declined by around 7 per cent in recent quarters to help achieve stability against the US dollar in the face of an outflow of capital. Chinese equity markets remained volatile, despite measures introduced by the Chinese Government in early July that had steadied the Chinese equity market for a time. Large falls in Chinese equity prices had occurred again more recently, resulting in cumulative falls from recent peaks being back around 30 per cent, although equity prices remained 70 per cent higher than a year earlier. ", " Equity prices in the advanced economies had generally been little changed over the past month. This included the euro area, where equity prices had been more volatile but had recovered their earlier falls when Greece had moved closer to an agreement with its creditors. Australian equity prices had risen since the end of June. ", " Turning to developments in Greece, members noted that the Greek Government and its official sector creditors had reached an agreement to start negotiations on a new three-year bailout program. Much of the program would be used to refinance existing obligations as they fell due, as well as to recapitalise the Greek banks. The Eurogroup had arranged a €7 billion bridging loan to enable Greece to meet its short-term commitments, including clearing its arrears at the International Monetary Fund and repaying a maturing bond held by the ECB. Greek banks had reopened on 20 July following the ECB's decision to increase its emergency lending assistance, but capital controls remained in place. ", " Government bond yields in the major economies had mostly fallen over the past month, mainly fluctuating alongside market concerns about Greece. Bond yields in Australia had largely tracked those in the United States over the past month. With state issuance of bonds projected at modest levels, spreads and yields on state government debt remained low. ", " Australian financial market pricing indicated no likelihood of an easing of monetary policy at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Global economic conditions were expected to continue to be supported by the lower level of oil prices and accommodative global financial conditions. Global industrial production growth had eased further this year, particularly in the Asian region, and this had contributed to lower commodity prices. Growth of Australia's major trading partners was expected to be around its long-run average over the next two years. Members observed that the downside risks to the outlook for Chinese growth identified over the past year had receded somewhat, although the Government's policy response to the recent volatility in Chinese equity markets had clouded the medium-term economic outlook. Uncertainties arising from the expected start of monetary policy tightening in the United States had moved into sharper focus. ", " Domestically, economic activity had generally been more positive over recent months. Very low interest rates were continuing to support strong growth in dwelling investment and consumption, and the further depreciation of the Australian dollar was expected to impart stimulus to the economy through stronger net exports. Although surveys of business investment intentions and non-residential building approvals suggested that non-mining business investment would remain subdued for some time, members noted that non-mining business profits had increased, business conditions were clearly above average and businesses had been hiring more labour, partly encouraged by very low wage growth. As a result, employment had risen as a share of the working age population and the unemployment rate had been relatively stable, in contrast to earlier expectations of a further increase. The recent data on inflation were largely as expected. ", " Members noted that output growth was expected to pick up gradually from its below-average pace over the past year to exceed 3 per cent in 2017. The forecast for the unemployment rate had been revised lower since the previous forecasts had been presented. The further depreciation of the Australian dollar had resulted in a slight upward revision to the forecast for inflation. Nonetheless, inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the forecast period given that domestic cost pressures were likely to remain well contained. ", " Credit was growing moderately overall, with growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. House prices continued to rise strongly in Sydney and Melbourne, but trends had been more varied in a number of other cities. Members observed that recent responses by banks to the suite of measures implemented by APRA in respect of lending to investors in housing, including a tightening in lending conditions, would be expected to reduce the risks relating to the housing market, although it was too early to gauge their full effects. ", " Members noted that an accommodative monetary policy setting remained appropriate given the forecasts, while observing that the Australian economy had been adjusting to the shift in activity in the resources sector from the investment to the production phase. This shift had been accompanied by significant declines in key commodity prices and was being assisted by the depreciation of the exchange rate over recent months. ", " In light of these considerations, the Board judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged. New information about economic and financial conditions would continue to inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and determine whether the current stance of policy remained appropriate to foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with target.

"], "Others Present": [" Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "Financial Markets": [" The discussion of financial markets opened with members observing that the marked increase in financial market volatility over the past month had mainly been a response to concerns about the resilience of the global economy, stemming primarily from developments in China. Much of the volatility had occurred in equity markets, with fixed income and foreign exchange markets generally exhibiting less volatility. ", " Members discussed the implications of the changes in mid August to the manner in which the People's Bank of China (PBC) set the daily fixing rate for the renminbi (RMB) against the US dollar, which had resulted in that exchange rate depreciating by around 4½ per cent over the course of a few days. The Chinese authorities had indicated that the intention of the change was to make the RMB more market based. While the resulting depreciation of the RMB spot exchange rate against the US dollar was the largest since 1994, it was not out of line with short-term movements sometimes seen between the major freely floating currencies. Members noted that the depreciation had offset only a little of the sizeable appreciation of the RMB in trade-weighted terms that had occurred over the previous year in the face of a slowing Chinese economy, as the RMB had appreciated in line with the US dollar over that period. ", " After the initial depreciation, the RMB had been relatively stable against the US dollar. Members noted that the Chinese authorities had for some time been selling foreign exchange reserves to prevent the RMB from depreciating against the US dollar in the face of significant capital outflows. This contrasted with the experience in the previous decade, during which foreign reserves had been accumulated to limit the appreciation of the RMB in the face of capital inflows. Members noted that it was not clear which assets the Chinese authorities had sold as part of the recent intervention nor which assets were being bought by those taking capital out of China, but given the potential size of these flows, their effects on asset markets could be large. ", " To counter the liquidity drain from sales of foreign exchange reserves following the foreign exchange intervention, the PBC had reduced reserve requirements on Chinese banks by another 50 basis points in late August. The PBC had also lowered its benchmark lending and deposit rates by a further 25 basis points. ", " The depreciation of the RMB had had an immediate effect across much of Asia, with many Asian currencies depreciating and some central banks in the region reportedly intervening to stabilise their currencies. The Australian dollar had depreciated along with the RMB, but had quickly rebounded within a day or so. A few days later the Australian dollar fell very briefly to US$0.705, during a short-lived period of dislocation in foreign exchange markets. Over the course of August, the Australian dollar depreciated by 2½ per cent against the US dollar and by 1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The euro and yen had both appreciated notably against the US dollar over this period. The appreciation of the euro was somewhat at odds with other movements in financial prices, but appeared to reflect the closing out of carry trades that had been funded in euro. ", " Global equity prices experienced large swings over August and in net terms had declined sharply, mainly reflecting heightened concerns about China. Chinese equity prices had declined by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> over August – with very large daily and intra-day movements – and were more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> below their peak in June, although still over <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 per cent</span> above the levels reached in mid 2014. ", " The Australian equity market had also fallen sharply to around the levels of two years earlier, despite company profit results being consistent with expectations. Large falls in commodity prices over the past few years had resulted in the share prices of commodity producers falling to their lowest levels in a decade. In addition, share prices of financial sector entities had fallen substantially, particularly after two of the major banks announced substantial capital raisings. ", " Turning to the United States, commentary from Federal Reserve officials had been suggesting that a tightening of monetary policy in the United States could start at the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Members noted, however, that the recent volatility in global financial markets had led to market expectations of an increase in the federal funds rate receding substantially, with only a one-in-three chance of an increase at the September meeting and an increase not fully priced in until early next year. As noted at previous Board meetings, it was possible that the first increase in the federal funds rate in around nine years could have significant effects on financial markets despite the fact that it had been well telegraphed. ", " Members noted that, in stark contrast to the large movements in equity prices, yields on 10-year US Treasuries had changed little in net terms during the recent period of equity market volatility. Australian bond yields had moved broadly in line with US yields. Bond yields in some emerging markets, including Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia, had risen sharply, but in others, such as Mexico, they were little changed. ", " Financial market pricing indicated that the domestic cash rate was expected to remain unchanged at the current meeting. "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that growth in the GDP of Australia's major trading partners had eased in the June quarter as a result of weaker conditions in Japan and other east Asian economies, but remained close to its long-run average. Growth in industrial production, including in China, had eased further over recent months, while economic conditions in the United States and the euro area continued to improve. Globally, core inflation had generally been stable, but at levels below the targets of most central banks, and monetary conditions remained very accommodative. Weaker demand for commodities from China had resulted in falls in the prices of bulk commodities and base metals over the course of the year to date. ", " In China, data on economic activity in July suggested that growth had continued to ease. Members noted that this presented a downside risk to the overall outlook for growth in China over the coming year, although they recognised that it was too early to assess accurately the effect of several recent policy changes designed to support activity. Members also observed that growth in retail sales had been relatively stable and monthly data contained relatively little information about service sectors, which were becoming increasingly important for growth of the Chinese economy. Growth in fixed asset investment had continued to decline and, although conditions in some segments of the property sector had improved, it was likely to be some time before the existing stock of newly constructed dwellings was sold and residential property investment picked up. Production of many industrial products, including steel, had declined since the previous year, but iron ore imports from Australia had nonetheless continued to increase. Inflation remained below the central bank's target level, which provided scope for further policy easing should that be required. Members noted that the recent volatility in Chinese equity markets was not expected to have a significant direct effect on the near-term economic outlook. ", " In Japan, output contracted in the June quarter and core inflation had remained steady. While inflation was still below the Bank of Japan's 2 per cent target, it had increased over the past two years and was likely to continue to be underpinned by further modest growth in base wages, which in turn reflected very tight labour market conditions. GDP growth had fallen in other east Asian economies in the June quarter, with trade volumes contracting and business investment growth slowing. Some of the weakness in trade values could be attributed to falls in intra-regional trade, part of which owed to the effect of lower oil prices. Indian GDP continued to grow at a solid pace and CPI inflation remained below the Reserve Bank of India's target for 2015. ", " The US economy appeared to have grown at an above-average pace around the middle of the year, which was consistent with further increases in employment and reductions in spare capacity in the labour market. Growth in household consumption had picked up to an above-average pace over the year to the June quarter, while growth in business investment had eased, in part reflecting weaker conditions in the oil sector. Core inflation in the United States appeared to have been increasing on an annualised basis since the start of the year. ", " Growth in the euro area economy had picked up a little over the past few quarters, although there was significant spare capacity across Europe and inflation remained well below the target of the European Central Bank. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that the June quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. Following the strong outcome in the March quarter, GDP growth in the June quarter was expected to be weak, partly reflecting a fall in resource export volumes as a result of temporary disruptions to production. GDP growth was expected to remain below average in year-ended terms, but members recognised that a number of indicators of domestic economic activity had shown some improvement over recent months. ", " Members began their discussion of the recent economic data by considering indicators of business conditions. Surveys of business conditions generally had shown further improvement over recent months and conditions were clearly above average levels in the household and business service sectors. Although survey measures suggested that business profits had increased to above-average levels, ABS data showed that, relative to nominal GDP, mining profits had declined further following falls in commodity prices and non-mining profits had remained relatively stable. ", " The ABS capital expenditure survey had suggested a further fall in mining investment in the June quarter and investment intentions in that sector implied a further sizeable fall in 2015/16, which was consistent with the Bank's current forecasts. Members discussed the implications of the recent emphasis on cost cutting in the mining sector, noting that it would probably lead to mining investment eventually stabilising at a lower level than had previously been expected. The capital expenditure survey also pointed to a decline in non-mining investment in 2015/16, but by less than implied by the survey taken three months earlier. Approvals for non-residential building also remained weak. ", " Members noted that differences in business conditions across the services and goods-related sectors of the economy were apparent in surveys as well as a range of other indicators of activity. In particular, above-average conditions in the household and business service sectors were consistent with the growth in employment and investment in those sectors. In contrast, although surveys of business conditions had improved for sectors related to the production and distribution of goods to be at around average levels, employment and investment in those industries had been little changed for some time. In addition, firms in these industries had indicated that they expected further falls in their overall investment over the year ahead. ", " Members observed that recent indicators of consumer sentiment and retail sales had been consistent with some increase in consumption growth. They also noted that conditions in the housing market overall had remained strong and that housing price inflation nationally had risen since the beginning of the year, notwithstanding regional disparities. In particular, the strength in housing price inflation had been concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, mainly for detached houses, whereas housing price inflation had been modest in other parts of the country and negative in some market segments. Members noted that rapid growth in the construction of new apartments had helped to hold down inflation of their prices. ", " There had been a notable decline in the growth in lending for investment housing in July. Recent revisions to data submitted by two major banks implied that growth in credit for investment housing over the year to June had been stronger than earlier reported and growth in credit for owner-occupied housing commensurately weaker. Dwelling investment appeared to have declined slightly in the June quarter, but had been strong over the year. Forward-looking indicators had generally suggested further strength in the coming months. ", " Employment continued to grow strongly in July and the employment-to-population ratio had increased to its highest level since 2013. Nevertheless, spare capacity remained in the labour market – the increase in the unemployment rate in July had been accompanied by a pronounced increase in the participation rate, particularly among females. Forward-looking indicators of labour market conditions had been mixed; some were consistent with the unemployment rate remaining around current levels or even falling a little, while others pointed to a slight rise over coming months. ", " Indicators of wage inflation in the June quarter remained soft. The wage price index had been consistent with the Bank's forecast for a prolonged period of low wage inflation. Wage growth in all industries had been well below their decade averages, but there had been signs that wage growth may have stabilised somewhat in service sectors. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that the key news internationally over the past month had been developments in the Asian region. The weakening in Chinese economic activity combined with developments in Chinese financial markets had led to sharp declines in global equity prices. So far, this volatility had not impaired the functioning of other financial markets and funding remained readily available to creditworthy borrowers. Moreover, several recent policy measures designed to support activity in China had not yet had their full effect. Economic conditions in the United States and euro area had continued to improve, monetary policies globally remained very stimulatory and lower oil prices would support economic activity in most of Australia's trading partners. Overall, international economic developments had increased the downside risks to the outlook, but it was too early to assess the extent to which this would materially alter the forecast for GDP growth in Australia's trading partners to be around average over the next couple of years. ", " Domestically, the national accounts were expected to show that output growth had been weak in the June quarter, following a strong outcome in the March quarter partly as a result of temporarily lower resource exports. Over the past year, resource exports had grown strongly and further growth was in prospect as the production of liquefied natural gas ramped up. The depreciation of the Australian dollar in response to the significant declines in key commodity prices was also expected to support growth, particularly through a larger contribution from net service exports. ", " Recent data on investment intentions suggested that mining investment would continue to decline and non-mining business investment would remain subdued in the near term, despite survey measures of aggregate business conditions being above average. However, non-mining business investment was still expected to pick-up over time as a result of the depreciation of the exchange rate over the past year and a further gradual rise in household expenditure. ", " Members noted that very low interest rates would continue to support growth in dwelling investment and household consumption. There were indications that the measures implemented by APRA had slowed the growth in lending for investment housing. Dwelling prices continued to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends had been more varied across other cities. The Bank was continuing to work with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. Prices in most other asset markets had been supported by lower long-term interest rates, while equity prices had moved lower and been more volatile recently, in parallel with developments in global markets. ", " Although the demand for labour had improved, particularly in service sectors, members noted that spare capacity remained and wage pressures continued to be weak. As a result, domestic cost pressures were likely to remain well contained and offset the expected rise in the prices of tradable items over the next couple of years. Inflation was forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years. ", " Given these considerations, the Board judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged. Information about economic and financial conditions would continue to inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and whether the current stance of policy remained appropriate to foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

Growth in China looked to have eased a little further and this was likely to have contributed to further declines in iron ore and coal prices. Globally, the fall in oil prices in the second half of 2014 had led to lower inflation and was expected to provide additional support to demand in Australia's trading partners. Monetary policies remained very accommodative. ", " In China, the authorities had announced a target for GDP growth in 2015 of 7 per cent, ½ percentage point below the target for 2014. Recent indicators suggested that economic conditions had softened. Growth of fixed asset investment had been slowing, particularly in real estate and manufacturing, and prices of residential property and sales volumes had declined further. Members noted that the deterioration in conditions in the property market had increased the vulnerability of leveraged property developers and local authorities that relied on revenue from land sales to support their infrastructure investment. They also noted that the central authorities had indicated a willingness to adjust policies to support employment growth, while remaining committed to putting financing on a more sustainable footing. The weakness in the property market in China had flowed through to slower growth in the demand for steel, which had, in turn, contributed to the recent falls in iron ore prices, even though Chinese imports of Australian iron ore had continued to increase. ", " The modest recovery of the Japanese economy was continuing. Labour market conditions remained tight and the recent annual spring wage negotiations had resulted in several large companies increasing base wages by more than they did a year earlier. In the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, growth had continued at around its average pace of the past decade, although there had been variation in the composition of growth across the region. ", " Members observed that the US economy had continued to grow, but that the pace of growth may have moderated in the early months of this year partly in response to the temporary effects of adverse weather conditions and industrial action at some ports. Labour market conditions had strengthened further over the past six months or so; employment had increased at around its fastest pace in several years and the unemployment rate had declined further. Members noted that overall wage growth in the United States remained subdued. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had indicated that it was likely to begin the process of normalising interest rates in the second half of this year if economic conditions continued to evolve as expected. ", " In the euro area, economic activity had continued to recover gradually. The unemployment rate had declined a little further and there had been a noticeable lift in activity in some euro area periphery economies. Lower oil prices had reduced consumer price inflation significantly, but core measures of consumer price inflation had not changed much in recent months and remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). There had been some signs that conditions in the construction sector had stabilised and credit to both households and businesses was increasing, albeit gradually. ", " Members observed that bulk commodity prices had declined further over the past month. Although much of the decline over 2014 was driven by expansion in global supply, the slowing in growth of Chinese demand had contributed more recently. A small (but increasing) share of Australian iron ore production was estimated to be unprofitable at prevailing prices, while the decline in oil prices since the middle of 2014 was expected to lower the prices of Australian liquefied natural gas exports over the next few months. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" The December quarter national accounts, which were released the day after the March meeting, confirmed that the Australian economy had grown at a below-average pace over 2014. Members noted that growth in dwelling investment, consumption and resource exports had picked up, but that business investment had continued to fall and public demand had made little contribution to growth over the year. Recent indicators suggested that the below-trend pace of GDP growth had continued into the March quarter. ", " Overall conditions in the housing market had remained strong, supported by very low interest rates and relatively strong population growth. Housing prices had continued to rise strongly in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne, but growth in prices had eased recently in some other parts of the country. Other indicators of activity had also suggested strong conditions in the established housing market in Sydney and Melbourne. Housing credit overall had been growing at about 7 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms, while credit to investors had grown at a pace a little above 10 per cent on the same basis. Recent data on loan approvals suggested that growth in housing credit was likely to continue at this pace, but not accelerate, in the months immediately ahead. Meanwhile, new dwelling approvals and loan approvals for new construction were at high levels, pointing to strong growth in dwelling investment over coming quarters. ", " Household consumption had increased in the December quarter, supported by low interest rates and rising household wealth. Even so, growth in household consumption over the second half of 2014 had been slightly below average, reflecting subdued growth in household income, while the saving ratio had continued its gradual decline of the past two years. More timely data had indicated that growth in the value of retail trade in January and February was about average and that consumer confidence had been close to average levels. ", " Mining investment was estimated to have declined by 13 per cent over 2014 and an even larger decline was expected over 2015. Moreover, members observed that the recent declines in oil prices could lead to some scaling back of investment plans in the oil and gas sector. Non-mining investment had been subdued for some time. Forward-looking indicators (such as the ABS capital expenditure survey and non-residential building approvals) as well as liaison suggested that it was likely to remain subdued, and could even decline, over the next year or so. Members noted, however, that there had been a pick-up in growth of credit to businesses of late. They also observed that the strongest improvement in investment intentions (apparent in the recent capital expenditure survey) had been recorded for industries experiencing the strongest output growth, such as rental, hiring &amp; real estate and retail trade. More recently, survey measures of business confidence and capacity utilisation remained a little below average, while measures of business conditions were around average levels. ", " Members observed that there had been significant variation in the composition of domestic demand growth across the states over the course of 2014. Dwelling investment and consumption had contributed to growth in all states, whereas business investment had subtracted from growth in Queensland and Western Australia, mainly reflecting the decline in mining investment in these states. Members noted that public demand had contributed to domestic demand growth only in New South Wales and Victoria over the year and had made no contribution to output growth for the country as a whole. ", " Resource exports had grown strongly in the December quarter and there were early indications of strength in resource exports in the first few months of 2015. However, lower commodity prices were expected to lead to some reduction in the growth of production, and therefore exports, in 2015, particularly for coal. The data for recent quarters were consistent with the lower exchange rate having provided support to net exports, particularly for services. ", " Recent employment growth had been stronger than a year earlier, but it was still below the growth of the working-age population. Consequently, the unemployment rate had continued its gradual upward trend of recent years, notwithstanding a modest decline in February to 6.3 per cent. Other indicators, such as hours worked and the participation rate, had provided further evidence of spare capacity in the labour market. The various forward-looking indicators were stronger than a year earlier, but remained at levels consistent with only modest employment growth in the months ahead. ", " Members noted that the national accounts measures of wage growth had remained subdued. Combined with some pick‑up in labour productivity growth over recent years, this had meant that unit labour costs had not changed much for about three years. Various measures of inflation expectations had remained slightly below their longer-run averages. "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board's discussion of financial markets commenced with the unusual trading in the Australian dollar that occurred in the period immediately prior to the announcement of the Board's decisions in both February and March. Members noted that the illiquid conditions that existed in the foreign exchange market at that time meant that small trades could move the price by relatively large amounts, and that once such movements occurred it would be highly likely that algorithmic trading strategies would exacerbate such movements, particularly given the illiquid environment. Moreover, the occurrence of these movements meant that liquidity was likely to decline further as more liquidity providers pulled back from the market during this window. ", " Members were aware of the investigations currently being undertaken by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and were informed that internal work since the March meeting had not identified any evidence of procedural lapses or conduct that could have led to the early release of relevant information. ", " Global financial markets over the past month had continued to focus on the expected path of US monetary policy as well as the strained relationship between the Greek Government and its creditors. ", " Members noted that projections by members of the FOMC for the path of the federal funds rate had been revised down at the FOMC's March meeting. Those projections remained above market expectations, which had flattened further following the FOMC's reassessment and again after the release of weaker-than-expected employment data for March. Markets expected the first rise in the US federal funds rate to occur towards the end of the year. ", " Members also noted that negotiations between the new Greek Government and the European Commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund were fraught. As a result, there was some risk that Greece would not receive assistance funds in a timely fashion and the government would continue to rely on emergency measures to cover its liquidity needs. Greek banks in particular continued to face deposit outflows and had lost access to private funding markets, and as a result had increased their reliance on ECB funding. On a more positive note, members observed that there continued to be little contagion to other euro area periphery countries. ", " Members were briefed about the ECB's balance sheet expansion in March, mainly reflecting lending to banks under its latest targeted longer-term refinancing operation and the commencement of government bond purchases. The ECB had also announced in March that it would not purchase bonds that carried yields below the rate that it paid on deposits (at present –0.2 per cent), indicating that the ECB would need to buy relatively long-dated German Bunds. ", " Government bond yields in most of the major economies remained at very low levels. They had shown little net change in the United States and Japan, while yields on long-term German Bunds had declined further following the launch of the ECB's sovereign bond purchasing program. Domestically, longer-term government bond yields had also declined and the 10-year Australian bond yield was around its record low, with the spread to US yields close to its lowest level since 2001. ", " There were sizeable rises in equity prices in European and Japanese markets in March, while equity prices in China had increased by 15 per cent over the past month and by 90 per cent since the middle of 2014. In contrast, equity prices in Australia had been little changed in March. Prices of resource stocks remained under pressure. ", " The US dollar had appreciated a little further on a trade-weighted basis over March, taking the rise since July 2014 to 14 per cent. Over the same period, members observed that both the euro and the Australian dollar had depreciated by around 20 per cent against the US dollar. While the renminbi had both appreciated and depreciated at different times since July 2014, these moves had roughly netted out against the US dollar overall and the renminbi had therefore appreciated noticeably against most other currencies. Members also noted that the Australian dollar had recorded an all-time low against the New Zealand dollar. ", " Members concluded their discussion of financial markets with the observations that lending rates for business and housing in Australia had continued to edge down over the previous month, and that financial markets assigned a high probability to a reduction in the cash rate at the current meeting, and an even higher probability to a reduction occurring by the May meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members' overall assessment was that the outlook for global economic growth had not changed significantly over the past month and that it would be supported by stimulatory monetary policies and the fall in the price of oil since mid 2014. They observed that the apparent slowing of growth in China, in particular the further deterioration in conditions in the Chinese property market, had placed some additional downward pressure on the demand for steel and on the prices of Australia's key commodity exports. Conditions in global financial markets had remained very accommodative. Changes to the stance of monetary policy by any of the major central banks and further significant developments in Europe had the potential to affect financial market conditions in Australia, including the exchange rate, over the coming year. ", " Data available at the time of the meeting suggested that the Australian economy had continued to grow somewhat below trend in the December quarter and into the first quarter of 2015. There had been evidence to suggest that the growth in consumption and dwelling investment had picked up, supported by the very low levels of interest rates. Exports were also growing. However, a significant pick-up in non-mining business investment was yet to occur and several indicators suggested it would remain subdued for longer than had earlier been anticipated. At the same time, the recent declines in bulk commodity prices could, at the margin, lead to a larger-than-expected fall in mining investment and some decline in the production of iron ore and coal. Data for the labour market suggested that the economy was likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time and that labour market conditions were likely to remain subdued. As a result, wage pressures were expected to remain contained and inflation was forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next year or so. ", " Members remained alert to the possibility that the low levels of interest rates could foster imbalances in the housing market. The most recent data suggested that activity in the housing market had remained strong, but there had been little change to housing market conditions overall or in the growth of housing credit in early 2015. Although prices continued to rise rapidly in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne, trends elsewhere were more varied. Members noted that the Bank was working with other regulators to assess and contain risks arising from the housing market. ", " Overall, members considered that the current setting of monetary policy was accommodative and providing support to the economy. They also acknowledged that a lower exchange rate would help achieve more balanced growth in the economy. Further depreciation of the Australian dollar was likely given the recent declines in key commodity prices. ", " In considering whether or not to reduce the cash rate further at this meeting, members discussed the various channels through which monetary policy was affecting the economy at present, including the asset price and exchange rate channels. In assessing the operation of the cash flow channel in particular, they noted that the responsiveness of borrowers and savers to changes in interest rates and asset prices was unusually uncertain in a world of very low interest rates and high household leverage. Members also saw advantages in receiving more data, including on inflation, to assess whether or not the economy was on the previously forecast path and allowing more time for the economy to respond to the reduction in the cash rate earlier in the year. ", " Taking all these factors into account, the Board judged that it was appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the time being, while accepting that further easing of policy may be appropriate over the period ahead to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation consistent with the target. The Board would continue to assess the case for such action at forthcoming meetings. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent. "]}},
{"Date": ["Sydney – 7 July 2015"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury) ", " Members granted leave of absence to Heather Ridout AO and Catherine Tanna in terms of section 18A of the <em>Reserve Bank Act 1959</em>. "], "Others Present": [" Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Chris Ryan (Head, International Department), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" The Board's discussion about economic conditions opened with the observation that economic growth in Australia's major trading partners appeared to have been around average in the June quarter. Consumption growth had been little changed for most trading partners in recent months, although it was perhaps a bit stronger in the United States and somewhat weaker in China. The level of consumption in Japan remained well below that seen prior to the increase in the consumption tax in 2014. Core inflation rates had been stable in year-ended terms over recent months and remained below the targets of most central banks. Members also observed that trade volumes, particularly within the Asian region, appeared to have fallen recently. Consistent with this observation, growth in industrial production across a number of east Asian economies had slowed a little. ", " In China, there had been little change in the monthly indicators of economic activity, although conditions had been a bit more positive in some sectors than early in 2015. The Chinese property market had improved somewhat; residential property prices overall had risen for the first time in a year and floor space sold had increased in the past few months. Members reflected that the recent easing in monetary conditions would provide additional support to the property market and growth more broadly, although it could be some time before a significant pick-up in construction activity began. Recent efforts by central government authorities to increase infrastructure investment further and reform local government financing arrangements were also expected to support investment. ", " Commodity prices overall had fallen since the previous meeting, driven by iron ore and oil prices. Growth in crude steel production had been modest and steel prices had fallen noticeably over the past month. Iron ore production in China had continued to decline. Shipments of iron ore from Australia and Brazil appeared to have increased in June, which contributed to lower iron ore prices over the past month. ", " Following quite strong output growth in Japan in the March quarter, more timely indicators pointed to modest growth in the June quarter. Labour market conditions had continued to improve, resulting in the unemployment rate falling further and the ratio of jobs to applicants continuing to rise. Wage growth and financial market measures of inflation expectations were higher than a year earlier and were expected to feed into higher core inflation over time. Members considered the importance for Japan of policy reforms designed to address some longer-term structural challenges, such as the ageing of the population. ", " In the United States, recent data pointed to moderate growth in economic activity in the June quarter following weakness in the March quarter. The labour market had strengthened further, with growth in non-farm payrolls employment rebounding in April and May and the unemployment rate falling. While there had been some increase in measures of wage growth, core measures of inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's inflation target. ", " In the euro area, the available indicators pointed to modest economic growth and above-average sentiment in the June quarter, continuing the recent trend of improved conditions in the euro area as a whole. Members noted that exports had made a significant contribution to the pick-up in growth in the region but investment was still well below the levels seen prior to the global financial crisis. The unemployment rate had continued to fall modestly since its peak two years earlier, but varied sharply across the euro area; the unemployment rate was highest in Greece, where output was more than 25 per cent below its level prior to the financial crisis. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members noted that output had increased by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.3 per cent over the year. Resource exports had made a significant contribution to growth, reflecting better-than-usual weather conditions in the quarter. Dwelling investment had remained strong and while consumption growth had picked up over the past year or so, it had remained below average. Business investment had contracted in the quarter and there had been little growth in public demand. More recent economic indicators suggested that domestic demand had continued to grow at a below-average pace over recent months, but that labour market conditions had continued to improve. ", " Members observed that consumption grew faster than household income over the year to the March quarter. As a result, the saving ratio had declined further, although it remained well above the level it had been over much of the past 25 years. Year-ended growth in retail sales had been little changed over recent months and liaison suggested that this was likely to have continued into June. Retail sales growth had been relatively strong in New South Wales and Victoria but weaker in Queensland and Western Australia, in line with observed differences in economic conditions across the country. At the same time, surveys indicated that consumers had viewed their financial situation as being above average over the past year, notwithstanding the relatively weak growth in labour incomes. Members observed that this was likely to reflect the very low level of interest rates and strong growth in net household wealth. ", " Dwelling investment increased by 9 per cent over the year to the March quarter. An increase in the construction of new dwellings accounted for most of this growth, but the alterations and additions component had also contributed more recently, recording the first increase in a year in the March quarter. Forward-looking indicators pointed to further strong growth in dwelling investment in the period ahead. Members noted that there had been ongoing divergence in conditions in established housing markets across the country, as well as between houses and apartments. Housing prices had continued to rise rapidly in Sydney and to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Elsewhere, there had been little change in housing prices over the past six months or so. Prices of apartments had been growing less rapidly than those of houses, which members considered to be consistent with the relatively strong growth in the supply of higher-density housing in many capital cities. ", " Growth in housing credit overall had been stable over recent months at around 7 per cent on an annualised basis, while growth in lending to investors had been steady at a bit above 10 per cent. Members observed that the household debt-to-income ratio, calculated by netting funds held in mortgage offset accounts from total household debt to the financial sector, had increased over the year to March but had not exceeded previous peaks. Members discussed the fact that high housing prices had different implications for existing home owners, who benefited from increased wealth, and potential new home owners, who were finding it more difficult to finance a home purchase. ", " Investment in both the mining and non-mining sectors appeared to have fallen in the March quarter, although the split between the two components remained subject to some uncertainty. Profits for non-mining firms had increased by 6 per cent over the past year. More recent survey measures of business conditions, confidence and capacity utilisation had picked up to be around, or even above, their long-run averages. In contrast, private non-residential building approvals had remained weak. ", " The monthly trade data suggested that resource exports, including iron ore and coal, had declined in the June quarter. Coal exports had been affected by the severe storms in the Hunter region of New South Wales in late April. Members noted that there had been further signs of growth in service exports, in part a response to the depreciation of the exchange rate. Over the past year, net service exports had made a similar contribution to output growth as exports of iron ore, even though total import volumes had increased in the March quarter. ", " Labour force data indicated further signs of improvement in May. Employment growth had picked up over the year to exceed the rate of population growth. As a result, the unemployment rate had been relatively stable since the latter part of 2014 and had fallen slightly in May to 6 per cent. Members observed that employment growth had been strongest in household services and that employment and vacancies had been growing for business services but had remained little changed in the goods sector. As with other state-based indicators, employment growth and job vacancies had been strongest in New South Wales and Victoria. Forward-looking labour market indicators had been somewhat mixed over recent months. The ABS measure of firms' job vacancies overall suggested that demand for labour could be sufficient to maintain a stable or even falling unemployment rate in the near term, while other forward-looking indicators suggested only modest growth in employment in coming months. ", " Members noted that the latest estimates indicated that the population had increased by 1.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter, down from a peak rate of growth of 1.8 per cent over 2012. The slower growth was primarily accounted for by a decline in net immigration, which was particularly pronounced in Western Australia and Queensland, consistent with weaker economic conditions in those states. Members observed that the lower-than-expected growth in the population helped to reconcile the below-average growth in output over the past year with a broadly steady unemployment rate. ", " Despite recent improvements in labour market indicators, members reflected that there was still evidence of spare capacity in the labour market. Consistent with this, the latest national accounts data indicated that non-farm average earnings per hour had recorded the lowest year-ended outcomes since the early 1990s and that unit labour costs had been little changed for around four years. "], "Financial Markets": [" International financial markets were mainly focused on developments in Greece and the fall in Chinese equity markets over the past month. ", " Members were briefed on recent developments in Greece. The ‘no’ vote in the referendum on the creditors' latest proposals raised several issues, first among which was how the Greek authorities could reopen the banks. A critical vulnerability in the near term was related to whether the European Central Bank would provide additional emergency liquidity assistance. A second issue was how Greece would be able to service its external debt and a third was the challenges faced by the Greek authorities in improving the competitive position of the economy. Although these issues were of great concern to the Greek populace, the direct economic implications for the global economy and Australia were assessed by members to be relatively limited. They noted that the reaction of financial markets to these developments had been fairly muted. This was consistent with the economic and financial exposures to Greece – apart from the official sector's financial exposure – being quite low. ", " Members noted that spreads to 10-year German Bunds on comparable bonds issued by Italy, Spain and Portugal had not risen much, with the limited contagion from developments in Greece likely to have reflected a general view of markets that previous adjustment policies in those countries had been relatively successful. ", " Members then turned their discussion to developments in bond markets more generally. Yields on longer-maturity German Bunds and US Treasuries had risen sharply over the first half of June, with German 10-year yields reaching 1 per cent, compared with a historic low of 8 basis points in mid April. German yields declined somewhat following the announcement of the Greek referendum. Longer-term sovereign yields of most other developed countries, including Australia, tended to move in line with US Treasuries. ", " Expectations about the timing of the US Federal Reserve's first increase in the federal funds rate were little changed over the past month. Market pricing continued to suggest that the first increase would occur around the end of 2015. Although commentary by Federal Reserve officials suggested that it could be a little sooner than that, they continued to emphasise that the exact timing of the first increase would be less important than the pace of subsequent increases, which were expected to be gradual. ", " The People's Bank of China (PBC) eased monetary policy further in June by cutting benchmark deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points, citing low inflation and a consequent increase in real interest rates. In addition, the PBC announced cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for selected financial institutions. The Chinese authorities had also announced a proposal to allow banks more flexibility in their choice of funding mix and asset allocation, which could lead to an increase in the supply of credit over time. ", " The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 3.25 per cent, citing the decline in New Zealand's terms of trade and the disinflationary effect of stronger-than-expected labour force growth. ", " Global equity markets fell by 3 per cent over the course of June, with broad-based falls and price movements generally tending to reflect fluctuations in sentiment about Greece. The Chinese equity market also fell sharply in June, partly in response to what was only a modest tightening of restrictions on margin lending. Mainland share prices were still well above their levels of a year earlier but the sharpness of the recent fall prompted the Chinese authorities to announce a number of measures, including an indefinite suspension of initial public offerings, an equity stabilisation fund and a funding facility for brokers. The Australian equity market underperformed several other advanced economy markets in June, mainly reflecting falls in resources and consumer sector share prices. ", " Global foreign exchange markets were relatively subdued in June. The euro recorded only a modest and short-lived fall when markets opened after the announcement of the Greek referendum result. The Australian dollar was 3 per cent lower against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. ", " Corporate bond issuance in Australia had been strong over the course of 2015 to date, particularly by resource companies, although much of the increase reflected refinancing. ", " Pricing of Australian money market instruments suggested that the cash rate target was expected to remain unchanged at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that global economic conditions remained consistent with growth in Australia's major trading partners being around average over the period ahead. Global financial conditions were very accommodative and would remain so even in the event that the Federal Reserve started to raise its policy interest rate later in the year. Recent data suggested that conditions in Chinese property markets had improved and the authorities had acted to support activity by easing a range of policies further. Members noted that the recent volatility in Chinese equity markets and potential spillovers from developments in Greece would require close monitoring. ", " Domestically, the key forces shaping the economy over the past year were much as they had been for some time. Very low interest rates were working to support strong growth in dwelling investment and, together with strong housing prices, had supported consumption growth. Resource exports had made a substantial contribution to growth and mining investment had declined significantly, while public demand had been flat over the past year. Although output growth in the March quarter had been stronger than expected, growth over the year remained below average and early indications were that the strength in the March quarter had not carried through to the June quarter. Non-mining business investment had been subdued and surveys of businesses' investment intentions suggested that it would remain so over the coming year. Nevertheless, non-mining business profits had increased over the past year and surveys suggested that business conditions had generally improved over recent months to be a bit above average. ", " Conditions in the housing market had been little changed in the most recent months, with notable strength in Sydney. Housing credit growth had been steady and remained relatively strong for investors in housing, although it had not accelerated. Any effects of regulators' greater scrutiny of investor lending were probably not yet evident in the data. ", " Recent data indicated that employment had grown more rapidly than the population and the unemployment rate had been relatively stable since the latter part of the previous year. The easing in population growth over the past year helped to reconcile below-average growth in output with the relatively steady unemployment rate. Nevertheless, spare capacity remained, as evidenced by the level of the unemployment rate, historically low wage growth and unit labour costs that had been stable for a number of years. On this basis, members assessed that inflationary pressures were well contained and likely to remain so in the period ahead. ", " Commodity prices had fallen further and the Australian dollar had depreciated over the past month. Although the exchange rate against the US dollar was close to levels last seen in 2009, the decline in the Australian dollar had been more modest in terms of a basket of currencies. Members noted that the exchange rate had thus far offered less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy and that further depreciation seemed both likely and necessary. ", " In light of current and prospective economic circumstances and financial conditions, the Board judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate. Information to be received over the period ahead on economic and financial conditions would continue to inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy remained appropriate to foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

Minor revisions to the outlook largely reflected weaker growth in China in the March quarter, which had also been reflected in lower bulk commodity prices and hence a slightly lower terms of trade than previously forecast by staff. Monetary conditions remained very accommodative across the globe and low oil prices were also supporting growth of Australia's trading partners. Core inflation rates were below central banks' targets in many economies. ", " Economic growth in China had eased further in the March quarter across a broad range of indicators. The Chinese property market had continued to be a source of weakness in the economy and represented a key source of uncertainty for the outlook, both through the effects on demand for industrial products and on the finances of local governments that relied on land sales to fund infrastructure projects. Members noted that residential property prices had continued to fall, albeit at a more gradual pace, and sales were lower than in the previous year. Chinese demand for steel had eased and had been accompanied by a fall in Chinese iron ore production and relatively flat imports of iron ore, although Australian iron ore exports to China continued to grow. Members noted that the authorities had introduced several measures to address the overhang of housing supply, while the People's Bank of China (PBC) had lowered the reserve requirement ratio for banks. ", " Although the prices of iron ore, thermal coal and oil prices had rebounded somewhat from recent lows, members observed that the slowing in the growth of Chinese demand for steel had contributed to declines in the prices of bulk commodities since the start of 2015. As a result, the terms of trade had declined and were expected to continue doing so as lower spot prices gradually fed their way into contract prices for commodities, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). Notwithstanding this, members noted that the forecast terms of trade were considerably higher than they had been prior to the mid 2000s. ", " Growth in the US economy had moderated in the March quarter, largely reflecting the temporary effects of disruptions related to severe weather and industrial action in West Coast ports. Over the same period, conditions in the labour market had continued to improve. Non-farm payrolls employment had continued to grow strongly over the past six months and the unemployment rate had declined further. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had indicated that it was likely to begin the process of normalising interest rates in the second half of the year as long as economic conditions continued to evolve as expected. ", " Growth in the Japanese economy looked to have been modest in the March quarter and there were signs that tight labour market conditions were generating stronger wage growth. In the rest of east Asia, growth of both exports and domestic activity appeared to have slowed a little in the March quarter. Economic activity in the euro area had continued to recover gradually over past few months. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members observed that the forces underpinning developments in the domestic economy were much as they had been for some time. The available data suggested that growth in the domestic economy had continued at a pace a bit below average in the March quarter. Members noted that growth was expected to continue at a similar pace over the coming year before picking up gradually to an above-average pace over the course of 2016/17. ", " Household consumption growth had picked up late in 2014 and recent indicators were consistent with expectations that consumption would continue to rise gradually, supported by very low interest rates, relatively strong population growth and a gradual decline in the saving ratio. Members noted that if households respond to very low interest rates and higher asset prices to a similar degree as they had in the period prior to the global financial crisis, expected outcomes would include a lower saving ratio and higher consumption growth than embodied in the forecasts. Alternatively, if households were less inclined to bring forward their consumption than had been factored into the forecasts, perhaps to limit the increase in their leverage, consumption growth would be likely to be weaker and the saving ratio higher than forecast. ", " Conditions in the established housing market had remained strong in Sydney and Melbourne. However, across the rest of the country, which accounts for around 60 per cent of Australia's dwelling stock, housing price growth had declined. The available data suggested that dwelling investment had grown strongly in the March quarter, supported by low interest rates and above-average population growth. Forward-looking indicators, including residential building and loan approvals, suggested that dwelling investment would continue to grow strongly in the next few quarters. Members noted that growth of housing credit for both owner-occupiers and investors had remained relatively stable in recent months, with overall credit growth broadly in line with longer-term income growth. ", " Survey data had suggested that business conditions in the non-mining sector were around average and that business credit had picked up of late. However, forward-looking measures of business confidence had remained a little below average and non-residential building approvals had also been running at a relatively low level. Members noted that non-mining business investment was expected to recover later than had been thought at the time the forecasts for the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> had been prepared. This reassessment was consistent with the weak reading on investment intentions for 2015/16 from the December quarter ABS capital expenditure survey as well as business liaison by the Bank, which had suggested for some time that businesses would commit to increasing investment only after observing a durable improvement in the growth of demand. Members noted that exchange rate developments were also likely to remain important for investment decisions. Uncertainty about both the timing and speed of the recovery in non-mining business investment remained key risks to the forecasts. Mining investment was still expected to decline sharply, but the speed of that decline continued to be uncertain. ", " Resource export volumes had grown strongly in the March quarter, in part reflecting the absence of substantial weather-related disruptions across the country. Resource exports were expected to continue making a strong contribution to growth as new production, particularly of LNG, came on line over 2015. Members noted that the capacity to maintain production plans in the face of lower commodity prices had been enhanced by further cost-cutting by producers, and that this had been assisted by the decline in the price of oil (an input into production) over the past year. ", " Fiscal consolidation by the federal and state governments was expected to contribute to subdued growth of domestic demand over the forecast period. Members noted that the Commonwealth Budget, which would be announced the following week, would provide important information for updating these forecasts. ", " The most recent labour force data indicated that employment growth had been increasing over the past six months or more, to be a little above the rate of population growth. Members noted that the revised labour force data also indicated that the unemployment rate had been stable through most of this period at about 6¼ per cent, and observed that the extended period of slow wage growth may help to reconcile these data with the below-trend growth in the economy over 2014. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand had continued to point to modest growth of employment over coming months. ", " Members noted that the delayed pick-up in GDP growth in the revised outlook meant that the unemployment rate was forecast to rise further, before starting to decline gradually towards the end of the forecast period. Wage growth was not expected to increase from current low levels for some time. Members discussed the possibility that employment growth could grow fast enough such that the unemployment rate did not increase, especially if there was ongoing moderation in wage growth. ", " Inflation in the March quarter had been broadly as expected. CPI inflation had slowed over the past year, reflecting the large falls in fuel prices and repeal of the carbon price. Underlying inflation had remained around ½–¾ per cent in the quarter and 2¼–2½ per cent over the past year. Domestic inflationary pressures – as indicated by non-tradables inflation – had remained below average, consistent with the extended period of slower wage growth. Inflation in consumer prices related to housing was marginally above its historical average, driven by inflation in new dwelling costs reflecting the strength of the housing market. Tradables inflation (excluding volatile items and tobacco) had picked up in response to the depreciation of the Australian dollar over the past year or so. ", " Members noted that the inflation forecast had been revised down slightly since February, reflecting the expectation that growth of economic activity would remain below trend for a little longer than previously forecast. Domestic labour cost pressures were expected to remain well contained and underlying inflation was expected to remain consistent with the inflation target over the forecast period. Headline inflation was forecast to remain below 2 per cent in year-ended terms through to mid 2015, before picking up to be consistent with the inflation target thereafter. "], "Financial Markets": [" The Board's discussion of financial markets commenced with the unusual trading in the Australian dollar in the period immediately prior to the announcement of the Board's decisions in February, March and April. Members were briefed on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's preliminary finding, which had been announced the previous day, that each of those moves in the Australian dollar had been a result of ‘normal market operations in an environment of lower liquidity immediately ahead of the RBA announcement’. ", " Members observed that financial markets continued to focus on the situation in Greece and monetary policy developments in the major economies. ", " Negotiations between the Greek Government and its official sector creditors remained at an impasse. Greece appeared to have sufficient funds to meet its scheduled payments in May only after the introduction of further stopgap measures. The next Eurogroup meeting was scheduled for 11 May and at least partial agreement would be needed on Greece's reform agenda before further assistance funds were released. Overall, Greek banks' reliance on emergency liquidity assistance had increased significantly recently and total Eurosystem lending to Greek banks now exceeded one-quarter of their total liabilities. ", " Members noted that the apparent deadlock in Greece had had little impact on broader financial markets until recently, when spreads on the debt of other euro area periphery countries – including Portugal and Spain – had increased as concerns surrounding Greek finances continued to rise. ", " In contrast, yields on German and other highly rated European sovereign debt fell to new lows in April following the continued expansion of the European Central Bank's balance sheet, with the 10-year Bund yield declining to 8 basis points. In recent days, however, there had been a marked retracement, with 10 year yields rising by more than 30 basis points in Germany and the United States. ", " In the United States, market pricing continued to suggest that the first increase in the US policy rate could be closer to the end of the year, and the subsequent pace of policy tightening could be slower than that envisaged by members of the FOMC as published in mid March. ", " In China, the PBC had taken steps to boost liquidity by reducing the reserve requirement ratio. This step had partly sought to offset the reduction in liquidity resulting from sales of foreign reserves by the PBC in recent months. Equity prices had continued to record particularly large rises in mainland China, leading to prices more than doubling since mid 2014. Members noted that the rally in the Chinese share market had coincided with rapid growth in retail financial investments funded by debt, which raised concerns about the sustainability of the rise in share prices and the potential effects of any decline. ", " The appreciation of the US dollar since mid 2014 had continued its modest reversal over the past month, resulting in a depreciation of the US dollar against most currencies. Reflecting that, together with recent domestic data, the Australian dollar had appreciated by 3 per cent against the US dollar and by 2½ per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past month. Nevertheless, compared with its level in mid 2014, the Australian dollar remained around <span class=\"no-wrap\">17 per cent lower</span> against the US dollar and around 10 per cent lower on a trade-weighted basis. In contrast, the Chinese renminbi had been little changed against the US dollar over the past month and in trade-weighted terms remained around 12 per cent above its level in mid 2014. ", " Members noted that equity prices in the major developed economy markets had risen during April, with the exception of Europe, where equity prices fell a little after large rises earlier in the year. In Australia, equity prices also recorded a small decline in April, although the resources sector had outperformed, with energy sector share prices rising following an increase in the oil price. ", " Corporate bond issuance by Australian entities remained robust in both domestic and international markets amid favourable pricing conditions. In the money market, pricing on money market instruments pointed to around an 80 per cent chance of a reduction in the cash rate target at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members assessed that the outlook for global economic growth had been revised only marginally lower in the near term and would continue to be supported by stimulatory monetary policies and the low price of oil. They noted that growth appeared to have slowed in China and that the weakness in the Chinese property market continued to represent a significant risk both for Chinese growth and demand for construction-related commodities. Lower growth in the demand for commodities had contributed to the lower prices of Australia's key commodity exports since the beginning of the year. As a result, Australia's terms of trade were expected to decline a little more than was forecast three months ago. ", " In their discussion of the appropriate course for monetary policy, members noted the revised staff forecasts for the domestic economy. Although the recent flow of data had been generally positive, there had also been indications that future capital spending in both the mining and non-mining sectors would be weaker than expected. Overall, compared with the previous set of forecasts, growth was now expected to take longer to strengthen and the unemployment rate was likely to remain elevated for longer. This change, and generally subdued growth of domestic costs, including wages, implied that inflation was expected to be slightly lower than in earlier forecasts though still consistent with the target. On the face of it, this meant that it would be appropriate to consider an easing of monetary policy. ", " Members also discussed the potential risk that low levels of interest rates could foster imbalances in the housing market. While concerned about the very strong pace of growth of housing prices in Sydney, and observing that conditions in Melbourne were strong, members saw much more muted trends in other capital cities. As at previous meetings, they acknowledged the risks that could accompany a sustained increase in leverage from already high levels, should that occur, and that the expansionary effects of lower interest rates could be less than in the past. On the data available for this meeting, however, it did not appear that the growth of housing credit, either for investment or owner-occupancy purposes, had been increasing over recent months. The Bank would continue to work with other regulators to assess and contain the risks arising from the housing market. ", " More broadly, members noted that the low levels of interest rates were helping to support demand in the face of a number of persistent headwinds and that a further reduction in the cash rate would provide some additional support to economic activity by reinforcing recent encouraging trends in household demand. In turn, this would support non-mining business investment insofar as demand conditions were the main factor constraining these decisions. Such outcomes would be expected ultimately to lead to stronger labour market conditions. Members also noted that further depreciation of the exchange rate seemed to be both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices, and that such an outcome would help to achieve more balanced growth in the economy and assist with the transition to a lower terms of trade. ", " Members discussed the timing of any interest rate adjustment. They could see cases both for moving at this meeting or at the subsequent meeting. The latter course would bring the advantage of additional information on the economy, including details of the forthcoming Commonwealth Budget. On the other hand, with the revised staff forecasts scheduled to be released a few days after the meeting, members acknowledged that the challenges of communication might be more effectively met with a reduction in the cash rate at this meeting. ", " On balance, taking all these factors into account, the Board decided that the best course was to ease monetary policy further at this meeting. Members agreed that, as at the time of the reduction in the cash rate in February, the statement communicating the decision would not contain any guidance on the future path of monetary policy. Members did not see this as limiting the Board's scope for any action that might be appropriate at future meetings. "], "The Decision": [" The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.0 per cent, effective 6 May. "]}},

Members noted that growth in global trade was subdued, although it had picked up a little recently. They discussed the implications of the general slowdown in trade and industrial production growth, notably in Asia, including for commodity prices. In particular, iron ore prices had declined slightly over September but remained higher than earlier in the year, while oil prices had edged higher from their recent lows. Globally, core inflation had generally remained low and at rates below the targets of most central banks. ", " In China, indicators of activity for July and August had suggested further moderation in growth. Members noted that growth in fixed asset investment and industrial production had eased over 2015. This had been particularly noticeable in the north-eastern provinces of China where activity was more concentrated in heavy industry and mining. The output of key industrial products, including steel, was lower than in late 2014, partly as a result of weak residential construction activity, even though both residential property prices and sales had been higher than earlier in the year. Members observed that the services sector in China had performed more strongly than the industrial sector in recent quarters. ", " Recent data on economic activity in Japan had been mixed. Real GDP had declined in the June quarter, while conditions in the labour market had remained tight and nominal wages had continued to increase modestly. Inflation remained low, although the Bank of Japan continued to forecast that it would reach the 2 per cent target by mid 2016. Elsewhere in east Asia, below-average growth appeared to have continued into the second half of 2015 and remained a source of concern for the strength of the global economy. A slowdown in industrial production growth in the region had become increasingly apparent over recent months and exports had declined in Korea, Singapore and Taiwan in August. In India, growth in the June quarter had been driven by robust domestic demand and inflation had remained relatively low in August. ", " In contrast to the situation in much of Asia, growth in the US economy had picked up to an above-average pace in mid 2015. Recent indicators pointed to further consumption-led strength in the September quarter. Labour market conditions had improved and the unemployment rate had edged lower in August to be close to most estimates of full employment. ", " In the euro area, timely indicators suggested that the gradual recovery in the economy had continued in the second half of 2015, supported by both external and domestic demand. Unemployment had drifted lower, although the unemployment rate remained high. Inflation remained subdued. "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members began their discussion of the domestic economy by reviewing the national accounts for the June quarter, which had been released the day after the previous meeting. They noted that, as expected, GDP had increased only slightly following the strong growth recorded in the March quarter. The weakness in the June quarter had reflected temporary, weather-related disruptions to resource exports as well as the ongoing decline in mining investment. Members noted that overall growth was expected to have strengthened in the September quarter, with indications of growth in resource exports and dwelling investment. Members also observed that employment growth had strengthened despite GDP growth over the year having been at the lower end of the forecast range of a year earlier. ", " Consumption growth had been relatively steady at a below-average pace for the past year, although this was stronger than in 2013. Household income was estimated to have increased by a little less than consumption over the past year, with a modest decline in the household saving ratio. Members noted that the strength of wealth effects on consumption behaviour would affect whether the saving ratio would continue to trend down over the next year or so. While the year-ended growth in retail sales had been little changed in recent months, surveys of households' perceptions of their personal financial situation compared with a year earlier remained above average. ", " Dwelling investment had increased strongly over the year to June, despite recording a decline in the June quarter. Building approvals had declined a little from their recent peak, but remained at levels that implied further growth in dwelling investment, albeit at a gradually declining rate. Loan approvals for construction of new dwellings had also fallen over the past year. Growth in housing prices in Sydney appeared to have eased slightly in recent months and auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had declined a little from their recent peaks. However, it was too early to be confident that these signs of slowing in housing price inflation would be sustained. ", " In relation to lending for housing, members noted that the data on the split of lending to owner-occupiers and investors were of questionable quality at present. The available data suggested that there had been a modest decline in the growth of credit extended to investors in housing of late, which was consistent with the tightening in banks' lending standards in response to actions of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). With housing credit growth overall remaining steady over the past year, there had reportedly been a slight pick-up in the growth of housing credit to owner-occupiers. ", " Mining investment had continued to fall in the June quarter and now accounted for around 5 per cent of nominal GDP, down from a peak of around 8 per cent. Members noted that there had been a correspondingly significant decline in capital imports. In addition, profits of mining firms had fallen sharply over the past year, in line with lower commodity prices. Mining investment was expected to continue to fall over the next couple of years as the current pipeline of work was completed, but resource export volumes, particularly for liquefied natural gas, were expected to increase substantially over the same period. ", " Non-mining investment was estimated to have picked up a little in the June quarter and had risen modestly over the past year. Over the same period, profits of non-mining companies had kept pace with nominal GDP. Survey measures of business conditions had increased to be further above their long-run averages, notably in the household and business services sectors. Conditions in the goods production and distribution sectors, though weaker than in some other sectors, had also shown improvement of late. Members noted that the depreciation of the exchange rate had led to an increase in exports of services, including tourism, as well as a noticeable decline in imports of services. ", " Employment growth had strengthened to be 2 per cent over the year to August and the participation rate had increased. The unemployment rate had remained in its 6–6¼ per cent range over recent months. Forward-looking indicators had generally been consistent with the unemployment rate being around its current level or possibly slightly lower in the months ahead. Measures of earnings and productivity growth from the national accounts had remained soft in the June quarter, with negligible growth in either measure over the past year. Overall, unit labour costs had been little changed for around four years, which members saw as helping to explain the stronger-than-expected growth in employment. ", " Members noted that the improvement in labour demand had been concentrated in the household and business service sectors of the economy. This was consistent with the data on business conditions and output growth by industry. In contrast, employment in goods-related sectors had been little changed for some time. Members discussed the differences in the nature of the investment and employment required in the services sector relative to goods-related industries. "], "Financial Markets": [" The discussion of financial markets commenced with the observation that the two major drivers of markets over the past month continued to be concerns about Chinese growth, and the implications for the global economy, as well as the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate in the United States. ", " While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left monetary policy unchanged at its September meeting, citing concerns about global growth, a majority of FOMC members had indicated nonetheless that they still expect to start raising the federal funds rate before the end of this year. Market expectations immediately prior to the FOMC meeting implied a one-in-three chance of a rate rise occurring at the September meeting and a very high probability of a rate rise by the end of the year. Following the meeting, however, market expectations changed significantly, with an increase in the federal funds rate by the end of this year given only a 50 per cent chance of occurring and markets not fully pricing in a rate rise until April next year at the earliest. Members noted that some market participants did not expect an increase in the policy rate for the foreseeable future. ", " Bond yields in the major markets had declined in net terms over September. In the United States and Germany, 10-year government bond yields had risen in the first half of the month, mainly in response to some better-than-expected US economic data, before declining following the Fed's decision to leave the federal funds rate unchanged. Yields on Australian Government Securities had moved broadly in line with global yields over the past month. ", " The changed exchange rate arrangements in China in August had initially led to a depreciation of the renminbi, but the exchange rate had appreciated slightly over the course of September. Members noted that there had been a significant decline in Chinese foreign currency reserves since mid 2014, with apparent sizeable sales or non-reinvestment of maturities of US bonds. Following the depreciation of the renminbi in August, sales of reserves were likely to have continued in response to net private capital outflows. A significant share of private capital outflows over the past year appeared to have been in the form of increased foreign currency bank deposits. The Chinese authorities had announced that existing restrictions on private capital outflows would be more rigorously enforced. ", " Financial market conditions in a number of emerging market economies had deteriorated further in recent months, reflecting lower commodity prices and country-specific risks, especially for Brazil, Russia and Turkey, where yields on local currency denominated sovereign bonds had increased noticeably. In contrast, developments in some other emerging markets, notably India and Mexico, continued to be relatively benign. Corporate bond issuance in emerging markets in aggregate had fallen sharply in the September quarter. This had been accompanied with significant outflows from both emerging market bond and equity investment funds since the middle of the year. The currencies of some emerging market economies had depreciated further over the past month and some Asian currencies were back to the lows recorded around the time of the financial crisis in the late 1990s. ", " The US dollar was unchanged on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, while the exchange rates of most other advanced economies had been little changed. The Australian dollar had depreciated marginally to be around its recent lows against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. ", " Equity prices had fluctuated around the lower levels reached in late August in many advanced economies as well as in China, with some large daily movements in both directions. News of the Volkswagen emissions scandal in late September adversely affected European equities, while equity prices in emerging markets had partly recovered from their falls in late August, although they remained lower than at the start of the year. Australian equity prices continued to decline in September, led by the resources sector. ", " Financial market pricing indicated an expectation that the cash rate would remain unchanged at this meeting. "], "Financial Stability": [" Members were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system. ", " Global financial stability risks had been shifting from advanced country banking systems to China and other emerging market economies. Partly in reaction to this, financial market volatility had picked up following a lengthy period of low volatility and compressed risk premia. Members noted the possibility of a sharp repricing in markets where investors for years had been ‘searching for yield’. ", " Members noted that domestic sources of risk to financial stability in Australia continued to revolve mainly around developments in local property markets. In the context of recent developments in the housing market and household credit, members discussed the findings from the enhanced scrutiny of housing lending practices undertaken by APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission since the end of 2014. This scrutiny and related work had shown that investor activity was considerably higher – and lending standards in some parts of the market weaker – than had originally been thought. ", " Members further observed that the risks in commercial property and the property development sector were rising. Building approvals for new apartments remained very strong over 2015, even though rental markets appeared soft in some areas. The divergence between commercial property valuations and rents had widened further, with strong domestic and foreign investor interest for new and existing office buildings in particular, even though vacancy rates were quite high. At the same time, falling commodity prices were weighing on the profitability of many resource-related companies. The rest of the business sector seemed to be in relatively good shape, in contrast, with both gearing and failure rates at relatively low levels. ", " Members were also briefed on the risks in the New Zealand housing market and dairy sector, given the sizeable exposures of Australian banks through their New Zealand subsidiaries. ", " While Australian banks continued to perform well, they were taking steps to enhance their resilience. Banks' asset performance continued to improve, profitability remained high, and the large banks had raised substantial amounts of capital in advance of forthcoming prudential requirements. Most banks had strengthened the serviceability metrics used in their mortgage lending and taken steps to slow the pace of growth in investor lending towards the prudential regulator's expectations. Banks were also reportedly becoming increasingly wary of lending to property developers in markets that were thought to be at risk of becoming oversupplied. Nonetheless, competition among lenders had intensified in the owner-occupied segment of the housing market and had continued to do so in parts of the business lending market. Members observed that a key challenge would be to ensure that lending standards at both Australian and foreign-owned banks did not weaken from this point. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" Members noted that recent data continued to raise concerns about the outlook for economic growth in China in particular and east Asia more generally, while economic activity in the United States and euro area continued to recover. Below-average growth in the Asian region had been most evident in weak growth in industrial production, which had been mirrored in lower export volumes. While global commodity prices had fallen over the past year, they had been little changed over recent months. Global financial conditions remained very accommodative and low oil prices were expected to continue to provide a measure of support to growth in Australia's major trading partners. ", " Domestically, the moderate expansion of the economy had continued, although GDP growth in the June quarter was low, in line with expectations, reflecting what appeared to be temporary weakness in resource exports as well as further falls in mining investment. GDP growth had been below average over the past year, but there had been further evidence of rebalancing from the resources sector towards non-mining activity. This rebalancing was being increasingly supported by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, which had led to a noticeable increase in net service exports over the past year. ", " Members noted that reductions in the cash rate earlier in the year continued to provide support to aggregate demand, particularly dwelling investment and household consumption. Members also noted that conditions in the labour market had strengthened further over recent months and were somewhat better than had been expected earlier in the year. Nevertheless, spare capacity remained in the economy, domestic cost pressures were very low and inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years. ", " The key domestic sources of risk to financial stability, and stability of the Australian economy more broadly, revolved around developments in local property markets. Members noted that growth in lending for housing had been steady over recent months and that there were some signs of an easing in the strong rate of increase in dwelling prices in Sydney, in particular, although trends had been more varied in a number of other cities. At the same time, members judged that there were signs that the response of the banks to supervisory measures implemented by APRA were helping to manage risks in the housing market. Credit growth overall had been moderate. ", " Given these considerations, the Board judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate unchanged at this meeting. Information about economic and financial developments, both domestically and abroad, would continue to inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and whether the current stance of policy remained appropriate to foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

{"Date": ["Sydney – 3 November 2015"], "Text": {"Members Present": [" Glenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Heather Ridout AO, Catherine Tanna "], "Others Present": [" Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department) ", " Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary) "], "International Economic Conditions": [" Members commenced their discussion of the global economy with the observation that the recoveries in the United States and euro area economies had continued, although growth in Asia had slowed by more than had earlier been expected. This slowing was likely to be more persistent than expected and, as a result, growth in Australia's trading partners was expected to be slightly below its decade average over the period ahead. The outlook for the Asian region, particularly China, remained one of the key uncertainties in forecasting global growth. Core inflation had generally been steady in both the advanced and emerging economies at rates below central banks' targets, while monetary conditions globally were likely to be more accommodative than previously expected. ", " The slowdown in growth in Asia had been associated with lower growth in global trade volumes and industrial production, as well as further modest falls in commodity prices. Nevertheless, members noted that the outlook for Australia's terms of trade was little changed. One upside risk for commodity prices was the possibility of high-cost producers, particularly in China, cutting production in response to the already lower commodity prices. A downside risk stemmed from the possibility of weaker growth in global demand. ", " Members noted that growth in the services sector in China had held up over the year to the September quarter, but that growth in the industrial sector had declined partly owing to ongoing weakness in residential construction. Although residential property prices had increased a little in recent months, sales had retraced some of the increase seen earlier in the year. Furthermore, a substantial inventory of unsold residential property in many smaller cities suggested that it could be some time before there was a pick-up in construction activity. Members noted that the ongoing process of urbanisation would help to support demand for residential property in the longer term, notwithstanding projections of a gradual decline in the Chinese working-age population. Meanwhile, growth in exports of Chinese steel had supported domestic crude steel production despite subdued domestic steel demand. In response to moderating economic growth and disinflationary pressures apparent in producer price indices and the GDP deflator, the People's Bank of China (PBC) had eased monetary policy further. ", " Turning to other parts of Asia, the economic recovery in Japan appeared to have lost momentum around the middle of the year, although the labour market had remained tight and nominal wages had been growing moderately. To some extent, the tightness of the labour market reflected a fall in the supply of available workers associated with an ageing population. Members noted that other high-income economies in the region, including Korea, would face similar demographic challenges. Although core inflation in Japan had increased over the past couple of years, members observed that the Bank of Japan expected inflation to reach its 2 per cent target around six months later than had previously been anticipated. In the rest of east Asia, softening external demand had led to slower growth over the past year and there were signs that domestic demand had also eased in most economies in the region. India was a notable exception, where growth in domestic demand had remained strong and had been supported by a further easing in monetary policy. ", " Members noted that growth in domestic demand in the United States had been sustained, although recorded GDP growth had moderated in the September quarter following strong growth in the preceding quarter. Members observed that consumption growth had remained robust, supported by further improvement in labour market conditions. Wage growth had picked up in the September quarter, following a relatively weak outcome in June, to be around rates of recent years in year-ended terms. Members noted that the core inflation rate was steady, but below the Federal Reserve's target. ", " Recent data suggested that the euro area economy had been growing above trend and the unemployment rate continued to fall modestly, although members acknowledged that there had been considerable diversity in outcomes across countries. Core inflation for the euro area had increased over 2015, but remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). "], "Domestic Economic Conditions": [" Members observed that the Australian economy continued to grow in the September quarter as economic activity continued to shift away from mining investment to other sectors of the economy. Members noted that the forecasts for GDP growth were not materially different from those presented three months earlier. Growth was expected to be between 2–3 per cent over the year to June 2016, before rising to 2¾–3¾ per cent over the year to June 2017. The forecast for GDP growth towards the end of the forecast period had been revised down slightly to incorporate information about minor delays to the commencement of production at some large liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. ", " Members noted that recent data had indicated that consumption growth was likely to have continued at a moderate pace in the September quarter. Growth in retail sales values had been little changed in year-ended terms, survey measures of households' perceptions of their personal finances had remained above average and motor vehicle sales had risen strongly. Household consumption was forecast to contribute significantly to expenditure growth over the next couple of years, supported by low interest rates and relatively strong employment growth. The household saving ratio was still expected to decline gradually over the forecast period, as income growth was expected to pick up only slowly from recent low rates. Members noted that households' decisions about consumption and saving continued to represent an important source of uncertainty for the forecasts. ", " Overall, the low level of interest rates continued to support the housing market. Forward-looking indicators of housing activity generally pointed to further growth in dwelling investment, albeit at a moderating rate. Auction clearance rates and housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne had declined over recent months. Lending standards by banks had been tightened in response to changes in supervisory measures announced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and a number of lenders had announced increases in mortgage rates for both investors and owner-occupiers. Notwithstanding questions over the accuracy of the components of housing credit data, overall housing credit growth had increased a little over recent months, with growth in lending to investors in housing easing slightly and that for owner-occupiers apparently picking up. ", " Recent data indicated that survey measures of business conditions in the non-mining sector had remained clearly above their long-run average levels, particularly for services. Support provided to the economy following the depreciation of the exchange rate was particularly apparent in the sizeable contribution to growth from net service exports over the year to date. Growth in net service exports was expected to continue to boost growth in output over the forecast period. These developments had been accompanied by significant growth in employment in the services sector but, given that parts of that sector tend to be less capital-intensive, there had been little effect on investment from the strength of business conditions. The stock of non-residential building work yet to be done had fallen further in the June quarter but was still around its decade-average as a share of GDP, and approvals for new work remained low. Business credit growth had picked up in September after easing over most of 2015. Members noted that the ongoing improvement in domestic demand, together with the increased competitiveness from the lower exchange rate, were expected to lead to a pick-up in non-mining business investment in the second half of the forecast period. However, there remained considerable uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of this recovery. ", " Mining investment was expected to continue to decline over the forecast period, with the decline expected largely to have run its course by the end of 2017. Mining investment was expected to make the largest subtraction from demand of around 1½ percentage points in 2015/16, although the effect on GDP would be somewhat less than this after accounting for the large share of imports used in mining investment. Resource exports looked to have rebounded in the September quarter, following earlier disruptions from adverse weather and some unanticipated shutdowns of LNG facilities. LNG exports were expected to ramp up over the remainder of the forecast period, albeit with some minor delays relative to expectations in August. ", " Employment growth had been stronger than expected over 2015 and this had been accompanied by a noticeable increase in the participation rate. Employment growth had been concentrated in the household and business services sectors. Measures of job vacancies and advertisements pointed to continued growth in employment in the months ahead. The unemployment rate, after being steady at around 6–6¼ per cent for more than a year, was expected to remain around this elevated level for some time before declining gradually. Members observed that the relatively high unemployment rate and low growth of wages pointed to a degree of spare capacity in the economy. ", " The CPI data for the September quarter indicated that underlying inflation had declined to a bit above ¼ per cent in the quarter and to 2–2¼ per cent in year-ended terms. The CPI had increased by 0.1 per cent in the quarter (in seasonally adjusted terms) and by 1.5 per cent over the year. The low year-ended outcome in part reflected the earlier decline in fuel prices and a decline in utility prices in the September quarter. ", " While quarterly inflation remained subject to a degree of volatility and measurement error, the broad-based nature of the low outcome in the September quarter suggested that inflationary pressures were a bit more subdued than expected. The profile for underlying inflation had been revised down consequently. Underlying inflation was now expected to be close to 2 per cent in year-ended terms over the course of most of the next year, before picking up to around 2½ per cent in the second half of the forecast period. ", " Non-tradables inflation had declined in the September quarter, suggesting that domestic inflationary pressures were well contained and consistent with low growth in labour costs and moderate demand growth. Falls in regulated utility prices in some states had also contributed. Inflation in new dwelling costs had eased in the quarter, but had increased over the past couple of years, particularly in Sydney, in line with the continued high level of residential construction activity. ", " The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) were little changed both in the September quarter and over the past year. Members noted data showing that the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate had led to higher Australian dollar prices for imports, but that the effect of this on final consumer prices had been tempered by heightened competitive pressures, consistent with information received from liaison. Nevertheless, gradual pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation was still expected to place some upward pressure on the prices of tradable items over the next several years. "], "Financial Markets": [" Members opened their discussion of financial markets by observing that the key influence over the past month had been changing expectations about the policy settings of the major central banks. Global markets continued to be affected by large capital flows as foreign exchange reserves declined and some oil-producing sovereign wealth funds adjusted their portfolios. ", " In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left monetary policy unchanged at its October policy meeting, but indicated that an increase in the federal funds rate would be seriously considered at its December meeting, resulting in markets assigning a 50–50 chance of a rate rise occurring at that time. The ECB left policy unchanged at its October meeting, but signalled that it would be likely to announce further stimulus measures at its December meeting. The PBC further reduced its benchmark lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points, having already reduced benchmark rates by more than 125 basis points since November 2014. The PBC also reduced reserve requirement ratios by another 50 basis points, although much of the effect of this measure was to offset the drain on liquidity from recent sales of foreign currency reserves. There were also raised expectations that the Bank of Japan would ease monetary policy further in the near term. ", " Yields on US Treasuries were a little higher in net terms over October. Movements at the shorter end of government yield curves were more pronounced, including in Germany, where yields on two-year Bunds fell to a new historic low following the ECB's signal about possibly announcing new policy measures at its next meeting. Yields on longer-term Australian Government Securities had moved broadly in line with US yields. ", " The US dollar was little changed over October, with intra-month movements mainly reflecting changing expectations for monetary policy in the major jurisdictions. The depreciation of the US dollar against the euro earlier in the month had been retraced following the ECB's policy meeting and the US dollar had appreciated further against the euro following the FOMC's most recent meeting. The renminbi was unchanged against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms over the past month. The Australian dollar had also been little changed against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms over the past month. ", " The corporate bond market in the United States had seen strong issuance over much of 2015 to date, with borrowing rates at historic lows until recently, when spreads had widened. Spreads on Australian corporate bonds had also widened, particularly for resource-related companies, although borrowing costs remained relatively low for these companies overall. Australian companies generally remained conservatively geared. ", " Global equity prices had increased sharply over the past month, including following the changes in expected and actual monetary policy by the major central banks, and recovered most of their earlier falls. Australian equity prices rose but by less than the major markets, and resources sector share prices fully retraced much of their sharp falls recorded in late September. ", " The major banks in Australia continued to raise equity to meet the changes to minimum capital requirements announced by APRA around mid year, which would take effect from July 2016. Equity as a source of funding for banks had increased by around ½ percentage point to 8 per cent of total funding. The largest banks had increased standard variable housing rates in October by 15–20 basis points. Members noted that widening margins on mortgage lending were in part offsetting lower margins on lending to larger businesses, for which lending rates had continued to decline in the face of strong competition. Deposit rates had been lowered and funding costs more generally had declined. ", " Over the course of 2015 to date, Australian financial institutions had made substantial revisions to the data used to categorise housing, business and personal credit. The revisions were particularly large for the split of housing credit between owner-occupation and investment, with the share of housing credit extended to investors revised from 35 to 40 per cent. More recently, as a result of the increase in lending rates to investors in housing, a significant amount of housing lending had been reclassified from investment to owner-occupation. Further switching was expected in coming months. The revisions had resulted in discrete breaks in the level of the two components of housing credit, complicating the assessment of the rate of growth in these two components. Members noted that the stock of total lending for housing as well as its growth rate were not materially affected by the revisions. ", " At the time of the meeting, pricing in financial markets reflected around a 50–50 expectation of a reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting. "], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": [" In considering the stance of monetary policy in Australia, members noted that the global economy was expanding at a moderate pace, with some further softening in conditions in the Asian region, continuing growth in the United States and a recovery in Europe. The slowdown in Asia had been more persistent than earlier anticipated and had contributed to lower commodity prices, along with increased supply of commodities, including from Australia. The terms of trade for Australia had declined further. Monetary policy was accommodative in many economies and the low level of oil prices was expected to support growth in Australia's major trading partners over the next few years. Inflation rates remained low and below central banks' targets. ", " Members noted that recent data on economic activity in Australia suggested that the moderate economic expansion had continued. The very low level of interest rates was supporting growth in household consumption and dwelling investment. In addition, the Australian dollar was adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices and boosting demand for domestic production. This had been most evident in the services sector, which had experienced strong employment growth over the past year. While measures of non-mining investment intentions had remained subdued, surveys of business conditions had strengthened to above-average levels. These factors suggested that the prospects for an improvement in economic conditions had firmed a little over recent months. ", " Overall, the forecast for the Australian economy remained for growth to strengthen gradually over the next two years as the drag on GDP growth from falling mining investment waned and activity progressively shifted to non-mining sectors of the economy. However, members recognised that there was still evidence of spare capacity, including the relatively high unemployment rate, low wage growth and the lower-than-expected inflation outcome in the September quarter. The gradual nature of the pick-up in domestic growth suggested that spare capacity would persist for some time. Inflation was forecast to be consistent with the target over the next one to two years, but somewhat lower than earlier expected. ", " In these circumstances, members judged that monetary policy needed to be accommodative. While the recent changes to some lending rates for housing would reduce the support to demand from low interest rates slightly, overall conditions were still accommodative.
