Weighted by shares of Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports, the GDP of Australia's trading partners had increased by 4.7 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past year, which was a modest slowing from 2005. Looking ahead, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmain question analysts were focusing on was the extent to which the slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US economy would affect the world economy as a whole.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the US, the latest data suggested that growth had slowed further in recent months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the average 3½ per cent pace of recent years. The housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector remained the key to near-term prospects for overall growth. Construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity was currently forecast to fall by around 20 per cent, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould fall by more given that housing starts had now declined by 30 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the peaks at the start of the year. The consensus view was that GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould slow to around 2½ per cent, but recent data suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome downside risk to this expectation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse prices in the US appeared to have peaked and had been flat for much of 2006,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to the average of the available measures; median prices, which are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffected by compositional change, had fallen, while a repeat-sales index, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcluded compositional shifts, was beginning to level out. An important consideration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor policy-makers was how the wealth effects associated with slowing –\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor even falling – house prices would affect household spending. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail sales had softened in recent months, aggregate measures of personal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption had not slowed much so far during 2006, and had been underpinned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the strong labour market, which had supported healthy growth in incomes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in other parts of the US economy had continued to be strong. Corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofits had increased by 30 per cent over the year to the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter and represented a rising share of GDP, and business investment was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trobust.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latest data on inflation in the US indicated that the headline rate had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto 1¼ per cent, reflecting the influence of falling oil prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich has a particularly large effect on the US CPI as the small tax component\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin retail gasoline prices leads to proportionally larger changes in the latter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas oil prices change. The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad eased from just under 3 per cent to 2¾ per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was regarded by the Fed as still uncomfortably high, and the likely future\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrend in this measure would be key for the conduct of US monetary policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in Japanese GDP was solid in the September quarter, though not as high as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier in the year. The expansion was continuing, with business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing strongly, consumer confidence high and the labour market healthy. Following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevisions, the core CPI was running at about −½ per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was making the Bank of Japan cautious in considering further monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy adjustments.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, growth in industrial production had eased to around 15 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing a spike close to 20 per cent and generally higher rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof growth in the past year or two. Good growth in GDP had been recorded in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost east Asian economies in the September quarter after a soft patch around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe middle of the year. Over the past few years, China had become as important\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta destination for exports of east Asian economies as the US, but members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat China would not be immune to the effects of the slowdown in the US. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of Japanese exports to China had also risen in recent years, to be about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same as for Europe, though the US remained a more important export destination.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic growth in the euro area had continued to pick up gradually, with year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in GDP stable at around 2½ per cent in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia had recorded very strong growth over the past year or so, and GDP had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby more than 9 per cent over the year to the September quarter. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsize of the Indian economy was less than half that of China on a purchasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower parity basis, but together these two economies were steadily becoming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore important parts of the world economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe crude oil price had moved above US$60 per barrel over the past month. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen attributed to the effect of a cold snap in the US and the response by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets to production cuts proposed by OPEC.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that information received in the past few days had led to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevised estimate of GDP growth in the September quarter. The latest data for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkey partial indicators of expenditure and income suggested that quarterly output\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was now more likely to be around ½ per cent than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 per cent noted in the Board paper.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales increased solidly in October and year-ended growth had been steady at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout 6 per cent since early 2006. Annual growth in sales by large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretailers had been higher than that for small retailers for most of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the housing sector, building approvals for both houses and medium-density dwellings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell in October, though some correction from earlier increases had been likely.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApprovals in individual States were volatile and disparate trends across the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry were apparent. Vacancy rates for rental dwellings had declined further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent months and, in most capital cities, were around the low levels reached\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin previous cycles. In all, recent housing-related data were consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction activity having reached a trough, and a modest pick-up in activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year ahead was expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNationwide house prices had increased in the September quarter, according to ABS\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata, which were somewhat stronger than those recently sourced from APM. House\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had risen in all capital cities except Sydney, where they remained relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflat; prices continued to rise at an unsustainably fast pace in Perth, being\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t46 per cent higher over the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to an assessment of domestic financial conditions, with a longer perspective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was apparent that the most recent pattern, i.e. where business credit was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing more rapidly than household credit, had been the norm during most of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe 1980s. The string of corporate collapses following the boom in the late\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1980s had prompted a decade and a half of conservative balance-sheet management\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas businesses had aimed to keep gearing low. This situation was now changing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the current period of businesses gearing up could run for a while. In recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths, household credit growth had begun to slow, and this could be seen in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth the monthly credit growth and loan approvals figures, in the latter case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in approvals to investors, which were down from their peaks earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment was estimated to have fallen in the September quarter, and in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended terms and on a national accounts basis, growth was likely to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen below 5 per cent. This had followed annual growth rates of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10–20 per cent since 2002. Expectations of investment spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year ahead indicated that spending was likely to be flat, at a high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel. Business investment as a share of GDP had been trending up for the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfive years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodity prices had been stable recently, but the main feature was the extent of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rise over the past three years: measured in domestic and foreign currency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms, commodity prices had increased by 70–80 per cent since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2003. Base metals prices had increased by around 50 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the early part of 2006, and following a correction after the peak in May,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have resumed an upward trend since the middle of the year. Rural\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices were displaying the effects of the drought, with both wheat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wool prices rising sharply over the past 12–18 months. This was similar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the experience during the 2002 drought.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe current account deficit was estimated to have fallen in the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriven by a decline in the trade deficit to around ½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof GDP. However, the latest data were not seen as heralding a trend decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the current account deficit, as monthly trade data suggested the deficit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould widen again in the short term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the labour market, a correction to the run of very strong monthly employment growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame with a significant decline in estimated employment and labour force participation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin October. Year-ended employment growth remained above 2 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was still high relative to the recent pace of GDP growth. Unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell to 4.6 per cent. Business surveys indicated that labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were still tight, with small and medium businesses continuing to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treport that difficulty finding quality staff was a greater concern than a lack\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof work or sales.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe wage price index indicated that wages growth had fallen to 0.8 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the September quarter and 3.8 per cent over the year. These figures,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were lower than the recent pace of wages growth of over 4 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected the changed timing of the minimum wage increase this year. Adjusting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor this, in underlying terms wages growth had remained stable at just over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4 per cent, having increased slowly from around 3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past eight years. Broadly the same picture was evident from the data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton wage increases from enterprise agreements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe sharp fall in petrol prices in recent months was expected to subtract ¾\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpercentage point from the CPI in the December quarter. This implied that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theadline CPI rise was likely to be close to zero in the quarter; the CPI data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be released by the ABS in late January.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board was briefed on the revised inflation outlook following the latest data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton wages and taking account of the November interest rate increase. The underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate of inflation was now expected to increase a bit further in the short term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton a year-ended basis, and then drift down towards 2¾ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next two years. Headline inflation was forecast to decline sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next year and thereafter to rise to be the same as the underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDiscussion of conditions in financial markets began with some assessment of the state\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof markets globally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were four main observations. First, the world remained in a low-interest rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironment, with policy interest rates in a majority of countries still below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage. Australia was one of the few countries with its policy rate above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe average prevailing since 1993, which was the start of the current low-inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod. It was mainly the English-speaking countries that had rates above average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSecondly, the return on equity was high and the cost of debt low, and this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas providing a major impetus to the re-gearing of the corporate sector globally,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the private equity boom being one symptom of this. Thirdly, perceived\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks remained low, as indicated by default rates on debt, which were at historical\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlows, and lower volatility in financial markets. Taken together, these phenomena\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad produced a very benign environment for financial markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the regular update on current developments in financial markets, the main\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisk worrying markets at present was that the US economy would slow more than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected and that the slowing would spread to other countries. In recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had viewed this concern as greater than the risk of a resurgence of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation. Markets thought it was likely that the Fed would cut the Fed funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate in the first half of 2007, though the Fed had been trying to convey a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmessage that such expectations were premature.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 10-year bond yield in the US had fallen back to around 4.4 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past month, which was the same level prevailing a year earlier. Bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields in Europe and Japan had also fallen; in Europe, the decline in bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields had come despite expectations that the ECB would tighten monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain at its next meeting. Recent movements in bond yields indicated that markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought that the global interest rate cycle was reaching a peak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese authorities had tightened monetary policy further, mainly by raising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe required reserve ratio on banks. Interest rates had risen from the very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow level prevailing in the second half of 2005, but were still below 3 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank liquidity was high in China, reflecting the effect of foreign exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintervention by the People's Bank of China.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US share market rose early in November but declined later in the month following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release of softer than expected economic data. Overall, the market had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen relatively strong, having risen by 12 per cent over the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto date. It was still 8 per cent below its peak in 2000.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare prices had also been strong in other countries during 2006, noticeably so in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope, where the rise had been 17 per cent over the year to date.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese market had fallen slightly this year but the fall had followed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta very strong rise in 2005. Share markets in emerging markets were ending 2006\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a strong position after a mid-year shake-out. These markets had risen by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t20–25 per cent over 2006 to date, after even larger rises in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2005 as improving economic conditions had become apparent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US dollar had fallen significantly during November and early December. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainly been because of softer US economic data, though the fall had come against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe background of concerns that Asian countries might diversify reserves holdings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway from the US and towards Europe. The US dollar was close to the low point\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the euro that was reached in late 2004. The fall against the yen had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen more modest. On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar had fallen a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past month and by 7 per cent over 2006 to date, but was no\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than in late 2004. Taking a longer perspective, the broad trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindex in real terms, i.e. taking account of differences in inflation in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS and its trading partners, was currently around its average level of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast 30 years, and at least 10 per cent above the lows reached in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe early 1990s. The fall in the US dollar had resulted in the Chinese authorities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowing the renminbi to rise slightly faster against it than in the past.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, financial markets had fully anticipated the interest rate increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the November meeting of the Board, and the announcement had little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther effect. Short-term yields had not changed much since then, and current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields implied no expectation of a further tightening of monetary policy in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLonger-term interest rates in Australia had fallen, as they had in most other countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough the falls had not been as large as there was not the same concern as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US that the economy was losing momentum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian share market had been a little more volatile during November than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the previous few months, but ended the month slightly higher. Resource shares\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen in the month, reflecting concern about the possibility of a slowdown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US and the wider implications that would flow from that, but other sectors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the share market had risen further. The market overall had risen by 15 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to date, which was another strong outcome. After including dividends,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe increase for the year to date was close to 20 per cent, the fourth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsecutive year of strong returns. In fact, returns had been strong and stable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor over a decade, with only one year of negative returns in the past 12 years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis had been underpinned by the solid and consistent growth of the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand company profits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompany analysts had continued to revise up their estimates for overall profit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year ahead, though within the aggregate, estimates of profit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof resource companies had been revised down.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite the recent further rises in share prices, the current P/E ratio continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be in line with long-run averages and slightly below the average for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow-inflation period. Dividend yields had also been maintained around average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had risen further against the declining US dollar in the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, and had returned to the top of the trading range of the past three years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the Australian dollar had fallen slightly against the euro, in trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms the Australian dollar was higher over the past month.

This had been a puzzling set of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfigures, particularly when set against recent indicators of strength such as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market conditions. On the international front, recent data were suggesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat overall growth next year would be lower than the very strong 2006 outcome,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut still higher than average, even with a slowdown in the US economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, employment growth in the past few months had eased to a rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly below trend. The unemployment rate had levelled out at just over 4½ per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDevelopments in the labour market had typically been a good gauge of the business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcycle, suggesting that the economy was experiencing a slowing at present. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview of the rising inflationary pressures in recent months, some slowing was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta healthy development; the main question was about its extent. For the moment,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe best assessment was that growth was easing to a pace just below trend.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, with inflation still relatively high, the period ahead would be uncomfortable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the Federal Reserve. While the headline inflation rate was set to fall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom around 4 per cent in the months ahead following the recent sharp\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfall in oil prices, the core measure, which excluded food and energy prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad trended up in recent months. This measure was currently around 3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton an annualised basis and recent monthly rates had not shown any signs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were conscious that as the unwinding of the housing boom in the US could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave unpredictable consequences, including significant adverse effects on household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending, the high-frequency data needed to be monitored carefully in the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead. In August, housing permits and starts were around 20 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the peak six months earlier, but the extent of any further decline was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be a function of how much overbuilding had occurred in the upswing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the previous several years. Consumer spending was also being dampened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the declining or levelling out of house prices at present, but fears of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta ‘hard landing’ being driven by the housing sector were regarded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas exaggerated at this stage. Economy-wide indicators suggested that the softening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin conditions was not as sharp as for the housing sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, the Tankan survey, conducted by the Bank of Japan, indicated that business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were trending up to levels comparable to those prevailing prior\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the recessionary period. In the corporate sector, profits, which had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising since the mid to late 1990s, had been used to retire debt; in the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfew months lending to businesses had been growing for the first time in well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover a decade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in industrial production in China remained high, suggesting no change to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook for ongoing strong growth in output.

With anecdotal evidence of rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts in the coastal cities owing to rapid demand growth, prices for Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports would need careful watching.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother fast-growing part of the world economy was India, where output growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9 per cent over the year to mid 2006.

In particular, with average growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP of 9 per cent over the 10 years to 2005, China's share of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe world economy had reached over 15 per cent on a PPP basis.

Population\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrends were likely to boost the relative importance of India in the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy for some time. India's population growth rate was more than double\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat of China, and by 2030 India would overtake China in terms of population\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to official projections. Accompanying these broader trends had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta marked increase in both countries' share of Australia's exports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers expressed interest in seeing trade figures by sector for these countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were of growing importance to Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe euro area was experiencing better economic conditions than in recent years.

However, members noted that if the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy slowed more noticeably than currently expected, this could well spread\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the world economy more broadly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrude oil prices had fallen in the previous few weeks, to close to US$60 per barrel,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas tensions in the Middle East had eased further.

It was also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely that market dynamics had acted to correct part of the overshoot in prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the middle of the year.

Although the national accounts for the most recent few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarters were estimates and could be subject to significant revision, the data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad posed a number of puzzles. It was noteworthy that all three measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP had indicated a slowing in growth to around 2 per cent for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear to the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn looking at sources of growth in the June quarter and over the past year, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that consumption growth had been moderate, dwelling investment appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be levelling out and business investment had continued to grow strongly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith public demand growing above trend, this implied that growth in domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinal demand had continued to be robust. GDP growth was relatively low because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand growth had been met by a decline in inventories and ongoing rapid growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin imports. The inventories data were of low quality and prone to substantial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevision, so there was likely to be some reversal of the drag from growth from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat source in the near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast to the data on output growth, conditions in the labour market had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong during the first half of the year, with strong employment growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta further slight decline in the unemployment rate. The contrast between GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand employment trends had persisted for the past 2½ years. Employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased at an above-trend pace since the end of 2003 but during that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod GDP growth had been lower than the average for the current expansion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOther data on the labour market, e.g. for vacancies, were consistent with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength in employment, so while some element of overstatement was possible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin employment growth or hours worked, it was not likely to be significant.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe implied sharp slowdown in productivity growth appeared implausible. Despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta number of possible explanations being canvassed, members felt that the conundrum\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof relatively slow output growth and high employment growth remained. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that growth in nominal GDP had been very rapid, owing in part to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising terms of trade, and this had supported buoyant growth in government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevenues. However, it was acknowledged that the measurement errors involved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin converting nominal to real magnitudes in measuring GDP growth could be greater\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan usual at present, given the large changes in relative prices taking place.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to indicators of economic activity in the September quarter, the NAB survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof non-farm businesses suggested that business conditions had remained high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter the middle of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the household sector, conditions appeared likely to support continued moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in spending. Falling fuel prices had been a factor favouring further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, along with tax cuts and growth in wages and employment, though these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been partly offset by the effect of the recent increases in interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking all these factors into account, real household disposable income was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising at around 3 per cent, while nominal retail spending appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be rising at around 6 per cent per annum. Consumer sentiment,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of the few indicators post-dating the August rate rise, in September had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecovered about two-thirds of the sharp fall in August and was now around the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong-run average level. Households spent 11 per cent of disposable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome on debt servicing in the June quarter. The rising share of households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had an exposure to the investment property market over time had contributed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta substantial proportion of the rise in total debt-servicing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe housing construction sector was close to a trough. With approvals and commencements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trunning below trend, this implied that the growing backlog would support growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin construction activity. Moreover, vacancy rates, which were at relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow levels, had fallen further in recent quarters. Across the country, there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a large cumulative downturn in New South Wales but thus far no downturn\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Western Australia, which was the part of the country benefiting most from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe resources boom. In the period ahead, it was likely that aggregate housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity would shift from being a negative to a mildly positive influence on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the secondary housing market had been firm, though there were some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsigns of softness in the most recent data. House prices had appeared to increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup to around the middle of the year, but since then there had been some tentative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence of a stabilisation. The rapid growth in house prices in Perth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past several years was quite different from that seen in the other capitals,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere prices had been flat between the end of 2003 and the end of 2005 and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisen mildly since then. Auction clearance rates were a little lower in August,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth in Sydney and Melbourne.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousehold credit growth had increased around the middle of the year, but since then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad eased back to around 1 per cent per month. Finance approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been lower in the past two months, which suggested that the more moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth would continue in the near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment rose in the June quarter but year-ended growth eased to around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11 per cent. Further slowing in growth was likely, but the high level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof investment in the economy nonetheless implied a significant contribution\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the growth in productive capacity. Business credit growth had been rising,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto about 16 per cent per annum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the exports sector, receipts had been trending up. This had mostly reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising export prices but export volumes had increased by 1½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter. Further growth in export volumes was expected in the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor two ahead given the extent of new capacity put in place in the past few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. However, the outlook for rural exports was poor given continued dry\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions across most of the country.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodity prices had remained high in recent months.

The outlook for underlying inflation was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor it to remain close to its recent level of around 3 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis would be reviewed following the prices data to become available during\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been no changes to official interest rates in the major countries in September.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent policy rates in these countries were 5.25 per cent in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS, 3.0 per cent in the euro area and 0.25 per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJapan. Commentary from the Federal Reserve suggested that there may be a need\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor further rises in official interest rates to contain inflationary pressure,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough the markets were of the view that interest rates had peaked.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring the month, longer-term market interest rates fell noticeably in most countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMuch of this was sourced to the US, where markets considered that the weakness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the housing sector could translate to a general slowing of the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLower yields were supported by falling oil prices, which held out the prospect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof lower inflation. Yields on 10-year bonds in the US fell to 4.6 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t60 basis points lower than three months earlier. A fall of this magnitude\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not unprecedented, but the fact that bond yields were now lower than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfed funds rate was significant. On previous occasions when this had occurred\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past decade, it had been a precursor to policy easing by the Fed. It\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not clear that this was the right interpretation on this occasion as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of structural factors, in particular strong capital flows from Asia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still pushing bond yields down.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBond yields in other markets did not fall by as much as in the US.

Expectations that lower oil prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould reduce inflationary pressures were an important factor behind the market's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength, but lower bond yields may also have been supporting higher share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaluations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExchange rates had continued to be stable during September. The US dollar was little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged on a trade-weighted basis in the month, and had shown little net change\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past two years. The main development in foreign exchange markets in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months had been the weakening of the yen, despite the improving prospects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the Japanese economy. Whereas in most countries a stronger economy was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociated with a rising exchange rate, growing confidence of Japanese financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions had been encouraging them to take on more risk and increase their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment offshore, pushing the yen down. These capital outflows by institutions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave been accompanied by higher investment offshore by Japanese households,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseeking the relatively higher yields abroad.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the rate of appreciation of the renminbi exchange rate had increased.

In particular, these indicators were most striking when looked at in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of five-year averages, which indicated the persistence of drought conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLevels of stored water in non-metropolitan areas, which were important for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe viability of irrigated summer crops, had not recovered from the effects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the previous drought in 2002; the dry conditions had been exacerbated by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta noticeable rise in average temperatures in agricultural areas in recent years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdated forecasts of the reduction in supply of rural produce as a result of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrought had been provided by ABARE. The forecasts indicated a decline in farm\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP of around 20 per cent, slightly smaller than the decline in farm\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP in 2002/03 as on this occasion livestock production was expected to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless adversely affected. This would translate to a fall in overall GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof ½ of a percentage point, with flow-on and indirect effects subtracting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta further ¼ of a percentage point, though the indirect effects could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe mitigated by government subsidies and various income-support measures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe effect of the drought on the inflation outlook was quite modest in total. Past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience suggested that the net effect of drought on prices was fairly small,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas in the first instance rises in the prices of some items (e.g. cereals) were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\troughly offset by falls in prices of others (e.g. meat), and several of these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects tended to be reversed in the period following drought. More generally,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the current drought would reduce GDP primarily by reducing the economy's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply capacity, the reduction in growth associated with the drought would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot in itself do much to assist in relieving capacity constraints in the wider\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets and the Bank's Operations": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the past month, official interest rates in Europe had been increased.

The decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the real exchange rate had reflected the combined effect of the fall in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe nominal exchange rate and the decade of low inflation or deflation. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyen was pushed down as a consequence of the outflow of money from Japanese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors, who were seeking a better return than that available on domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets. The healthier real economy had given investors greater confidence to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake on the foreign exchange risk associated with investment offshore.

There had also been a sharp rise in leveraged buy-out activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past year, but the amount of money involved remained small relative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto share-market capitalisation. This pick-up, which had been driven by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse of relatively cheap debt finance to increase gearing of some companies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay have also encouraged some companies to increase their gearing in an attempt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto reduce the risk of take-over. However, following the increase, aggregate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporate gearing had only moved back towards the longer-run average, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe low levels reached in recent years. Moreover, most of the increase in gearing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been undertaken by companies that had previously been lowly geared, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe gearing of mining companies had fallen because the addition to equity capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom retained earnings had exceeded the increase in debt.

On the domestic side, though the effects of the earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in the cash rate in Australia were yet to have their full effect,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe staff forecast for underlying inflation in Australia was for it to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 3 per cent over the next two years. High levels of commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices were continuing to add to domestic incomes and spending, capacity utilisation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas at record levels and the labour market remained tight.

Nonetheless, the Board judged that the risk of inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texceeding 2–3 per cent in the medium term remained significant.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt believed that a somewhat more restrictive stance of policy, by taking some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure off demand, would improve the prospects of bringing inflation back\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards 2½ per cent in due course.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers also discussed the merits of tightening by 50 basis points, given that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on inflation of a single 25 basis point tightening was normally thought\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be modest. On balance, members decided that the smaller move would be appropriate,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor several reasons. First, the effect on inflation would reflect the accumulation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the three tightenings in 2006, and there was a degree of uncertainty as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto how well the forecasts were able to account for the earlier measures. Secondly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven that a 25 basis point increase was widely anticipated by financial markets,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta larger increase could prompt some unwelcome disruption and lead to unpredictable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects on expectations.

These purchases were expected to result in a substantial increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures of ‘base money’. In gross terms, the BoJ's purchases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould also account for around two-thirds of all new issuance of government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbonds over the coming year, with purchases exceeding new issuance for bonds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a maturity of 5−10 years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board assessed the prospect of an increase in the rate of purchases of offshore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets by Japanese residents following the recent easing in the monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the BoJ and the announcement by Japan's Government Pension Investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFund (GPIF) that it would reallocate its portfolio more towards domestic equities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand foreign assets and less towards domestic bonds.

Very low interest rates had supported activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the housing market, which in turn was expected to support consumption. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers noted that subdued labour market conditions were likely to weigh on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption growth and consumer confidence more generally. With spare capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin labour and product markets likely to weigh on domestic inflationary pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some time, the inflation outlook remained consistent with the target of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 to 3 per cent, notwithstanding some temporary upward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure from the recent depreciation of the exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the current accommodative setting of monetary policy was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto support demand and help growth strengthen at the same time as delivering\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation outcomes consistent with the target over the next two years.

While growth was still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositive in the emerging economies, it had been slowing significantly, notably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin China. Members noted that the latest IMF forecasts released during November\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad again reduced the forecast for world economic growth in 2009. The three\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor economies were now forecast to contract and growth for the world as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole had been revised down to 2.2 per cent, from 3.9 per cent forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly a few months earlier.

The labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket had continued to weaken. Housing starts were still falling and the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of starts was well below 1 million. The very low level of activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeant that the stock of unsold houses was being wound back; however, house\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices were still falling.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumer spending in the United States had fallen in real terms in each of the five\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths to October. Although real disposable income had been boosted by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpackage of tax rebates in the June quarter, this had had only a small effect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin slowing the downward trend in spending. As a result of the economic slowdown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand falls in commodity prices, US consumer prices, having reached a peak growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate of 5½ per cent on a year-ended basis, were now falling.

More recent information suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat activity had since deteriorated, but members observed that lower prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof oil and other commodities would help to cushion the slowdown.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndustrial production in China had weakened further. The current year-ended growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate of 8 per cent was similar to rates that had been typical a number\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof years ago, but well down from the 15–20 per cent pace seen over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast five years.

The volume\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof retail sales increased only slightly in the September quarter, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo quarters of small declines. According to data that were released during\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe meeting, retail sales rose by 0.7 per cent in October. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe more reliably measured sales of large retailers increased only slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin October and the staff's liaison with retailers suggested that conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay have weakened further in the past month or so. Members observed that retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales were considerably weaker in New South Wales than in the rest of Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand this was seen in other economic indicators also. Another indicator of household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption was motor vehicle sales. These had fallen considerably over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast year. Consumer sentiment had remained relatively low in November. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere updated on developments in household net worth, which had fallen by 11\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent over the past year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the housing sector, the data on housing loan approvals and housing credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had picked up a little in the past two months after slowing sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the first half of the year. But activity in the sector remained subdued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBuilding approvals data suggested that residential construction was trending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown, though the current level of activity was already running well below estimates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof underlying demand for housing. In the established housing market, conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere also subdued. However, there were some indications that house prices were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevelling out after falling in the September quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that business investment was estimated to have been broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflat in the September quarter, but had expanded by about 10 per cent over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast year. Looking forward, year-ahead investment intentions of businesses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor 2008/09, reported in the ABS capital expenditure survey, were about 20\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent higher in nominal terms than they had been this time last year for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2007/08, though there had been some scaling back of investment plans recently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers thought the surprising strength of investment expectations partly reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe very long-term nature of many large investment projects. However, they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that private-sector surveys had suggested a more pronounced scaling back\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof investment intentions in the past few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness debt funding had picked up a little over recent months after slowing in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first half of the year.

At present, current borrowing was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainly intermediated finance. Broadly consistent with the credit data, commercial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloan approvals now appeared to be levelling out, after having fallen earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndications from business surveys were that business conditions had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoften over recent months, and business confidence had fallen to a very low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel, which was not surprising given the financial market disruption in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers then turned to an assessment of recent developments in commodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOil prices had been falling since July and were now below US$50 per barrel\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Tapis crude; they had fallen by 20 per cent over the past month. The oil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice had also fallen markedly in Australian dollar terms. Spot prices for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbulk commodity exports were trading well below the latest contract prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough members noted there had been little sales activity in the spot markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom a longer-run perspective, bulk commodity prices were still running ahead\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof levels of a few years earlier. Weaker commodities demand, particularly from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina, was also starting to affect resource export volumes, particularly for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiron ore. In this environment, freight rates had fallen very rapidly, more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan unwinding the rise over the past two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn reviewing conditions in the labour market, members noted that employment had held\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup well in the past few months, and the unemployment rate had been relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteady. However, the trend in employment growth was slowing. Indicators of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfuture growth in employment were weakening more sharply; the number of jobs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvertised on the internet and in newspapers was falling and business surveys\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated lower hiring intentions.

This movement, which was reflected in a similar pattern\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the measure of inflation expectations derived from the bond market, was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to have been influenced by movements in oil and other commodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe December quarter CPI outcome was expected to be held down noticeably by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fall in global oil prices, with retail petrol prices expected to subtract\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround ¾ percentage point; the March quarter CPI would also be reduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif current petrol prices were sustained.

The latest IMF and private-sector forecasts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere suggesting that growth in both the developed and emerging economies in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2009 would be significantly lower than thought only a few months earlier.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent actions by a number of governments and central banks to stabilise their respective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial systems were beginning to take effect, but financial market sentiment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained fragile and evidence of weak economic conditions in the major economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a significant slowing in many emerging economies was still accumulating.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the Australian economy had been more resilient than other industrial economies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent data indicated that a significant moderation in demand and activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been occurring.

Given these circumstances and the associated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing in capacity pressures, there would be downward pressure on inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia over the year ahead. Global disinflationary forces were likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto assist in this regard, though members acknowledged that the depreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the exchange rate meant the decline of inflation to the target could take\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger than would otherwise have been the case.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers agreed that it was appropriate to shift the monetary policy setting from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits current roughly neutral position to one that was clearly expansionary.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board saw a need for the reduction in the cash rate, and bank lending rates,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be large enough to have a noticeable effect on financing decisions of lenders\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand borrowers. Members also took account of the fact that a Board meeting was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot typically scheduled in January, given that local markets tended to be relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthin over the summer break and statistical and survey data, as well as liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation, were less timely.

The moderate slowdown in aggregate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth over the past two years had been driven by developments in the housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. The latest data showed that non-housing parts of the US economy had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained strong, with exports in particular now rising strongly, assisted by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe depreciation of the US dollar.

It would be difficult\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the period ahead for the rest of the US economy to remain as strong as it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been, since the housing downturn would feed back into employment and incomes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, therefore, spending.

Most data indicated continued strong expansion in demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia, with continuing pressure on capacity.

But compared with the actual and expected cash\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate, short-term borrowing costs had still risen noticeably since the November\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting. To date, lenders had largely confined the pass-through of these increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts to business borrowers, though household borrowers could, in time, face\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome additional increase as well. These developments could be expected to exert\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan additional degree of restraint on demand, over and above that caused by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe increases in the cash rate since mid year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers indicated that, absent the changes in market yields since the November meeting,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere would have been a strong case on domestic grounds for a rise in the cash\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate at this meeting. But given that a rise in money market rates had occurred,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers observed that a further rise in the cash rate at this meeting, by adding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto these market pressures, would result in quite a significant tightening of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverall financial conditions over a short period.

Alternatively, it could be that pass-through from the lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate was occurring more quickly than usual, or that pass-through of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower growth in wages was occurring more slowly than usual. It was also possible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there was less spare capacity, enabling retailers or wholesalers to increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir margins.

Non-tradables inflation (abstracting from increases in administered prices)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso increased in the quarter. Some of this was due to higher inflation in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing costs, with the cost of new dwellings rising as housing construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up. Members noted that the increase in non-tradables inflation was somewhat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat odds with the soft growth in labour costs associated with the weak labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the labour market, members noted that the unemployment rate had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto edge higher in recent months, to 5.8 per cent in December, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the participation rate had dipped further and had declined noticeably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince mid 2013. Members were informed that the ageing of the population accounted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor around half of the decline in the participation rate over the past few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears.

Consumer sentiment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad recorded a modest decline around the end of 2013, but it remained a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove average. While weak conditions in the labour market had weighed on consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, the increase in housing and equity prices over the past year raised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe possibility that consumption growth could outpace that of income in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the effects of low interest rates were clearly evident in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe housing market, where prices had increased further and turnover had picked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup to be just below average. These conditions were expected to provide further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport to new dwelling activity over the period ahead, and leading indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof dwelling investment had increased. Members observed that the softness in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommercial construction meant that there was labour available to support the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong growth of higher-density dwelling construction.

Market expectations were for the purchases to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphased out by the end of the year. The Fed had again stressed that the policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate would be likely to be kept at zero for a considerable period.

The ECB's balance sheet had continued to shrink, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprepayment of lending under the ECB's earlier three-year longer-term refinancing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toperations.

That was also the case in Australia, where the share market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad generally underperformed most of the major markets over the course of 2013,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising by 15 per cent.

Nonetheless, during January some country-specific risk factors, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan environment of generally decreased investor appetite for emerging market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposure, had seen financial markets in some emerging markets come under pressure.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome central banks had responded to the pressures on their exchange rates by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\traising interest rates, though members also noted that some other countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been less affected in the current episode than had been the case in mid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2013.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, periods of pressure had persisted in the money market, with the People's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of China at times not responding with as large an injection of liquidity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas in the past when money market rates increased.

After a positive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treaction to the European Union summit in late October, financial market sentiment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeteriorated through most of November, reflecting the difficulty European policymakers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere having in dealing with the debt crisis, as well as political instability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin several euro-area countries. Sentiment improved again late in the month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, following the co-ordinated announcement by the major central banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a reduction in the access price for the US dollar swap lines.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe deterioration in sentiment in the early part of the month saw yields on sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt of most euro-area countries rise sharply, particularly in the case of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly and Spain, but the rises were reversed late in the month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that European banks would be required to achieve core capital ratios\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 9 per cent by mid 2012. It had become evident that, rather than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\traise new equity capital, a number of banks were seeking to increase their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital ratios by selling assets, particularly assets outside the euro area,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand by scaling back trade finance. This risked dampening economic activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe strains in European interbank markets also intensified in November, with an increasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of banks effectively shut off from new funding and having to rely instead\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the European Central Bank (ECB). Some banks also appeared to be running\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshort of the collateral necessary to obtain funding from the ECB and were undertaking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollateral swaps with non-bank institutions or turning to their national central\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbank.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile wholesale debt markets globally appeared to be closed to many financial institutions,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-financial corporations were still able to raise debt.

As a result,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing and business lending rates were around their post-1996 average. Looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward, market expectations were for another reduction in the cash rate at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe December meeting, with further reductions anticipated by the middle of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe coming year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn other countries, the People's Bank of China had changed its policy direction,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlowering banks’ reserve requirement ratios by 50 basis points, after having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased it considerably over the past year. Brazil had also reduced its policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate target by 50 basis points.

Consumer and business confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued to fall. The unemployment rate had been rising gradually over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past six months.

They also noted that if these problems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere occurring in a single country with its own currency, they could be addressed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough some combination of exchange rate depreciation and looser monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy, but these options were not available to individual members of a currency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunion. It remained very difficult to judge how events would ultimately play\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout in Europe. On the one hand, if recent efforts were successful in moving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards a solution, confidence should improve. On the other hand, a much worse\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutcome was possible, involving a severe contraction in the European economy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich would have global effects notwithstanding the capacity of the authorities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Asia to apply more stimulatory policies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast to developments in Europe, recent data in the United States had shown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta more positive tone than was the case around the middle of the year.

Consumer confidence had improved a little, although it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained low. There had been a gradual improvement in the labour market, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in private-sector employment more than offsetting ongoing falls in public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment, and the unemployment rate had fallen recently. The Federal Reserve's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatest forecasts were for growth of 2½ per cent or a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher in 2012.

The poor outcomes in Europe were weighing on Asian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports, and growth in domestic demand had moderated somewhat. In China, most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the monthly indicators, including for industrial production and retail sales,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still consistent with solid GDP growth. However, conditions in the housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket were noticeably weaker than over the past couple of years, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effect of controls on buyers and tight credit supply for developers. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that this slowing was in line with the authorities’ intentions. The slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin private housing construction was being offset by growth in construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof social housing, but production of crude steel had fallen somewhat in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese economy expanded by 1.5 per cent in the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas consumption and exports picked up after the natural and nuclear disasters\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin March. In contrast, Thailand had been severely affected by flooding, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta large decline in industrial production in October.

Growth in output, however, was expected to be less than that of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand because of the high import intensity of much of the current investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the appreciation of the exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast to the strong capital expenditure data, the value of private non-residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals had remained at a fairly low level over recent months.

Wage growth in the public sector over 2013 was around its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowest pace since 2000, consistent with ongoing fiscal restraint. Business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurveys indicated that wage growth in the March quarter was likely to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued, which was consistent with liaison reports that firms were having little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty finding suitable labour.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unemployment rate had increased to 6 per cent in January, continuing its gradual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease of the past 18 months, while the participation rate had declined significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the middle of the previous year, largely because of a decrease in male\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipation. The level of employment was little changed over the past year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough total hours worked had increased. Members noted the recent high-profile\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannouncements of future job losses against the backdrop of the 400,000 to 450,000\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who leave employment each month and the similar number who take up employment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey discussed the potential for the extensive coverage of these job losses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadversely to affect consumer confidence. At the same time, there was evidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat forward-looking indicators of labour demand had stabilised, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier declines to low levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in household spending looked to have picked up slightly in the December quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough the pace of growth was expected to remain a little below average for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta time. Liaison suggested that the stronger retail sales seen in the latter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths of last year had continued into the early part of this year, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales growth may have eased somewhat.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that conditions in the established housing market had remained strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing price inflation had declined somewhat from the fast pace recorded in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2013, although the data were less informative around this time of year owing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto relatively low turnover. Ongoing strength in the established housing market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand low lending rates were expected to support new dwelling activity. Dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was expected to record a slight decline in the December quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut a strong increase in approvals for residential buildings over recent months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– both for higher-density and detached dwellings – pointed to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstantial increase in dwelling investment in subsequent quarters. Loan approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand first home buyer grants for new dwellings had also increased of late. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that construction firms were optimistic about the outlook and had reported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta pick-up in enquiries from prospective new home buyers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey measures of business conditions had edged higher in January and remained at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove-average levels.

Mining investment was estimated to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave declined in the December quarter, as expected, and non-mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained subdued. In the first reading for 2014/15, the ABS capital expenditure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata suggested that a small improvement was in prospect for non-mining business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment. Members noted that the ABS capital expenditure survey reported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat mining investment was expected to decline sharply in 2014/15, which had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready been embodied in the Bank's forecasts for some time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe December quarter national accounts were scheduled to be released the day after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe March Board meeting.

Members noted, however, that some emerging market economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained under pressure, while developments in Ukraine over recent days had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweighed on general market confidence. In Russia, equities had fallen sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the rouble had depreciated, prompting an emergency rate increase and currency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintervention by its central bank.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSovereign bond yields in the major economies had shown little change through most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof February, until late in the month when the situation in Ukraine led to falls\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin global bond yields.

At this rate, asset purchases would end late\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2014. The first increase in the federal funds rate was not expected until\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2015. The European Central Bank also reiterated its expectation that its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy rate would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced an expansion in its bank lending schemes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latter would provide little direct additional stimulus but nevertheless\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temphasised that the BoJ remained committed to providing additional stimulus,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif required, to meet its 2 per cent inflation target in 2015.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, liquidity conditions in money markets had eased throughout February, after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets reopened following the week-long Chinese New Year holiday.

Credit growth across the advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies remained slow, in contrast to emerging Asia, where financial conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained quite buoyant, although carrying a different set of risks. Market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns about vulnerabilities in some emerging markets had returned in late\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary, but largely focused on country-specific issues rather than representing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan across-the-board retreat from risk-taking. Members noted that the prospect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof direct financial contagion from emerging markets to advanced economies was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlimited, because major banking systems had little exposure to these markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ongoing fragilities in the euro area meant, however, that some spillovers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould occur if investor sentiment were to deteriorate more broadly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian banking system continued to perform strongly and remained well capitalised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBanks' asset performance had improved further.

While these factors were helping\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto support residential building activity, they also had the potential to encourage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeculative activity in the housing market. Lending to housing investors had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen increasing for some time in New South Wales, and over the past six months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit had also picked up in some other states. While such a pick-up would be unhelpful\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif it was a result of lenders materially relaxing their lending standards,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent evidence indicated that there was little sign of this occurring. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the recent momentum in households' risk appetite and borrowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbehaviour warranted close observation, but agreed that present conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe household sector did not pose a near-term risk to the financial system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the experience in other countries where macroprudential tools\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been utilised to slow demand for established housing and their possible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapplication in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe demand for credit by businesses remained soft but this sector was no longer deleveraging.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndicators of distress in the business sector continued to decline, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe amount of non-performing loans related to commercial property.

The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttargets for inflation and money growth in China were also unchanged for 2014.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data for the United States were consistent with further moderate growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy, even though adverse winter weather conditions had had a noticeable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemporary effect on activity in the March quarter in at least some parts of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe country. Indications were that consumption and business investment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to rise in recent months, and the increase in payrolls employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin February was close to the average pace over 2013.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, domestic demand growth had remained strong, with activity picking up prior\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the consumption tax increase at the beginning of April.

The spot price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor iron ore had been volatile over recent weeks, while steel prices in China\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined and spot prices for coking and thermal coal were well below current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontract levels. The fall in the price of steel in China over recent weeks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas consistent with a softening in demand. At the same time, the supply of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteel appeared to have been constrained by a tightening in credit conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting the Chinese authorities' concerns about pollution.

Business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment fell in the December quarter, driven by a large decline in machinery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand equipment investment and falls in engineering and non-residential building\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction. While much of the decline appeared to have been driven by mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment, non-mining business investment was also estimated to have declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the quarter. More recently, non-residential building approvals had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin January and, in trend terms, were at their highest level since 2008, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases evident across a range of categories, including the office, industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ‘other commercial’ sectors.

The latest data on ownership of Australian debt showed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat foreign holdings of Commonwealth Government Securities were around two-thirds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the total, compared with around one-third for state government debt.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit markets were generally quiet over the month with corporate bond issuance in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloped markets continuing at a similar pace to that in recent years, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuance in emerging markets had declined over the past year, mainly reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless issuance by Chinese non-financial corporations. Credit risk in the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporate bond market had received more attention from investors and commentators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month after authorities allowed the first default in the onshore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese market to occur. In Australia, corporate bond spreads remained around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir lowest levels since 2007/08 and issuance continued to be easily absorbed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the market, including issuance by lower-rated corporations and at longer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaturities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity markets were little changed over the month, and the Australian equity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket moved broadly in line with developments elsewhere.

The policy rate was now expected to remain below 0.50 per cent for more than three years. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the ECB had indicated that it would continue preparatory work to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenable it to undertake outright purchases of asset-backed securities if required.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ECB had also reaffirmed its commitment to further unconventional policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures – including large-scale, broad-based asset purchases –\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif the latest measures failed to boost inflation towards the 2 per cent target.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers contrasted these measures with the actions taken by the US Federal Reserve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat its June meeting, when it again reduced its asset purchases by a further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS$10 billion to US$35 billion per month, down from a peak of US$85 billion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper month in 2013. The Fed remained on track to cease asset purchases later\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis year, with markets expecting the first increase in the federal funds rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the middle of next year. Members also noted that the Reserve Bank of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNew Zealand had raised its policy interest rate for the third time in the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcycle in response to a strengthening economy, while market expectations of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first increase in the Bank of England's policy rate had shifted forward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the end of this year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn response to generally better-than-expected economic data, government bond yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States had increased a little in June, largely reversing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in the previous month. In contrast, yields on German bonds had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards their historic lows during June.

The recent improvement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin growth was driven by a rebound in exports and a pick-up in investment growth,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich partly reflected the effect of modest stimulus measures. Conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese residential property markets had weakened further, particularly in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe larger cities, as many local government restrictions on property transactions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplemented prior to 2014 remained in place.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, temporary fiscal stimulus measures had been introduced to counter the contractionary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects of the consumption tax increase, but the underlying pace of growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained uncertain.

The decline in non-tradables inflation since 2013 was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost evident in lower growth of prices for market services. This was consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the slowing in growth of labour costs, which reflected both lower wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and higher productivity growth. Meanwhile, inflation in the cost of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew dwellings had increased over the past 18 months or so, reflecting increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand for residential construction.

Forward-looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of labour demand had generally improved, but pointed to only modest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth in the near term. A notable degree of spare capacity in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market was suggested by the relatively high unemployment rate and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipation rate being close to its lowest rate in almost a decade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to household consumption, members noted that the volume of retail sales declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter, in part reflecting the unusually warm weather at the start\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof winter.

While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential building approvals had declined in trend terms since early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014, the stock of work yet to be done was expected to support the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of non-residential construction in coming quarters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe volume of exports was estimated to have declined in the June quarter, after increasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly in the preceding quarter as a result of strong growth in resource\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports. The growth of iron ore and coal exports had been expected to moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the rapid pace seen in recent years, as capacity was forecast to expand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a slower rate over coming quarters. While construction of large projects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto expand LNG capacity was proceeding, production was not expected to begin\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing noticeably until 2015.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that staff forecasts for domestic GDP growth were not materially different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom those presented three months earlier.

Growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin non-mining activity had been expected to increase a little further, having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready picked up over the past year, partly as a result of the support provided\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the very low level of interest rates. Resource exports were forecast to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadd substantially to growth over the next few years. However, mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to decline more rapidly than it had to date, and ongoing fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsolidation and the effects of the still high level of the exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere expected to restrain growth. Members considered the implications for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts of the usual assumptions that the cash rate and the exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained at their current levels and noted that the no-change assumption for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate was consistent with market expectations over the near term.

Working in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other direction, the decline in the exchange rate since early 2013 had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpushed up import prices and these higher prices ‘across the docks’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere being passed through to prices facing consumers.

Overall, prospects for growth remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunclear, even though labour market conditions had been relatively tight, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage labour earnings having increased a little over the past year.

The decline over the past year had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected a combination of increased Australian and global supply and, more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently, some softening in the growth of Chinese demand for steel, perhaps\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresulting in part from weaker conditions in the housing market. Members observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat most Australian iron ore production remained profitable at these lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices and that increased pressures on global higher-cost mines would be expected,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin time, to lead to reductions in their production.

Members noted that a decline in resource\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports in the June quarter had followed very strong growth in the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo quarters, which meant that resource exports had made a significant contribution\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto year-ended growth. Consumption recorded moderate growth in the first half\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2014. Over the year to June 2014, consumption had grown faster than real\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisposable income, resulting in a further decline in the savings ratio.

Measures of business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions and confidence had remained around, or a little above, their long-run\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverages.

They also noted that the recent labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce data had been quite volatile, suggesting the possibility of some measurement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproblems. The unemployment rate in August had retraced the sharp rise recorded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin July to be close to 6 per cent, around the average of the monthly unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate over the year to date. Employment had reportedly increased substantially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin August, driven by an exceptionally strong rise in part-time employment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at a broader range of data, members concluded that labour market conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained subdued, although they appeared to have stabilised somewhat over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse of 2014 to date.

While no explicit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget was set, the ECB's intention appears to be to expand its balance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheet back to its crisis peak, which would be around 1 trillion euros larger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan at present, through a combination of targeted long-term refinancing operations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(TLTROs) and asset purchases.

While an appreciation of the US dollar had been anticipated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some time, the exact timing of the appreciation was difficult to explain.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe appreciation was associated with an increase in volatility in the main\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrency pairs, albeit only back towards typical levels. The euro had depreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby 9 per cent since early May to be at its lowest level against the US dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin two years, while emerging market currencies had generally depreciated against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US dollar as well. The notable exception was the Chinese renminbi (RMB),\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been little changed against the US dollar and had appreciated in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade-weighted terms by 5 per cent over the preceding year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated by 4 per cent in trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms over September.

The recent depreciation followed a period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the Australian dollar had held up against the US dollar more than most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother currencies, and meant that the Australian dollar was now around its January\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow against the US dollar but remained a little higher on a trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis than earlier in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that US sovereign bond yields had fluctuated over September, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGerman, UK and Australian bond yields generally tracking the moves in US yields.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare prices in the developed economies had declined over the past month, with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texception of Japan, where share prices had risen strongly in conjunction with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta sizeable depreciation of the yen.

Members noted that more timely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures of conditions had generally picked up a little, but it was too early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto judge the likely pace of growth over the second half of this year. The economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof east Asia overall had been growing at around the rate of recent years, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe United States had recorded a strong rebound in growth in the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast, economic activity in Europe remained weak, with real GDP in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro area unchanged in the June quarter and the unemployment rate falling only\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually.

Overall, conditions remained subdued. The recorded unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate increased to 6.4 per cent in July. This was concerning, though members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that interpretation of this increase had been clouded by significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasurement issues and that other labour market indicators suggested conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not deteriorated to the extent implied by the increase in the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate. While employment growth had moderated somewhat in recent months, employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained about 1 per cent higher over the past year and forward-looking indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof labour demand had been improving modestly since late last year. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that forecasts of a period of below-trend growth in economic activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeant that it would be some time before the unemployment rate declined consistently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the degree of spare capacity in the labour market was apparent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the slow growth of wages. The wage price index for the June quarter indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat annual wage growth had remained around the slowest pace seen in the 17-year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistory of the series. Business surveys and information from liaison with firms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that wage growth in the private sector was likely to remain contained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat around its recent pace over coming quarters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the June quarter national accounts were scheduled to be released\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe day after the meeting.

Domestic demand was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to have been supported by further growth in dwelling investment and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderate consumption growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA number of indicators – including retail sales and measures of consumer confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– suggested that household consumption had increased moderately in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter.

At the same time, a wide range of indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed that conditions in the established housing market continued to strengthen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn particular, housing prices had been rising at a rapid pace and auction clearance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates were above average levels.

In contrast, credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand property prices had been growing strongly in some emerging economies, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina until recently, which had made these economies more sensitive to adverse\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshocks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that Australian banks continued to report improving asset performance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand strong profits, which had contributed to further increases in their capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratios. Australian banks and non-banks had both benefited from easier wholesale\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunding conditions globally. This in turn had encouraged stronger competition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin lending for housing and to large businesses, but members noted that this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not, to date, led to a general easing in mortgage lending standards and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicies. For investors in housing, the pick-up in housing credit growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen more pronounced than for owner-occupiers, with investor demand particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers further observed that additional speculative demand could amplify the property\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice cycle and increase the potential for property prices to fall later. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmain risks in such a scenario would likely be to the stability of the macroeconomy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than the financial system, particularly if households were to react\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto declines in their wealth by cutting back on their spending.

On the other hand, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven the declines in key commodity prices and, overall, had offered less assistance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto date than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccommodative monetary policy was supporting demand in some sectors of the economy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut policy also needed to be cognisant of the risks to future growth that could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccompany a large further build-up in asset prices, particularly if that was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociated with an increase in leverage.

While growth in housing credit for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers was only a little above that of income, credit extended to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors had continued to grow at a noticeably faster rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the strength in the housing market was expected to give some support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto household consumption in the near term as rising housing valuations allowed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome credit-constrained home owners to bring forward their consumption. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in retail sales in the September quarter and stronger growth in retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales in those states with more rapid housing price growth was consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis view. However, members also observed that expectations of low income growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be likely to weigh somewhat on consumption, which was expected to continue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing at a moderate pace in the near term before strengthening over 2016.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey measures of business confidence and conditions, along with measures of capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutilisation, had been close to or above average long-run levels.

Notwithstanding a substantial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpipeline of non-residential building work yet to be done, non-residential building\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprovals had declined over the past year.

While acknowledging that the removal of the price on carbon\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been an important factor behind lower CPI inflation in the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers noted that the effect on underlying inflation, which had declined to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t½ per cent in the quarter and 2½ per cent over the past year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas much smaller.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the fall recorded in tradables inflation in the September quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a little surprising, given that it had been increasing in year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms over the previous year, reflecting the depreciation of the exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the preceding 18 months or so. But they also noted that tradables\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation was quite volatile on a quarterly basis and that some of the most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent fall could be attributed to discounting of clothing and footwear prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto clear winter stocks built up during the period of unusually warm winter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweather. Non-tradables inflation over the past year remained below its average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent years and was little changed from the June quarter, abstracting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the effect of the repeal of the carbon price on utility prices.

At the same time, Japan's Government Pension\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestment Fund (GPIF) announced a reduction in its target allocation for domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbonds, together with significant increases in the corresponding target allocations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto domestic and foreign equities and foreign bonds.

Despite a rise in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfull-time employment in October, all of the growth in employment over 2016 had been in part-time employment, with an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased share of people in the labour force reporting that they would like to work more hours. Members discussed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious measures of labour underutilisation, including those that account for the number of hours sought by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployed and the additional hours desired by those who are underemployed (and who are also recorded as actively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsearching for additional hours).

Although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential building approvals had declined sharply in October, the significant amount of work in the pipeline \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that the level of dwelling investment activity would remain high.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the contribution of dwelling investment to growth was expected to decline over the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, conditions in the established housing market had strengthened over recent months.

However, inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained below most central banks' targets and monetary policies had continued to be accommodative.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic activity in China had continued to be supported by accommodative financial conditions and public spending,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly on infrastructure. However, high and rising levels of debt remained a risk to the outlook over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger term. Members observed that measures had been introduced to dampen housing price inflation in a number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcities and that this posed an additional risk that growth in housing market activity might be lower in the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tahead. Producer prices had increased over the preceding year, following declines over several years, and measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumer price inflation had edged higher.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, GDP growth had been around estimates of potential over the past year. While business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had been weak, consumption growth had continued to be supported by strong labour market outcomes.

There was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty about the policy agenda of the incoming administration. A range of estimates suggested that the plans\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor fiscal policy could provide a boost to economic activity over the next few years and place some upward pressure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton inflation. Working in the other direction, however, if policies were enacted to restrict trade, there could be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant adverse effects on the economic outlook in the United States and beyond.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic activity in the euro area had continued to recover. Members noted that some economies in the euro area were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfacing larger structural challenges than others. In Italy, the level of GDP remained lower than it had been prior to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe global financial crisis, non-performing loans had remained at a high level and gross public debt was around 135 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcent of GDP. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market conditions had continued to tighten in most advanced economies. In the United States, this had led to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta modest pick-up in nominal wage growth, but unit labour costs had been rising at an above-average rate. Growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twages and unit labour costs had also been above average in Japan. In the United States, core inflation had been only\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta little below the Federal Reserve's goal during 2016, while core inflation in Japan had moderated over the course\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the year to date and inflation expectations had remained relatively low. In the euro area, inflation had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than the target of the European Central Bank, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstabilised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that there had been some large market movements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the outcome of the US Presidential election, but that movements had been generally orderly and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in volatility had been short-lived.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUS Treasury yields had risen sharply following the outcome of the US Presidential election, reflecting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassessment in financial markets that the Trump administration's policies overall were likely to boost growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation, although there was considerable uncertainty around this. Sovereign bond yields had also increased in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother major economies, though by less than in the United States. Members observed that the increase in US Treasury\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyields, while large, was not as large as some other movements in recent decades and yields remained very low by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thistorical standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the policy rate unchanged at its November meeting.

The sectoral pattern of movements across US stocks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treflected the expected effects of the Trump administration's policies as well as higher oil prices. In Japan, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the yen and better-than-expected growth had contributed to a rise in share prices.

The depreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar was particularly marked. Several emerging market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral banks had intervened in the foreign exchange market. The US dollar had also appreciated against most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economy currencies.

Over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecent years the Board had sought to balance the benefits of lower interest rates in supporting growth and achieving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inflation target with the potential risks to household balance sheets.

They noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the labour market had improved while GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlooked to have continued growing at a below-average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpace over 2015. The unemployment rate declined to 5.8 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent in December, employment grew at an above-average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate over 2015 and the participation rate was on an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupward trend. The national accounts for the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, released the day after the previous meeting,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that GDP growth had picked up as expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the September quarter, partly because net exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad rebounded following weather-related disruptions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter. More recent data on activity and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade suggested that output growth had eased in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter and remained below-average in year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there had been further evidence of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity rebalancing away from the resources sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards non-resource sectors. Output growth in the services\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, particularly household services, had been strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe relatively labour-intensive nature of this growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that compositional change may help to reconcile\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta rise in employment growth to an above-average rate,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the one hand, and output growth remaining below average,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the other. Also, low growth in labour costs was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have contributed to an improvement in Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinternational competitiveness and encouraged businesses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto employ more labour than otherwise.

Growth was expected to be similar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the December quarter, based on recent retail sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata, indications from the Bank's retail liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat trading conditions had improved in the Christmas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand post-Christmas sales period, and surveys suggesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat perceptions of households' own finances remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove average. Household consumption growth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by low interest rates, lower petrol prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand increasing employment, despite relatively subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold income growth.

As a result, the saving ratio\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained close to 10 per cent over the past five\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears, which was a significant step up from its average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the previous two decades but not particularly high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom a longer-run perspective.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment had increased strongly over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear to the September quarter and further growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipated, albeit at a gradually declining rate. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas consistent with building approvals, which were at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta high level, although lower than in early 2015. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that some other indicators of dwelling investment,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding loan approvals for new construction, had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore positive in recent months. Information from liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontacts indicated that demand for high-density housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had been sufficient\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto absorb the increase in the supply that had come onto\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe market, whereas demand had been somewhat weaker\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Perth, which had experienced a decline in prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand rents for apartments over the past year. To date,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had not been any substantive signs of financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistress from developers, but there had been an increasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of projects put on hold, particularly in areas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere there were concerns about potential oversupply.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the established housing market more generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad eased in recent months. Housing prices had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little from September 2015 and auction clearance rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen from very high levels to around their long-run\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing credit growth overall had stabilised at around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7½ per cent, following a period of rising growth since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2012. Growth in credit to investors in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined, offset by an increase in growth in credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto owner-occupiers. This was consistent with the larger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in mortgage rates for investors and the strengthening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof banks' non-price lending terms in response\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto earlier supervisory actions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs expected, mining investment had fallen sharply in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe September quarter and further large falls were anticipated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the largest subtraction from GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth from falling mining investment (net of imports)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to occur in 2015/16. Resource export volumes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued to rise over 2015 as more projects reached\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletion. Iron ore exports, particularly to China,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained at a high level and were expected to continue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto make a positive contribution to GDP growth over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast period. The ramp-up in LNG exports was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto gain pace over the course of 2016, although some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects had experienced delays in bringing production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton line. The scope for additional growth in coal exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared limited, given the low level of coal prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, net service exports had risen further in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponse to the earlier depreciation of the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate and were expected to continue supporting GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe forecast for Australia's terms of trade had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen revised down a little as a result of lower commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices over recent months. Members recognised that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook for commodity prices and the domestic terms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof trade would depend on the outlook for the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction and industrial sectors – and global industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity more generally – and on the responsiveness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the supply of commodities to the decline in prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseen to date. Oil prices had fallen markedly over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths in response to further increases in supply, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker demand was likely to have had some effect as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell. Current low oil prices were having a marked effect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton capital investment across the industry, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin countries with high production costs.

They observed that demographic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanges and strong productivity growth had been key\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrivers of economic growth in China for some time, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese forces were now reversing and were likely to weigh\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton future growth as a result. In particular, China's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been supported by an increase in the size\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the working-age population and the migration of many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagricultural workers to urban areas, where they had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen more productive. The working-age population had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted to fall but the urban workforce was still growing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of continued urbanisation.

Structural\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treform was also important for the future trajectory\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof productivity growth, which had slowed over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina's economic development had been characterised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby very strong investment growth, which had been funded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a significant extent by high saving rates in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold sector. An element of the policy response\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the global financial crisis had been to increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe credit available to the non-financial corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand government sectors, which had led to sizeable increases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the debt held by these sectors. Slowing aggregate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and excess capacity in some industries had raised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe risk that some firms would find it more difficult\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto make repayments on their debt, which could, at some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint, be associated with more widespread financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproblems.

Growth in household consumption and dwelling investment had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong in the quarter, while net exports had been little changed and business investment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubtracted from growth. Including upward revisions for the September quarter meant that GDP had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrown by 3.0 per cent over 2015, which was stronger than forecast in February. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that this outcome was broadly consistent with the improvement in the labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved over 2015. More recent data had suggested that the Australian economy had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrow at a moderate pace in early 2016 and that activity had continued to rebalance towards the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining sectors of the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that growth in household consumption had picked up in the second half of 2015,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by low interest rates and strong employment growth and despite further subdued growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin household income. The household saving ratio had been on a gradual downward trend over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious few years. While retail sales growth had recorded little change in February, liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad reported that trading conditions remained generally favourable and surveys of households'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperceptions of their own finances remained above average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment, particularly in the high-density sector, had risen strongly in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Although residential dwelling approvals had declined over the past year or so, a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsizeable pipeline of work yet to be done was expected to support dwelling investment in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod ahead. Conditions in the established housing market had moderated over the past six\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths, with aggregate measures of year-ended housing price growth continuing to ease. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the easing in growth in apartment prices was consistent with the recent strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in supply and that there continued to be significant differences in demand conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross the country; conditions had been relatively strong in the detached housing markets of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSydney and Melbourne and relatively weak in Perth. Housing credit growth had moderated a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent months to be close to 7 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms, after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising through to mid 2015.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe decline in business investment in the December quarter had been broadly in line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations. Mining investment had fallen to around 4 per cent of nominal GDP from a peak\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 8 per cent in 2012. Members noted that the recent rebound in commodity prices, even if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustained, was unlikely to lead to any material change in mining investment over the next couple\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof years. The December quarter national accounts also indicated that non-mining business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had been little changed for several years. Nevertheless, surveys of business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had remained above average in recent months, consistent with the slight increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining profits (as a share of GDP) recorded in the national accounts, and business credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued to show strength, growing at over 8 per cent in six-month annualised terms in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary. Members noted that employment growth in non-mining sectors of the economy had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively strong and that there was evidence that non-mining business investment had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the previous financial year in New South Wales and Victoria. Non-mining investment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen sharply in Western Australia, which suggested that the decline in commodity prices and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmining investment had been adversely affecting non-mining business conditions and investment in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat state.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoth export and import volumes had increased modestly in the December quarter. Over the year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresource exports had been increasing as projects were completed and production capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased. Much of this growth had been driven by liquefied natural gas projects and members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that this was likely to remain the case over the next couple of years. Growth in net\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice exports, which was consistent with the pronounced increase in short-term visitor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrivals, had contributed around ½ percentage point to growth over 2015. Members observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this component of GDP was one of the most sensitive to changes in the exchange rate and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the impact of exchange rate movements on the economy more broadly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFollowing stronger-than-expected outcomes in the latter part of 2015, the level of employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been little changed over the three months to February. In the month of February, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipation rate had declined a little and the unemployment rate had fallen back to 5.8 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent. Members observed that month-to-month volatility in the labour force data was not unusual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that, overall, the labour market was noticeably stronger than a year earlier: employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had remained a little above average, the unemployment rate had been on a downward trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince around mid 2015 and the participation rate had been on an upward trend. Leading indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof employment growth had been mixed of late; job advertisements had levelled out in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths after a period of relatively consistent increases, while job vacancies reported by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses had continued to increase.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour cost pressures had remained subdued across a range of measures. The most recent data on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenterprise agreements and the national accounts measure of average earnings per hour had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed the low growth of wages that was already apparent in the wage price index. Nominal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunit labour costs had been unchanged for over four years, as growth in employee earnings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad broadly matched growth in labour productivity. Members noted that subdued labour cost growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad led to low household income growth, but had also enabled businesses to increase employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby more than might have been the case otherwise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndicators of global economic activity had eased a little over recent months, but were still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with growth in Australia's major trading partners remaining at a slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow-average pace in the March quarter. Survey indicators had suggested that activity in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice sectors in a range of economies had moderated since late 2015 and that conditions in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanufacturing sector globally had remained subdued in early 2016. Global industrial production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand trade volumes had been little changed over the past year. Members observed that these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures had been particularly weak for the Asian region. Meanwhile, growth in several advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies had led to a further decline in unemployment rates over that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the pace of overall growth in the first two months of the year appeared to have been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly unchanged from the end of 2015, although the data were affected by the timing of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese New Year holiday period. While growth in industrial production had been relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstable, there had been a large decline in the production of crude steel and steel products.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNonetheless, imports of iron ore (including from Australia) had remained at a high level,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the lower level of Chinese iron ore production following declines over 2015. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth target for 2016 had been lowered at the recent meeting of the National People's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCongress to 6.5–7 per cent from ‘around 7 per cent’ in 2015. There\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been acknowledgement that achieving this target would require some additional support from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal and financial policy. Members noted that the pick-up in growth in total social financing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin China since the first half of 2015 was consistent with the authorities' willingness to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport growth in economic activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExpectations of more policy stimulus in China in the near term appeared to have contributed to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in iron ore and steel prices, both of which have risen substantially from their lows\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the turn of the year. Members noted that this would imply a modest near-term rise in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia's terms of trade, should current levels of commodity prices be sustained. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the same time, Chinese steel production had declined further and the global supply of iron\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tore was expected to increase as new mines ramped up production during 2016.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough inflation in most advanced economies had increased since reaching a low point in 2015,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation rates had remained below central bank targets. In Japan, despite relatively tight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market conditions, wage growth was expected to decline a little in the year ahead based\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the outcome of recent wage negotiations between unions and large employers. Ongoing weakness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin output growth and lower oil prices had led the Bank of Japan to revise down its forecast for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theadline inflation in 2016 and push out the point at which inflation is expected to reach the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget. Although the euro area economy appeared to have experienced further modest growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch quarter and the labour market had continued to improve, inflation remained little changed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent months at rates below the European Central Bank's (ECB) target. ECB staff had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdowngraded their forecasts for GDP growth and inflation, noting weakening global growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(particularly among emerging market economies) and the appreciation of the euro, and did not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpect inflation to return to the target until after 2018.

In particular, the share of high loan-to-valuation lending had taken a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticeable step down and tighter serviceability metrics had reduced maximum loan sizes. Housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket conditions had also moderated. These developments had generally enhanced resilience in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe household sector, but could cause issues for developers of some apartment projects if demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor their product were to slow significantly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome other commercial property markets had also been adjusting with a lag to a slowing in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand.

In the rest of the business sector, the balance sheets of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome resource-related companies had come under strain following the large falls in global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices over recent years.

Profitability had remained high. Banks' non-performing loans remained low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverall; while they had picked up for resources-related lending, banks' exposures to this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector and mining services firms were small, although some foreign banks operating in Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad much higher exposure shares. Members nonetheless observed that as banks competed for lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a narrower range of markets, it would be important that serviceability and other lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards remained appropriate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that there had been some easing in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe growth of global economic activity, particularly in emerging markets, although growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral advanced economies had led to a further decline in unemployment rates over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear.

They noted that inflation had been lower than expected. Various\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures suggested that underlying inflation had declined to a little less than ¼ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcent, compared with about ½ per cent in the December quarter, to be about 1½\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent over the year. Headline inflation had been lower still, partly reflecting a decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin fuel prices in the March quarter and over the year. Even so, the CPI data had indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat weakness in domestic cost pressures had been broadly based. Non-tradables inflation had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined further in March to around its lowest year-ended rate since the late 1990s,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting low growth in labour costs and a range of other factors, including heightened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretail competition, a moderation in conditions in housing rental and construction markets,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand declines in the cost of business inputs such as fuel and utilities. The exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation over the preceding few years had continued to place some upward pressure on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprices of tradable items, although low wage growth and heightened retail competition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have limited the extent to which higher import prices had become evident in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretail prices. The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed in the March quarter.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the extent to which the CPI data provided a signal about ongoing inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrends. They noted that CPI data were less subject to measurement error than many other key\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata series. Moreover, the lower-than-expected CPI outcome could not be explained entirely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby temporary factors and in fact was significantly driven by low price rises for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-tradable items. That in turn was consistent with a range of data suggesting quite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued growth in labour costs (which had also been a bit weaker over 2015 than previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected).</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn their consideration of the outlook, members noted that the staff forecasts for inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been lowered. The forecasts embodied the expectation that growth in the wage price index\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould stabilise around current quarterly growth rates before gradually picking up later in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forecast period. This pick-up was consistent with the outlook for output growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected improvements in labour market conditions. In addition, information from the Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness liaison suggested that firms generally had been unwilling to make offers of wage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth below 2 per cent. But if inflation was to be persistently lower than previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast, it was possible that, in time, this could be reflected in lower wage growth.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that wage growth had also been low in many advanced economies, even in cases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere labour market conditions had become quite tight. This suggested that some of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfactors that might explain these outcomes, such as heightened job insecurity, may be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelevant to the current Australian experience. On the other hand, given the apparent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflexibility of the Australian labour market over recent years, members noted the possibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat labour cost growth could pick up sooner or by more than expected as labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions improved.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth had slowed in the first quarter of 2016, although members noted that it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained stronger than population growth over the past year. Leading indicators of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployment had been somewhat mixed: job vacancies reported by businesses had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trise, while job advertisements had been broadly flat over recent months. These indicators,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talong with the outlook for output growth, suggested that employment would continue to grow,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut at a somewhat slower pace than had been evident over the previous year. The unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trate had been around 5¾ per cent in recent months and was expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround this level over the next year or so before gradually declining over the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, as output growth increased. The outlook for the unemployment rate was broadly in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tline with the forecasts presented three months earlier and consistent with spare capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining in the labour market throughout the forecast period.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there had been no material change to the forecasts for growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian economy, although the unexpected strength recorded in the latter part of 2015 had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tled to an upward revision to year-ended GDP growth in the near term. The effects of low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates and the depreciation of the exchange rate since early 2013 were expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlead to a gradual strengthening of growth to an above-trend rate and help a further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trebalancing of activity towards the non-resources sectors of the economy.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in household consumption had increased in the second half of 2015. While the pace of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in retail sales volumes looked to have been maintained early in 2016, other timely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of consumption had eased a little in recent months. Information from the Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tliaison with retailers suggested some moderation in trading conditions in 2016, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had remained generally positive. Households' perceptions of their own finances\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined to around average levels in April, after being above average for most of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpast year or so. However, these indicators provided only a rough guide to quarterly growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin consumption, which was forecast to be slightly above average even though real household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisposable income had been revised lower, consistent with revisions to wage growth. As a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresult, the household saving ratio was expected to continue to decline gradually.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe amount of residential construction work still in the pipeline was substantial and had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased further of late. This pointed to further strong growth in dwelling investment,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talbeit at a gradually declining rate consistent with the decline in building approvals over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe previous year. Conditions in established housing markets had stabilised over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsix months or so. Housing prices had grown moderately over 2016, following a small decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat the end of 2015. Housing credit growth had eased a little to around 7 per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsix-month-ended annualised terms in early 2016. This had followed increases in mortgage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trates and the strengthening of banks' non-price lending terms in response to supervisory\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tactions.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSurveyed conditions in the business sector had remained above average and growth in business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit had increased over the past year or so. Indicators of investment intentions remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweak; for instance, the stock of private non-residential work yet to be done had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther in the December quarter, in line with subdued levels of non-residential building\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapprovals. This suggested that non-mining business investment was likely to remain subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a time, although it was forecast gradually to pick up later in the forecast period as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toverall demand strengthened further. Mining investment was expected to continue to fall as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects were progressively completed, although the magnitude of the falls was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiminish over the next couple of years, consistent with the forecasts presented in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>.

The contribution of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnet service exports to growth was expected to continue to be positive given the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trate depreciation since 2013.</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>Recent data indicated that growth in Australia's major trading partners had eased around the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tturn of the year to be somewhat below its decade average in the early part of 2016. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook for growth in major trading partners in 2016 and 2017 had been revised a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlower since the February <em>Statement</em> <em>on Monetary Policy </em>to reflect these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata as well as some reassessment of the momentum of growth, particularly in Asia. Growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor trading partners was expected to be supported by accommodative monetary policies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhile fiscal policies were expected to be less of a drag on growth in the major advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. Core inflation had increased in many advanced economies since mid 2015, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers noted that inflation had remained low globally and was lower than central banks'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttargets in most economies.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in the Chinese economy had moderated further in the March quarter. Subdued investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the manufacturing sector had been offset to some extent by rising public infrastructure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment and renewed growth in real estate investment. The latter was consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength in the Chinese residential property market following earlier government measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdesigned to stimulate demand. Chinese trade volumes had declined further, which had had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflow-on effects to other Asian economies and emerging economies in other regions with strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade links to China. There had been some indications that slowing employment growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh-income economies of east Asia might lead to a slowing in consumption growth in these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe outlook for the Chinese economy had continued to be a key issue. Despite the moderation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin growth in the March quarter, the outlook there was similar to that forecast previously,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbased on the expectation of further support being provided from more stimulatory policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsettings. The Chinese authorities appeared, at present, to be giving greater priority to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshort-term growth objectives over longer-term goals of deleveraging and encouraging growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was less reliant on investment and heavy industry. However, members noted that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuit of near-term growth targets was likely to increase the already elevated levels of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt and could delay addressing the problem of excess capacity in the manufacturing and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresources sectors. Therefore, these actions might adversely affect financial stability and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economic outlook in China more broadly in the medium term.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe available data suggested that growth in the United States had eased in the first\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, partly owing to weakness in private investment in the oil sector. Other components\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof US domestic demand had been more resilient, supported by very expansionary monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy, strong employment growth and increasing household wealth. In contrast, Japanese GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas likely to have remained little changed in the March quarter. The euro area economy had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to grow at an above-trend pace, driven by domestic demand.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough labour markets had shown further improvement across most advanced economies, wage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had thus far remained subdued. There had been signs of labour cost pressures building\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand core inflation increasing in the United States and the United Kingdom, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rates were close to levels typically associated with a pick-up in inflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures. But wage growth had moderated in Japan, despite the unemployment rate being\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround a 20-year low. Members noted that there was significant uncertainty about the timing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand extent of the pick-up in wage growth and inflation that could be expected as labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets tightened further in the advanced economies. Any changes in expectations about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflationary pressures would have implications for the expected path of monetary policy and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequently exchange rates, which continued to be an important source of uncertainty in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite the moderation in major trading partner growth in early 2016, members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had been a further sizeable increase in commodity prices, particularly for iron ore,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcoking coal and oil. The rise in the prices of bulk commodities had followed the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tannouncement of China's 2016 target for output growth and an expectation that this would be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tachieved through more stimulatory policy settings. The price of iron ore had increased by 80\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent from its low point at the end of 2015, but was still only around one-third of its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpeak level five years earlier. The forecasts assumed that these higher prices of bulk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodities would not be sustained. Demand for steel in China was still expected to decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next couple of years and a substantial amount of new, low-cost iron ore supply was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to enter the market over that period. The price of oil had increased by around 70 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcent since recent lows and this had occurred alongside ongoing speculation about potential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcaps to OPEC production and signs that oil production in the United States was likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline. This had led to an upward revision to LNG prices. The net result of these various\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmovements was that Australia's terms of trade would be slightly higher than previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected in the near term and were assumed to remain close to recent levels – which were 35\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent below the recent peak – over the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that sentiment had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto improve.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at monetary policy settings of the major central banks, members noted that the Bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Japan had not changed policy at its meeting in the preceding week, notwithstanding market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations that policy would be eased further.

The CPI increased by 0.6 per cent (in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseasonally adjusted terms), after falling a little in the March quarter, to be 1.0 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigher over the year. Measures of underlying inflation had picked up to ½ per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe June quarter, to be around 1½ per cent over the year. Increases in the prices of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatile items, namely fuel, fruit and vegetables, made some contribution to headline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation in the quarter, but the increase in inflation was broadly based. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the latest inflation data had been in line with the forecasts in the May <em>Statement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton Monetary Policy</em>.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe most recent data on prices and labour costs confirmed that domestic cost pressures had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen subdued. This reflected a number of factors associated with low wage growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures on costs and margins, which had resulted in the lowest year-ended rate of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-tradables inflation since the late 1990s. Heightened retail competition in recent years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding from new foreign entrants, had limited increases in goods prices. Rent inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained at low levels and members observed that this was likely to persist for some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime given the large pipeline of new construction. In contrast, growth in prices of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadministered items and the cost of constructing new dwellings had increased in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Meanwhile, the prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined in the June quarter and were little changed over the year. Although the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the exchange rate over the past few years had exerted upward pressure on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timport prices, this had been largely offset by subdued domestic costs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there was little change in the forecast for underlying inflation. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral forecast was still for inflation to remain around 1½ per cent over 2016 before\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing to between 1½ and 2½ per cent by the end of the forecast period. The substantial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the exchange rate over recent years was expected to exert some upward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure on inflation for a time and inflation expectations were assumed to return to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger-run average levels. The forecast increase in underlying inflation also reflected the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpectation that strengthening labour market conditions would lead to a gradual rise in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in labour costs. In particular, members noted that growth in average earnings had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen low given the spare capacity in the labour market. Moreover, growth in average earnings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been affected by lower wage outcomes in sectors related to the mining industry as a part\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the process of adjusting to the lower terms of trade and the end of the mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboom. Both of these effects were expected to wane over the forecast period. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there continued to be considerable uncertainty about momentum in the domestic labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket and the extent to which domestic inflationary pressures would rise over the next few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unemployment rate had remained at around 5¾ per cent over recent months. Following a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery strong outcome over 2015, employment growth had moderated over the first half of 2016;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been concentrated in part-time employment, although full-time employment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased noticeably in June. Forward-looking labour market indicators had been mixed but,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton balance, pointed to employment growth consistent with the unemployment rate remaining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround its current level over the coming months. Over the forecast period, though, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate was expected to decline slightly to be closer to 5½ per cent, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that there would be ongoing spare capacity in the labour market. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat liquefied natural gas (LNG) production, which is less labour intensive than other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindustries, was likely to make a significant contribution to output growth in the coming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. This suggested that the past relationship between growth in GDP and employment might\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe less useful as a guide for forecasting labour market conditions over the coming few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReal GDP growth appeared to have moderated in the June quarter, following the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger-than-expected outcome in the March quarter, when unusually favourable weather\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had boosted resource export volumes. Members noted that there had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchange to the outlook for GDP growth, which was expected to be around 2½–3½ per cent over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016 before rising to around 3–4 per cent by 2018 (above estimates of potential growth).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis outlook reflected the effects of low interest rates and the depreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate since early 2013, which were supporting the rebalancing of economic activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards non-resource sectors of the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at the components of the forecast for output growth in more detail, members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat household consumption growth was expected to remain close to its long-run average over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next couple of years. Surveys suggested that households' perceptions of their own finances had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to be above average, despite relatively weak income growth, and that consumers'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment expectations had fallen in recent years. Members observed that household income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was forecast to rise gradually to around its average rate, consistent with a gradual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in wage and employment growth. These forecasts implied a further slight decline in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe household saving ratio, but there was some uncertainty about whether households would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trespond to developments affecting their disposable incomes by adjusting consumption growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor altering their saving rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment was expected to increase further, having grown strongly in recent years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talthough the contribution to output growth was expected to diminish over the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod. Building approvals had declined over the preceding year, but remained at high levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand had exceeded the amount of work completed. As a result, the number of dwellings under\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction had increased to very high levels. Further, members noted that the pipeline of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential construction work, which included work that had not yet commenced, had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe risk of oversupply in parts of the country. The outlook for the balance of supply and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand in the housing market was important for the inflation outlook because housing costs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmake up a significant share of the CPI basket.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the established housing market, members noted that most indicators pointed to an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teasing in conditions since late 2015. Recent data indicated that housing prices appeared to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave grown modestly in the June quarter and had declined a little in most capital cities in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJuly. Data on housing price growth from CoreLogic, which had been discussed at previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeetings, indicated that housing prices had increased very strongly in several cities in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApril and May. However, new information had revealed that these growth rates were overstated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of changes to CoreLogic's methodology; data from other sources indicated that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousing price growth had instead remained moderate in the June quarter. Other information\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed that, while auction clearance rates had recently picked up a little in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne, the number of auctions was lower than in the preceding year and the average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of days that properties were on the market had increased. Housing credit growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen little changed in recent months and remained below that of a year earlier. Rent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation had declined to its lowest level since the mid 1990s and the rental vacancy rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad drifted higher to be close to its long-run average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNet exports were expected to make a positive contribution to output growth over the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, supported by the earlier exchange rate depreciation and ramp-up in LNG production.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast, mining investment was expected to fall further, although the effect of this on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutput growth was expected to diminish over the next year or so. While there had been some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsigns that non-mining business investment was rising in some parts of the economy, overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit was expected to remain subdued in the near term. The pipeline of non-residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction had remained at a low level and non-residential building approvals had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed over recent years. Looking ahead, indicators of business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions had continued to point to subdued non-mining business investment in the next year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor so, although survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticeably above their long-run averages.

Despite this, commodity prices had picked up since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning of the year, partly because of reductions in supply by some high-cost producers of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodities, including iron ore and coal.

A substantial slowing in demand in the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproperty market would pose risks for property developers and related industries, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe steel industry. There was also uncertainty related to how the Chinese authorities would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trespond to the difficult trade-off involved in supporting growth and avoiding financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisruption in the near term, while achieving more financial discipline and broader reforms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover the longer term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth in the major advanced economies had been around or above estimates of potential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, supported by expansionary monetary policies and less-contractionary fiscal policies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted, however, that potential growth was lower in most advanced economies than it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been prior to the global financial crisis. Combined with low inflation, this implied low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in nominal incomes, which potentially created challenges for agents in the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had nominal obligations, such as debtors and pension funds, particularly if they had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassumed that growth would continue at higher rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market conditions in most advanced economies had continued to improve, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation remained below most central banks' targets.

Growth in economic activity in Japan was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremain around its current low rates, supported by the recently announced additional fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulus package. In the United States, the unemployment rate had fallen to around, or even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow, estimates of its long-run equilibrium and there was some evidence of an increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twage growth. Inflation had also increased in the United States since mid 2015 but, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended terms, had remained a little below the Federal Reserve's inflation goal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the unemployment rate had continued to decline in the euro area, considerable spare\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity remained and inflation had continued to be lower than the European Central Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had stabilised following the volatility surrounding the UK referendum in late June.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice movements during the past month had been driven by US economic data and expectations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof further monetary policy stimulus in Japan and Europe.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn late July, the Bank of Japan announced further stimulatory policy measures and that a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomprehensive review of policy would be undertaken ahead of its next meeting in September.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs had been expected by market participants, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US federal funds rate unchanged following its July meeting. Market expectations of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlength of time before the FOMC would raise the federal funds rate again fell after the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelease of strong US employment data, but since then had risen in response to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker-than-expected US GDP data. Members noted that another rate rise in the United States\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas not priced in by markets until late 2017. Market pricing indicated that the European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCentral Bank was expected to ease monetary policy at its meeting in September in response to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns that the uncertainty following the UK referendum might weaken the economic outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the euro area. The Bank of England had indicated that it expected to ease policy at its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting in coming days.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSovereign bond yields declined to record lows in early July and subsequent movements were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely in response to the flow of US economic data and expectations of Japanese policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulus. Yields remained materially below levels at the start of the year, most notably in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe United Kingdom. Japanese government bond yields increased by 10 basis points after the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of Japan announced its recent stimulus measures. Members observed that Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields had moved broadly in line with global developments, to reach a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thistorical low. The downward revision to Standard &amp; Poor's outlook for Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsovereign credit rating had no impact.

They noted that the cost of borrowing US dollars in exchange for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teuros and yen in short-term foreign exchange swap markets had increased over 2016 to date,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas had spreads on short-term bank funding in US dollars. These developments appeared to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treflected increased demand from Japanese investors and banks, as well as impending reforms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto US money market funds. The Bank of Japan's latest policy announcement included a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfacility to enhance access to US dollar swap lines, which reduced the cost of borrowing US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdollars in exchange for yen. In Australia, the spread of 3-month bank bill rates to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tovernight indexed swap rates had declined relative to levels earlier in the year, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained higher than during 2015.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare price indices in the major markets had increased over the past month, with the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshare market reaching a new high.

Low interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trates and the depreciation of the Australian dollar since 2013 were expected to continue to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport the necessary adjustments in the economy following the end of the mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboom, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn coming to their policy decision, members noted that the recent CPI data had confirmed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat inflation was likely to remain low for some time. They also observed that while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprospects for growth were positive, there was room for stronger growth, which could be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassisted by lower interest rates. At the same time, members noted that indicators for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\testablished housing market in the first half of 2016 had pointed to an easing in conditions,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding lower housing credit growth and an easing in housing price pressures.

Fiscal and monetary policy settings remained highly\n\t\t\t\t\texpansionary and in some economies additional fiscal stimulus was in prospect. Growth forecasts for the\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal economy and Australia's major trading partners had been revised a little higher as a\n\t\t\t\t\tresult. However, the brighter outlook did not change members' assessment that the global recovery\n\t\t\t\t\twas still likely to be bumpy and uneven, with most economies expected to be well short of their\n\t\t\t\t\tpre-pandemic trajectories at the end of the forecast period. Labour markets were therefore likely to\n\t\t\t\t\thave considerable spare capacity for some time, resulting in subdued inflationary pressures. The spread\n\t\t\t\t\tof the virus and the speed of vaccine distribution remained key determinants of the outlook.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the global recovery had lost some momentum around the turn of the year as\n\t\t\t\t\trestrictions on mobility in some economies were tightened following a resurgence of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> infections. This continued a pattern observed in the preceding year of\n\t\t\t\t\thighly variable growth outcomes across economies. China and some other economies in east Asia had\n\t\t\t\t\texperienced relatively strong recoveries, with GDP in the current year likely to be tracking at levels\n\t\t\t\t\texpected before the pandemic. Favourable health outcomes and a surge in manufactured goods exports had\n\t\t\t\t\tcontributed to this. Many economies were expected to have recovered their pre-pandemic levels of GDP by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe end of the year, but still be short of levels expected prior to the onset of the pandemic. In a\n\t\t\t\t\tsmaller number of economies, including some in Europe that had experienced severe health outcomes, GDP\n\t\t\t\t\twas expected to still be below pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2021.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the strength of the global demand for goods, the faster-than-expected recovery in\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal economic activity and the improved outlook had contributed to a strong rebound in commodity and\n\t\t\t\t\tother key input prices. Oil prices had recovered much of their decline early in the pandemic, while\n\t\t\t\t\tbase metals prices were above pre-pandemic levels. Iron ore prices had also risen further in recent\n\t\t\t\t\tmonths, to trade at their highest levels in many years. High iron ore prices had been supported by\n\t\t\t\t\tongoing supply disruptions in Brazil and strong demand from Chinese steel producers. The higher\n\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices had supported a marked rise in Australia's terms of trade, which was expected to\n\t\t\t\t\treach its highest level in nearly a decade in the March quarter. Members also noted that other\n\t\t\t\t\timportant global input prices, such as those for semiconductors, had risen above levels prevailing\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore the pandemic, reflecting strong global demand for electronics and other goods that use\n\t\t\t\t\tsemiconductors as inputs.</p>", "<p>Members noted that several vaccines had already been approved for use internationally, and that more\n\t\t\t\t\twere likely to be available in the near future. Some countries, including those with well-functioning\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic health systems and ample initial vaccine supplies, had been able to meet or exceed their early\n\t\t\t\t\ttargets for the rollout of their vaccine programs, while other countries had fallen short of their\n\t\t\t\t\ttargets. Distributing and administering vaccines on such a large scale and under intense time pressure\n\t\t\t\t\twas presenting significant logistical and administrative challenges for many countries.</p>", "<p>In concluding their discussion of the international economy, members discussed the significant fiscal\n\t\t\t\tresponses to the pandemic. Additional fiscal support had been announced in a number of economies that\n\t\t\t\twere affected by second or third waves of infections. The wide variation in public debt levels prior to\n\t\t\t\tthe pandemic, and in health outcomes over the preceding year, helped to explain some of the\n\t\t\t\tcross-country differences in fiscal responses.</p>"], "Domestic economic developments": ["<p>Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that the recovery in the second half of 2020 had been\n\t\t\t\t\tfaster than initially expected, in line with the pattern observed internationally. Favourable health\n\t\t\t\t\toutcomes in Australia had enabled the lifting of restrictions and boosted activity. Consumption had\n\t\t\t\t\trebounded quickly as health-related restrictions on activity had been eased, suggesting that\n\t\t\t\t\tsupply-side constraints were key to driving the spending patterns observed during the pandemic;\n\t\t\t\t\thouseholds had also adapted their consumption habits. Business investment had fallen, but by less than\n\t\t\t\t\texpected. More broadly, the rapid bounce-back in domestic activity had also been supported by\n\t\t\t\t\tadditional fiscal measures announced by the Australian and state governments in the latter part of\n\t\t\t\t\t2020. This had enabled a faster recovery in labour market conditions than expected a few months\n\t\t\t\t\tearlier, with the unemployment rate in the December quarter declining more quickly than even the upside\n\t\t\t\t\tscenario presented in the November 2020 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.</p>", "<p>In discussing the outlook for activity and the labour market, members noted that the forecasts under\n\t\t\t\tthe baseline scenario had been upgraded relative to 3 months earlier. This upward revision\n\t\t\t\tincorporated the stronger starting point for the forecasts and improved outlook. GDP and employment were\n\t\t\t\tnow expected to reach their pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2021, around 6–12 months\n\t\t\t\tearlier than previously expected.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the lowest rate of population growth since the First World War would continue to\n\t\t\t\thave a significant bearing on the outlook. The level of GDP was not expected to return to its previous\n\t\t\t\ttrajectory over the forecast period, largely because population growth would be so much lower than\n\t\t\t\tassumed prior to the pandemic. Lower population growth would continue to weigh on both aggregate demand\n\t\t\t\tand labour supply in the period ahead, although the effects on labour supply and wages would be partly\n\t\t\t\tlimited by foreign students tending to have a lower participation rate than the domestic working-age\n\t\t\t\tpopulation. Low population growth, reflecting reduced net overseas migration in particular, was also\n\t\t\t\texpected to affect high-density residential investment for some time to come. Members noted that overall\n\t\t\t\tdwelling investment would have been lower had the HomeBuilder program and other state government\n\t\t\t\tincentives been less effective in stimulating activity in the detached housing sector.</p>", "<p>In their discussion of the labour market, members observed that, in contrast to expectations\n\t\t\t\t3 months earlier, the peak in the unemployment rate had probably already occurred. Notwithstanding\n\t\t\t\ta swift rebound in the participation rate, the firmer outlook for employment had resulted in a lower\n\t\t\t\texpected unemployment rate profile across the forecast period. Despite the end of the JobKeeper program\n\t\t\t\tin March creating some uncertainty for near-term labour market outcomes, the unemployment rate was\n\t\t\t\texpected to resume trending lower in the second half of the year. In the baseline scenario, the\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate was expected to decline to around 6 per cent by the end of 2021, before\n\t\t\t\treaching around 5¼ per cent by mid 2023. While the strong recovery and improved\n\t\t\t\toutlook for employment had reduced the prospects for substantial scarring effects in the labour market,\n\t\t\t\tthe forecasts implied that there would still be spare capacity in the labour market at the end of the\n\t\t\t\tforecast period.</p>", "<p>Members commenced their discussion of the household sector by noting that the rebound in consumption in\n\t\t\t\tthe second half of 2020 had been supported by very strong growth in disposable income over the year. As\n\t\t\t\ttemporary income support measures tapered or ceased, household income was expected to decline through to\n\t\t\t\tthe middle of 2021, before resuming steady growth in line with recovery in the labour market. In the\n\t\t\t\tbaseline scenario, consumption growth was expected to remain positive but moderate in the period ahead;\n\t\t\t\tin per capita terms, the level of consumption had rebounded strongly and, by 2022, was forecast to have\n\t\t\t\treturned to levels expected prior to the pandemic. The outlook for consumption was supported by many\n\t\t\t\thouseholds strengthening their balance sheet and liquidity positions during the pandemic. Restrictions\n\t\t\t\ton consumption, precautionary behaviour and strong growth in incomes had contributed to households\n\t\t\t\tadding considerably to savings during the June and September quarters of 2020. Members noted the\n\t\t\t\tsignificant uncertainty around whether and how quickly the savings ratio would return to more typical\n\t\t\t\tlevels, and how households would use the additional savings accumulated during 2020.</p>", "<p>Members observed that conditions in the housing market had been more resilient than expected, which had\n\t\t\t\tassisted the economic recovery. Housing prices had recently been rising across most of Australia\n\t\t\t\tfollowing an earlier period where conditions had been quite variable. This had returned the national\n\t\t\t\thousing price index to levels reached around 4 years earlier. Housing price increases had been\n\t\t\t\tlarger in regional Australia than in the capital cities; price levels in some smaller capital cities had\n\t\t\t\tincreased to new highs. Members noted that there were few signs of a deterioration in lending standards;\n\t\t\t\thowever, lending standards would be monitored closely in the period ahead.</p>", "<p>In their discussion of the outlook for wages growth and inflation, members noted that the forecasts\n\t\t\t\tunder the baseline scenario had increased a little relative to 3 months earlier, in line with the\n\t\t\t\tlower expected unemployment rate. However, both wages growth and underlying inflation were expected to\n\t\t\t\tremain below 2 per cent over the forecast period, reflecting ongoing spare capacity in the\n\t\t\t\teconomy.</p>", "<p>Members observed that wages growth had been subdued for a number of years and had recently declined\n\t\t\t\tfurther, to the lowest levels in at least 2 decades. Firms had responded quickly in the early\n\t\t\t\tstages of the pandemic by delaying wage increases, imposing wage freezes and, in some cases, applying\n\t\t\t\ttemporary wage cuts. Liaison contacts had suggested it could be some time before wage freezes were\n\t\t\t\tlifted. The improved outlook for activity and employment was expected to lift private sector wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth a little over the forecast period. However, this was partly offset by the downward revision to\n\t\t\t\tthe outlook for public sector wages growth, as some state governments had announced measures to cap\n\t\t\t\twages growth at rates below those seen in recent years.</p>", "<p>Turning to the outlook for inflation, members noted that underlying inflation pressures were subdued\n\t\t\t\tand expected to remain so in the period ahead. Although the outlook for underlying inflation had been\n\t\t\t\trevised up a little relative to 3 months earlier, ongoing spare capacity and low wages growth were\n\t\t\t\texpected to keep underlying inflation below 2 per cent over the forecast period. Members\n\t\t\t\trecalled the domestic and international experience prior to the pandemic, which suggested that a\n\t\t\t\tsustained period of labour market tightness would be needed to generate the faster wages growth required\n\t\t\t\tto see inflation return to the 2 to 3 per cent target range. Headline year-ended\n\t\t\t\tinflation was expected to increase temporarily to around 3 per cent in the June quarter 2021,\n\t\t\t\tlargely reflecting swings in the prices of child care, automotive fuel and some other administered\n\t\t\t\tprices. It was then forecast to fall back below 2 per cent by the end of the year and stay\n\t\t\t\tbelow 2 per cent over the remainder of the forecast period.</p>", "<p>Given the high degree of uncertainty around the outlook, members considered 2 plausible\n\t\t\t\talternative scenarios around the baseline forecast. In the baseline forecast, no further significant\n\t\t\t\toutbreaks of the virus were assumed to occur in Australia, although there could be some smaller\n\t\t\t\toutbreaks on the scale seen in recent months. Restrictions on domestic activity were assumed to be eased\n\t\t\t\tover the course of the year. Australia's international borders were assumed to remain closed until\n\t\t\t\tat least the end of the year.</p>", "<p>A downside scenario was considered by members, where further large outbreaks of the virus required the\n\t\t\t\treimposition of restrictions on activity, although not the extended lockdowns contemplated in previous\n\t\t\t\tdownside scenarios. Weaker activity would see the unemployment rate remain around\n\t\t\t\t6¾ per cent for most of 2021 and then decline only gradually thereafter. The larger\n\t\t\t\tdegree of spare capacity in the labour market would be expected to place further downward pressure on\n\t\t\t\twages growth and keep inflation trending lower until mid 2022.</p>", "<p>A plausible upside scenario was also discussed by members, which assumed that a run of positive health\n\t\t\t\toutcomes domestically and abroad enabled a faster easing of restrictions on activity. This would boost\n\t\t\t\thousehold and business confidence and, with it, private spending and investment. The stronger profile\n\t\t\t\tfor activity in this scenario would lead to a faster decline in the unemployment rate, which would fall\n\t\t\t\tto below 5 per cent by the end of 2022. Inflation would also rise a little faster in this\n\t\t\t\tscenario, but even still it would approach 2 per cent only by the end of the forecast\n\t\t\t\tperiod.</p>"], "International financial markets": ["<p>Members noted that global financial market conditions had remained very accommodative and monetary\n\t\t\t\tstimulus was expected to remain in place for some time. In the advanced economies, several central\n\t\t\t\tbanks, including the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and Sweden's\n\t\t\t\tRiksbank, had recently indicated that they would increase the size and/or extend the timeframe of their\n\t\t\t\tasset purchase programs. A number of central banks had also introduced lending facilities or enhanced\n\t\t\t\texisting facilities to support the flow of credit to the real economy. Members observed that the size of\n\t\t\t\tthe Bank's balance sheet relative to GDP remained lower than that of most other advanced economy\n\t\t\t\tcentral banks.</p>", "<p>Long-term government bond yields had increased over the preceding couple of months in most advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies, reflecting the upgraded growth outlook related to the rollout of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> vaccines and expected fiscal stimulus measures, notably in the United\n\t\t\t\tStates. Much of the increase in bond yields had reflected an increase in the compensation for inflation\n\t\t\t\tsought by investors. Members observed that government borrowing costs had remained low across advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies and issuance had continued to be met by strong demand.</p>", "<p>Corporate funding conditions had also remained highly accommodative and borrowing costs had remained\n\t\t\t\taround record lows. Investor confidence had been buoyed by the rollout of vaccines, new fiscal stimulus\n\t\t\t\tmeasures and sustained monetary stimulus, despite the challenges of rising <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases in some countries. Credit spreads had narrowed further and equity\n\t\t\t\tprices had increased. US equity prices had increased by more than in many other countries, partly\n\t\t\t\treflecting the higher share of technology-related stocks in US equity indices.</p>", "<p>The US dollar had depreciated further in response to the improvement in the medium-term global\n\t\t\t\tgrowth outlook. Commodity prices had also increased against this backdrop and the Australian dollar had\n\t\t\t\tappreciated back to around 2018 levels in trade-weighted terms. Members observed that, nonetheless, the\n\t\t\t\tadditional monetary policy stimulus as a result of the Bank's package of policy measures announced\n\t\t\t\tin November 2020 had contributed to the Australian dollar being noticeably lower than it would have been\n\t\t\t\totherwise.</p>"], "Domestic financial markets": ["<p>In Australia, the Bank's package of policy measures announced in November 2020 had led to a\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther easing of financial conditions. The cash rate had declined to 3 basis points and other\n\t\t\t\t\tshort-term money market rates had also declined to be close to zero.\n\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The 3-year Australian Government bond yield had been at the target of around 10 basis points,\n\t\t\t\t\tsupported by bond purchases on several occasions in mid November and early December. The Bank was\n\t\t\t\t\thalfway through the $100 billion bond purchase program. While longer-dated Australian Government\n\t\t\t\t\tbond yields had increased since early December, this largely reflected international developments and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe yield differential to US Treasuries had been broadly stable over that period. Staff estimates\n\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that longer-term Australian Government bond yields were around 30 basis points lower\n\t\t\t\t\tthan otherwise as a result of the bond purchase program. Members noted that government bond markets in\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralia continued to function smoothly for both Australian Government bonds and semis.\n\t\t\t</p>", "<p>After drawing down the bulk of initial Term Funding Facility (TFF) allowances by the end-September\n\t\t\t\t\tdeadline, banks had since drawn down only a small share of their additional and supplementary TFF\n\t\t\t\t\tallowances. Similar to the initial allowance period, further TFF drawings were expected to pick up\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards the end of the remaining drawdown period, which would finish in June 2021.\n\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Reductions in money market rates and retail deposit rates had further reduced banks' funding\n\t\t\t\t\tcosts. Borrowing rates for households and businesses had also declined to new lows. Reductions in\n\t\t\t\t\tborrowing rates since November had mostly been for fixed-rate home loans and for business loans under\n\t\t\t\t\tthe government's small and medium-sized enterprises loan guarantee scheme. The average rate paid\n\t\t\t\t\ton outstanding variable-rate housing loans had continued to drift gradually lower, reflecting ongoing\n\t\t\t\t\tcompetition for new high-quality borrowers and the effect of borrowers refinancing their loans.\n\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Funding conditions for Australian non-financial firms had remained highly accommodative. Credit\n\t\t\t\t\tspreads had narrowed further and Australian firms had been able to increase the tenor of their bond\n\t\t\t\t\tissuance in 2020. Equity prices had increased a little further since early December. While the ASX\n\t\t\t\t\t200 had risen noticeably since March 2020 – with a significant contribution from resource\n\t\t\t\t\tcompanies reflecting higher commodity prices – it had remained around 5 per cent below\n\t\t\t\t\tits peak early in 2020.\n\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Demand for housing finance had continued to pick up over preceding months, especially from\n\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers.

Investor housing loan commitments had also increased somewhat, but remained well\n\t\t\t\t\tbelow earlier peaks. Members noted that demand for new business loans had remained subdued, including\n\t\t\t\t\tfor small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\t\t\n\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for monetary policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy had\n\t\t\t\timproved over prior months owing to the development of vaccines. At the same time, the global recovery\n\t\t\t\thad lost some momentum around the turn of the year, as <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases had\n\t\t\t\tsurged again in many countries. The global outlook remained dependent on the path of the pandemic and on\n\t\t\t\tsignificant fiscal and monetary support. The recovery was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, and most\n\t\t\t\teconomies were expected to be well below their pre-pandemic trajectories for the level of output for\n\t\t\t\tsome time. Inflation remained low and below central bank targets in many economies.</p>", "<p>In Australia, the economic recovery was well under way and had been stronger than expected previously.\n\t\t\t\tThere had been strong growth in employment and a welcome decline in the unemployment rate. These\n\t\t\t\toutcomes had been underpinned by Australia's success on the health front and the very significant\n\t\t\t\tfiscal and monetary support. An important near-term issue was how households and businesses would adjust\n\t\t\t\tto the tapering of some fiscal support measures and to what extent they would use their stronger balance\n\t\t\t\tsheets to support spending. Members agreed that, while the recovery was expected to continue, the level\n\t\t\t\tof output remained noticeably below its pre-pandemic trajectory. The high unemployment rate and\n\t\t\t\tconsiderable spare capacity were expected to result in subdued wages growth and inflation over coming\n\t\t\t\tyears.</p>", "<p>The Bank's policy actions to date had been working broadly as expected. Together, the bond\n\t\t\t\tpurchases, the TFF and the targets for the 3-year bond yield and the cash rate were helping the economy\n\t\t\t\tby lowering financing costs for borrowers, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise,\n\t\t\t\tsupporting the supply of credit and supporting housing and business balance sheets. Since the start of\n\t\t\t\t2020, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $160 billion and a further substantial\n\t\t\t\tincrease was in prospect. The Bank had bought a cumulative $52 billion of government bonds issued\n\t\t\t\tby the Australian Government and the states and territories under the bond purchase program. The Bank\n\t\t\t\thad not purchased bonds in support of the 3-year yield target since early December 2020. Authorised\n\t\t\t\tdeposit-taking institutions had drawn down $86 billion of low-cost funding through the TFF and had\n\t\t\t\taccess to a further $99 billion under the facility. Members noted that the Australian banking\n\t\t\t\tsystem, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping to support\n\t\t\t\tthe economic recovery.</p>", "<p>The Board remained committed to doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy, and\n\t\t\t\tdecided to maintain the existing policy settings. Members concluded that very significant monetary\n\t\t\t\tsupport would be required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's goals for\n\t\t\t\tinflation and unemployment were achieved. Given this, it would be premature to consider withdrawing\n\t\t\t\tmonetary stimulus.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the bond purchase program, which was scheduled to be completed in mid April 2021.\n\t\t\t\tThey considered 3 factors: the effectiveness of the bond purchases; the decisions of other central\n\t\t\t\tbanks; and, most importantly, the outlook for inflation and employment. The Board assessed that the bond\n\t\t\t\tpurchase program had helped to lower interest rates and had contributed to a lower exchange rate than\n\t\t\t\totherwise. Australia's government bond markets continued to function well and further purchases\n\t\t\t\twere not expected to be a source of market dysfunction.</p>", "<p>A number of central banks in other advanced economies had announced extensions of their bond purchase\n\t\t\t\tprograms to at least the end of 2021, and there was a widespread expectation among market participants\n\t\t\t\tthat the Bank's program would be extended in some way. Given this, if the Bank were to cease bond\n\t\t\t\tpurchases in April, it was likely that there would be unwelcome significant upward pressure on the\n\t\t\t\texchange rate. Members discussed the outlook for the economy and concluded that it would be some years\n\t\t\t\tbefore the goals for inflation and unemployment were achieved. In view of these considerations, and the\n\t\t\t\tfact that the cash rate was at its effective lower bound, the Board resolved to purchase an additional\n\t\t\t\t$100 billion of bonds issued by the Australian Government and states and territories following the\n\t\t\t\tcompletion of the existing bond purchase program in mid April. These additional purchases would be at\n\t\t\t\tthe same rate of $5 billion per week, allocated on the same basis, namely around\n\t\t\t\t80 per cent Australian Government Securities and around 20 per cent bonds issued by\n\t\t\t\tthe states and territories. The decision to extend the bond purchase program would ensure a continuation\n\t\t\t\tof the Bank's monetary support for the Australian economy.</p>", "<p>Members reviewed the operation of the TFF and agreed that it had worked as intended by reducing\n\t\t\t\tborrowing costs and supporting the flow of credit, including for small and medium-sized enterprises. The\n\t\t\t\tBoard decided to maintain the existing terms of the facility. Banks will be able to draw on the facility\n\t\t\t\tuntil the end of June 2021, and continue to benefit from this low-cost funding through to mid 2024.\n\t\t\t\tThe Board would consider extending the facility if there were a marked deterioration in funding and\n\t\t\t\tcredit conditions in the Australian financial system. However, there had not been signs of such a\n\t\t\t\tdeterioration recently.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the operation of the target for the 3-year Australian Government bond yield.\n\t\t\t\tThis target had been effective in lowering short-term interest rates, which matter most for private\n\t\t\t\tborrowing and lending decisions. The target had also helped to anchor the Australian yield curve, and\n\t\t\t\treinforced the Bank's forward guidance regarding the cash rate. The Board determined that the\n\t\t\t\t3-year yield target would be maintained. Later in the year, the Board would need to consider whether to\n\t\t\t\tshift the focus of the yield target from the April 2024 bond to the November 2024 bond. In considering\n\t\t\t\tthis issue, members would give close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlook for\n\t\t\t\tinflation and employment.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the effect that low interest rates have on financial and macroeconomic\n\t\t\t\tstability. They acknowledged the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate\n\t\t\t\tenvironment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing\n\t\t\t\tmarket. The Board concluded that there were greater benefits for financial stability from a stronger\n\t\t\t\teconomy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.</p>", "<p>Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as\n\t\t\t\tnecessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will not\n\t\t\t\tincrease the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent\n\t\t\t\ttarget range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently.\n\t\t\t\tThis will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board does\n\t\t\t\tnot expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest.</p>"], "The decision": ["<p>The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:</p>", "<p>The Board agreed to purchase an additional $100 billion of government bonds when the existing bond\n\t\t\t\tpurchase program is completed in mid April 2021.

Global manufacturing and trade\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotably export orders, had continued to show signs of stabilising in late 2019.

In east\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsia, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth outlook had been supported by signs of a turnaround in the global electronics cycle and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulatory fiscal and monetary policies in some economies in the region. On the other hand, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor output growth in India had been revised lower given the broad-based slowing in economic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In major advanced economies, indicators for manufacturing and services activity had ticked up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand tight labour markets had supported growth in consumption.

In considering this case, the Board took into account that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates had already been reduced to a low level and that there are long and variable lags in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransmission of monetary policy. The Board also recognised that the incremental benefits of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rate reductions needed to be weighed against the risks associated with very low\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInternationally, concerns had been raised about the effect of very low interest rates on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresource\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallocation in the economy and their effect on the confidence of some people in the community,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotably\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose reliant on savings to finance their consumption. A further reduction in interest rates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencourage additional borrowing at a time when there was already a strong upswing in the housing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The Board concluded that the cash rate should be held steady at this meeting.

Many countries were imposing travel\n\t\t\t\trestrictions and businesses and individuals were electing not to travel. COVID-19 had also been\n\t\t\t\tcreating considerable uncertainty worldwide, leading to a significant reduction in risk appetites. This\n\t\t\t\tuncertainty meant that there was an increasing probability that people would seek to avoid gatherings,\n\t\t\t\tincluding public transport and perhaps workplaces.</p>", "<p>These developments were evident in the significant changes in global financial markets outside of China\n\t\t\t\tin recent weeks. There had been sharp falls in the prices of risky assets and markets were finding it\n\t\t\t\tdifficult to price the risks, given their unprecedented nature.</p>", "<p>In the advanced economies, equity markets had declined sharply from recent highs, with sectors most\n\t\t\t\texposed to COVID-19 disruptions experiencing particularly large falls. Spreads in corporate bond\n\t\t\t\tand money markets had widened, including in Australia, and issuance of corporate debt had slowed in late\n\t\t\t\tFebruary after a strong start to the year. However, members noted that while spreads had widened,\n\t\t\t\tcorporate borrowing costs had not risen much, if at all, because sovereign bond yields had declined to\n\t\t\t\tvery low levels. In a number of countries, including Australia, sovereign bond yields were at record\n\t\t\t\tlows. On the whole, international financial markets were functioning effectively despite the sharp rise\n\t\t\t\tin volatility.</p>", "<p>Members then turned to a discussion of international policy responses. Following the sharp adjustment\n\t\t\t\tto Chinese asset prices after the extended Lunar New Year break, the authorities in China had introduced\n\t\t\t\ta range of measures to forestall a tightening in financial conditions. This included monetary and fiscal\n\t\t\t\teasing targeted at supporting smaller firms in particular, with policymakers also indicating a\n\t\t\t\twillingness to ease policies. These measures had underpinned a stabilisation of onshore equity and\n\t\t\t\tcredit markets. Elsewhere in the region, some central banks had also eased monetary policy, and modest\n\t\t\t\tfiscal measures were being deployed in some countries. Financial market volatility in the region had\n\t\t\t\tincreased, but conditions had remained orderly.</p>", "<p>Central banks in the major advanced economies had acknowledged the uncertainty created by the outbreak\n\t\t\t\tof COVID-19. Some had signalled a preparedness to provide further monetary policy accommodation if\n\t\t\t\tconditions warranted. Market pricing had moved substantially, suggesting that central banks in the\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies were expected to ease monetary policy at upcoming policy meetings. The expectation\n\t\t\t\tthat central banks in the advanced economies would soon respond with easier policy had contributed to\n\t\t\t\tyields on long-term sovereign debt declining to historic lows in many markets.</p>", "<p>In foreign exchange markets, the Japanese yen had appreciated as concerns about\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 intensified. Members also noted that the US dollar had appreciated in recent months\n\t\t\t\tagainst most currencies. Regionally, the renminbi had been little changed and exchange rates in emerging\n\t\t\t\tAsia had depreciated somewhat, but in the context of broader US dollar strength. Members observed\n\t\t\t\tthat the Australian dollar was at its lowest level in more than a decade.</p>", "<p>Domestically, members noted that issuance of bank debt had slowed recently, but this partly reflected\n\t\t\t\tthe substantial volume of funding already to hand and the modest growth in bank credit. Bank funding\n\t\t\t\tcosts had declined a little over the prior month, with a modest widening in spreads more than offset by\n\t\t\t\tsharp declines in risk-free rates. The reductions in the cash rate in the previous year had brought bank\n\t\t\t\tfunding costs to historic lows, with retail deposit rates having fallen further in recent months.</p>", "<p>Lending rates were also at historic lows. While standard variable mortgage rates had declined by\n\t\t\t\t\taround 60 basis points since mid 2019, the average rate paid on outstanding variable-rate\n\t\t\t\t\tmortgages had drifted down by an additional 10 basis points beyond that. Members noted that, if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe downward drift in average rates paid continued at its recent pace, there would be full pass-through\n\t\t\t\t\tof the previous year's reductions in the cash rate to the average mortgage rate by\n\t\t\t\t\tmid 2020.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the factors contributing to this downward drift in average mortgage rates. In\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular, ongoing strong competition for new high-quality borrowers had seen new and refinancing\n\t\t\t\t\tborrowers receive lower interest rates than those paid by existing borrowers. Improving transparency\n\t\t\t\t\twould help address this. Some borrowers were also switching from interest-only loans to\n\t\t\t\t\tprincipal-and-interest loans, which had lower interest rates.</p>", "<p>Members observed that the growth in housing credit for owner-occupiers had increased a little over the\n\t\t\t\tprevious six months or so, but housing credit was growing more slowly than housing loan commitments,\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with a rise in mortgage payments over this period. Loan commitments to investors had\n\t\t\t\tincreased modestly over the same period, while housing credit for investors had stopped declining\n\t\t\t\trecently.</p>", "<p>Market pricing suggested that market participants expected the cash rate target to be cut by\n\t\t\t\t\t25 basis points at the present meeting, and again by June.</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that the spread of COVID-19 was\n\t\t\t\texpected to affect global growth in 2020 by more than had been factored into the forecasts presented at\n\t\t\t\tthe previous meeting.</p>", "<p>Actions taken by Chinese authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19 had severely restricted\n\t\t\t\teconomic activity in China in the March quarter and there continued to be significant uncertainty about\n\t\t\t\tthe size and persistence of this disruption. While industrial output was typically lower in the March\n\t\t\t\tquarter because of the Lunar New Year holiday period, production had remained at holiday levels for much\n\t\t\t\tlonger than usual. Coal consumption by power plants had also remained around the low levels typical of\n\t\t\t\tthe Lunar New Year period. Members noted that this had not reduced demand for coal imports, which\n\t\t\t\tsuggested that there had been a significant decline in China's domestic coal production. Iron ore\n\t\t\t\timports also had not been significantly affected. Business conditions in China in February had\n\t\t\t\tdeteriorated by much more than expected and supplier delivery times had increased sharply, indicating\n\t\t\t\tthat there had also been disruptions to supply chains. Retail activity and residential property sales\n\t\t\t\thad been subdued.</p>", "<p>Chinese GDP was expected to rebound later in 2020 as businesses seek to make up lost production and a\n\t\t\t\trange of stimulus and tax relief measures from the Chinese Government take effect. Some government\n\t\t\t\tmeasures, including direct support for manufacturers of medical equipment, were intended to support\n\t\t\t\tcontainment efforts, while others, such as assistance to affected small businesses, were designed to\n\t\t\t\treduce the adverse economic spillovers from COVID-19.</p>", "<p>Given the disruptions to logistics and other transportation in China, forecasts for global oil demand\n\t\t\t\thad been scaled back considerably and oil prices had fallen. This would lead to a decline in headline\n\t\t\t\tinflation globally. The prices of other commodities that tend to be responsive to changes in the outlook\n\t\t\t\tfor global demand, including base metals, had also fallen since the start of 2020. Prices for liquefied\n\t\t\t\tnatural gas had also declined. Prices of other bulk commodities had been little changed in net terms;\n\t\t\t\tiron ore prices had reversed an earlier fall, even as Chinese steel inventories had increased, possibly\n\t\t\t\tin anticipation of a pick-up in demand as economic activity rebounded.</p>", "<p>Growth in other Asian economies was also expected to be lower in the March quarter than previously\n\t\t\t\tthought, reflecting a combination of lower Chinese domestic demand, less Chinese outbound travel and\n\t\t\t\tsupply chain disruptions. Early indicators of trade activity in the Asian region in February had\n\t\t\t\tdeclined, following a period where trade, industrial production and manufacturing indicators in the more\n\t\t\t\texport-oriented economies had stabilised, amid signs of stabilisation in the global electronics cycle.\n\t\t\t\tOverall, growth in Australia's major trading partners was expected to be around\n\t\t\t\t½ percentage point lower in 2020 as a result of COVID-19.</p>", "<p>In the major advanced economies, GDP data for the December quarter had been weaker than expected for\n\t\t\t\tJapan and the euro area, while GDP growth in the United States had been relatively resilient. Even\n\t\t\t\tthough employment growth had eased over 2019 in the major advanced economies, unemployment rates had\n\t\t\t\tcontinued to edge lower. Prior to any supply disruptions related to COVID-19, industrial production in\n\t\t\t\tthe euro area had continued to decline, particularly in the auto sector. Members noted that, to date,\n\t\t\t\tthere had been no reports that supply disruptions were contributing to these declines. Some survey\n\t\t\t\tmeasures of business conditions in the United States and Japan had deteriorated sharply in February, but\n\t\t\t\tinvestment intentions and business sentiment in the United States had been more positive.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members noted that the December quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting.\n\t\t\t\tQuarterly GDP growth was expected to have remained moderate, reflecting ongoing weak growth in household\n\t\t\t\tconsumption and a further decline in dwelling investment. The bushfires over the summer months were\n\t\t\t\texpected to have affected growth in both the December quarter 2019 and the March quarter 2020, after\n\t\t\t\twhich recovery efforts were expected to boost growth.</p>", "<p>Members noted that economic activity in the first half of 2020 would be significantly affected by the\n\t\t\t\tglobal response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Services exports (which comprise around\n\t\t\t\t5 per cent of GDP) were expected to decline by around 10 per cent in the March\n\t\t\t\tquarter, mainly because of a steep decline in inbound arrivals, including students, particularly from\n\t\t\t\tChina. This effect alone was expected to lower Australian GDP growth by around ½ percentage\n\t\t\t\tpoint in the March quarter. Tourism and education exports were expected to remain low in the June\n\t\t\t\tquarter, before returning to their previous levels over the second half of the year as the Chinese\n\t\t\t\teconomy recovers and travel resumes. Members observed that this estimate did not include possible\n\t\t\t\teffects on domestic activity of supply chain disruptions and public health safety interventions to\n\t\t\t\treduce the likelihood of transmitting COVID-19.</p>", "<p>Information from the capital expenditure (capex) survey and preliminary data on non-residential\n\t\t\t\tconstruction work done suggested that both non-mining and mining investment had decreased in the\n\t\t\t\tDecember quarter, led by weakness in building and engineering investment. However, mining firms had\n\t\t\t\tcontinued to expect solid growth in investment over the rest of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span>.\n\t\t\t\tThe capex survey had also reported firms' investment intentions for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> for the first time. The responses suggested that mining investment\n\t\t\t\twould increase strongly, consistent with the most recent set of forecasts and the messages from liaison\n\t\t\t\twith businesses, while non-mining investment was expected to remain subdued.</p>", "<p>National housing price growth had remained robust in February and most capital cities had experienced\n\t\t\t\tat least moderate price increases. The strong growth in housing prices had also encouraged more new\n\t\t\t\tresidential listings, albeit from very low levels. Turnover had increased, which, by itself, was\n\t\t\t\texpected to help support other types of spending. Indicators of activity at the earlier stages of\n\t\t\t\tresidential building had remained consistent with a turnaround in activity in the second half of 2020,\n\t\t\t\tespecially for detached dwellings. However, data on residential building work done indicated dwelling\n\t\t\t\tinvestment had decreased again in the December quarter, driven by a further decline in the construction\n\t\t\t\tof new dwellings.</p>", "<p>Growth in household consumption was expected to have been subdued in the December quarter; retail sales\n\t\t\t\tvolumes had increased modestly and there had been further declines in motor vehicle sales in the\n\t\t\t\tquarter. A few categories of spending that are most correlated with housing activity had picked up in\n\t\t\t\tthe quarter. The drought had continued to affect food prices and the volume of food sales had declined\n\t\t\t\tin the quarter. Members noted that growth in consumption in the first quarter of 2020 could be weaker\n\t\t\t\tthan expected if the COVID-19 outbreak induced some households to cancel or defer international\n\t\t\t\ttravel or disrupted supply chains for imported consumer durables. Although there was considerable\n\t\t\t\tuncertainty about the size of the net effect on GDP, it was expected to be small based on the available\n\t\t\t\tevidence.</p>", "<p>Employment had grown by 1.9 per cent over the year to January, which was stronger than growth\n\t\t\t\tin the working-age population. However, the unemployment rate had increased to 5.3 per cent,\n\t\t\t\treversing the small decline in the previous month, and the underemployment rate had increased to\n\t\t\t\t8.6 per cent. The unemployment rate had been around 5¼ per cent for most of the\n\t\t\t\tpreceding year. Members noted that the labour force data could be volatile from month to month and that\n\t\t\t\tit was too soon to know if the modest rise in these measures of spare capacity signalled a change in\n\t\t\t\ttrend. The wage price index confirmed that growth in wages had remained steady at low rates in the\n\t\t\t\tDecember quarter, consistent with information from liaison with businesses, which suggested that wage\n\t\t\t\toutcomes had become increasingly concentrated in the 2–3 per cent range. Wages growth\n\t\t\t\thad slowed a little in some industries. These data and reports from liaison with businesses suggested\n\t\t\t\tthat wages growth was unlikely to pick up in the near future.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members observed that it was becoming increasingly clear that\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 would cause major disruption to economic activity around the world. The outbreak had\n\t\t\t\toccurred in the context of a global economy that was gradually emerging from a soft patch in trade and\n\t\t\t\tmanufacturing activity. However, following the outbreak, growth in output in China and other economies\n\t\t\t\twas expected to be significantly lower in the first half of the year, reflecting a combination of lower\n\t\t\t\tdomestic demand, less travel and supply chain disruptions. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 outside\n\t\t\t\tof China, and intensified efforts to contain its further spread, raised the prospect of a broader and\n\t\t\t\tmore extended disruption to the global economy. It was too early to tell how persistent these effects\n\t\t\t\twould be and at what point economic activity would rebound. In response to the outbreak, policy measures\n\t\t\t\tto support growth had been announced in several countries, including China. Inflation remained subdued\n\t\t\t\tin most advanced economies, despite low unemployment rates.</p>", "<p>Financial markets had been more volatile as market participants assessed the implications of COVID-19,\n\t\t\t\twith the prices of many risky assets falling sharply. The uncertainty generated by the outbreak, and an\n\t\t\t\texpectation that central banks would respond with easier policy, had resulted in long-term government\n\t\t\t\tbond yields falling to historic lows in many countries, including Australia. The Australian dollar had\n\t\t\t\tdepreciated to be at its lowest level in more than a decade. Australia's financial markets were\n\t\t\t\toperating effectively, and the Bank would continue to ensure that the Australian financial system had\n\t\t\t\tsufficient liquidity.</p>", "<p>The advent of COVID-19 around the world was having a significant effect on the Australian economy,\n\t\t\t\tparticularly in the education, transport and tourism sectors. The uncertainty associated with the\n\t\t\t\toutbreak was also likely to affect household spending and business investment in coming months. As a\n\t\t\t\tresult, GDP growth in the March quarter was likely to be noticeably weaker than previously expected, and\n\t\t\t\tit was difficult to predict how long it would take for the economy to return to more usual levels of\n\t\t\t\tactivity. Once the disruptions passed, GDP growth was expected to pick up, supported by the low level of\n\t\t\t\tinterest rates, high levels of spending on infrastructure, the lower exchange rate, stronger investment\n\t\t\t\tin the resources sector and recoveries in residential construction and household consumption. The\n\t\t\t\tAustralian Government had also indicated that it would assist areas of the economy most affected by the\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak.</p>", "<p>Given these developments, members considered how best to respond, noting that even prior to the\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak, progress towards full employment and the inflation target had been expected to\n\t\t\t\tbe only gradual. The COVID-19 outbreak was expected to delay that progress further.</p>", "<p>In discussing a possible monetary policy response, members welcomed indications from the Australian\n\t\t\t\tGovernment that fiscal measures would be taken to support investment, the cash flow of affected\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses and jobs. They also discussed the support that lower interest rates would provide to jobs and\n\t\t\t\teconomic activity through a lower exchange rate and a boost to aggregate cash flows for households and\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses. Members recognised that the combined monetary and fiscal responses would help the economy\n\t\t\t\tdeal with the challenges posed by COVID-19.</p>", "<p>As part of their deliberations, members considered a number of scenarios, including one where the\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak would be contained in the very near future and where there would be a rapid\n\t\t\t\trecovery in economic activity. In that scenario, the maximum effect of any additional monetary policy\n\t\t\t\tstimulus would be felt in the recovery phase, rather than in the short term, when policy support would\n\t\t\t\tmost be needed. However, this scenario was considered very unlikely, with the more realistic scenario\n\t\t\t\tbeing that the outbreak would have a significant effect on the Australian economy.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the risk that a further reduction in interest rates could encourage additional\n\t\t\t\tborrowing at a time when there was already a strong upswing in the housing market. In the current\n\t\t\t\tcontext of heightened uncertainty, that risk was not viewed as particularly high relative to the\n\t\t\t\tbenefits from lower interest rates.</p>", "<p>The Board concluded that it was appropriate to ease monetary policy further in response to the global\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak to provide additional support to employment and economic activity. Members agreed\n\t\t\t\tthat it was reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates would be required in\n\t\t\t\tAustralia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. Members also agreed on the\n\t\t\t\timportance of monitoring the rapidly changing developments closely in subsequent weeks and maintaining\n\t\t\t\tcontact to assess the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak for the economy.

The outbreak was noted as first and foremost a public health issue. Many countries\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshutting their borders and placing restrictions on businesses and individuals to slow the spread\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19.

Members noted that any further widening in spreads would translate directly into\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing costs, since government bond yields had very little further room to fall. Yields in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had also risen, although banks and highly rated non-financial corporations were still\n\t\t\t\t\t\table to\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccess these markets. The Australian banks had strong funding positions and did not need to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsource\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional funding from bond markets in the near term.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Government bond markets had displayed signs of dysfunction, with many participants seeking to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliquidate\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir portfolios. This had also affected traditionally safe and liquid markets, such as the US\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTreasury\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket. The increase in yields and volatility partly reflected the unwinding of highly leveraged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositions, and the constrained ability of dealers to absorb additional bonds after having\n\t\t\t\t\t\treached\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleverage and capital constraints. The dysfunction in the US Treasury market had spread widely,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven its\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant role as a pricing benchmark for the global financial system.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In foreign exchange markets, large repatriation flows had supported the yen, and the US dollar\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappreciated against most other currencies. Members observed that the Australian dollar had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the US dollar by around 10 per cent over the preceding month, to be at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits lowest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel since 2002. Among other advanced economies, the exchange rates of commodity exporters such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorway, Canada and New Zealand had also depreciated notably. Capital flight had been evident\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerging markets, with exchange rates depreciating against the US dollar and sovereign bond\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoving sharply higher.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In response to these developments, a number of major central banks had made sizable interest rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\treductions at unscheduled meetings. The Federal Reserve had cut its policy rate by 100 basis\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter an earlier cut of 50 basis points. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of New Zealand had each lowered policy rates to ¼ per cent, and interest\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than this in Japan and Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Central banks had expanded their standard open market operations to provide short-term liquidity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial institutions, including by lengthening the terms on which liquidity is extended. To\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian financial markets, the Bank had injected liquidity through its open market\n\t\t\t\t\t\toperations,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing Exchange Settlement (ES) balances from around $2.5 billion to $14 billion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also announced that it would be conducting daily operations at one- and three-month terms\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregular repurchase operations on terms of six months or longer. In a number of jurisdictions,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia, central banks had stated that they would purchase government bonds in secondary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport their smooth functioning.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that many central banks were introducing additional measures to support market\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctioning and promote the resumption of activity in corporate credit markets. The Federal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintroduced a commercial paper funding facility to provide a backstop for the market. The Bank of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEngland, acting as agent for the UK Treasury, had announced that it would purchase unlimited\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamounts of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommercial paper issued by non-financial firms with an investment grade credit rating. The Bank\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEngland and the European Central Bank had expanded funding schemes to encourage banks to lend to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses. There had also been an easing of bank regulatory requirements in many countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with a number of other central banks, had also lowered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost and\n\t\t\t\t\t\textended the terms of foreign currency borrowing through foreign exchange swap lines. This was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesigned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto alleviate the very high demand for US dollars from non-US entities that had issued debt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS dollars that needed to be refinanced.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members discussed how these developments and the rapidly changing situation were affecting the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor economic activity. The immediate outlook for the Australian and global economies was highly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertain, but members viewed it as very likely that most countries would experience a very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharp\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontraction in economic activity. Members considered the information available for the Chinese\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich indicated that there had been a large contraction in economic activity in the March\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators, such as coal usage, suggested that economic activity in China was beginning to pick\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough it was too early to assess the extent to which activity would recover in the June\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>While it was not possible to provide an updated set of forecasts for the economy given the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfluidity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe situation, it was likely that Australia would experience a very material contraction in\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity, which would spread across the March and June quarters and potentially longer. The size\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfall in economic activity would depend on the extent of the social distancing requirements, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpotential lockdowns, put in place to contain the virus. The composition of consumption was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanging\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderably, with spending at supermarkets and pharmacies increasing substantially, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending on\n\t\t\t\t\t\thospitality and other services was falling sharply. Many service industries were being severely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisrupted, with significant spillovers across the economy. There were likely to be significant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjob\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlosses over the months ahead, although the extent of this would depend on the capacity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretain employees during this period. At the same time, some industries were employing more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworkers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly those involved in the retail supply chain and delivering goods. In time, following\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontainment of COVID-19, the economy is expected to recover, but the timing of this was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertain.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>Following their review of recent developments in financial markets and the implications for\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity, members turned to how monetary policy could most effectively support the Australian\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the challenging period that lay ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members acknowledged that the primary response to the COVID-19 outbreak was to manage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople's health, but that other arms of policy, including monetary and fiscal policy, would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplay an\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant role in reducing the economic and financial disruption. Members noted the measures\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank had taken to support the Australian economy and operation of financial markets over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdays\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The Governor proposed a package of policy measures, which together would assist in supporting the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian economy through the period ahead. The focus of the package was on ensuring that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunding costs\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere low across the entire economy and that credit remained available to businesses and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould help build the necessary bridge to the economic recovery and support that recovery once\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak is contained.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The elements of the package were discussed in turn.</p>", "<p>1. A further reduction in the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent.</p>", "<p>The proposed cut in the cash rate to 0.25 per cent would bring the cumulative decline\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe preceding year to 1¼ percentage points. Members noted that this would be a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstantial\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing of monetary policy, which, to date, had been boosting the cash flow of businesses and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold sector as a whole and also helping trade-exposed industries through the exchange rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchannel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers acknowledged that very low interest rates have uneven effects and negative consequences\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople – especially those relying on interest income – but the evidence was that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates were benefiting the community as a whole.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members supported the proposal and agreed that the cash rate would not be increased from its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel until progress is made towards full employment and there is confidence that inflation will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustainably within the 2–3 per target cent range. Given this, it was considered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate would remain at a very low level for an extended period. Members also agreed that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate was now at its effective lower bound. Members had no appetite for negative interest rates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>2. A target for the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.</p>", "<p>Members considered a proposal to extend and complement the longstanding approach to target the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate, which forms the anchor point for the risk-free term structure, by also targeting a\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisk-free\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rate further out along the yield curve. The specific proposal was to target the rate at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree-year mark, given its importance as a benchmark rate in financial markets and its role in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross much of the Australian economy. Such a target would also be consistent with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectation that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate would remain at a very low level for several years.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members supported the intent of the proposal and agreed that it would make most sense, including\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunication perspective, to set the target at the same rate as the target for the cash rate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnamely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t25 basis points. They acknowledged that the target did not need to be achieved precisely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevery day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that some time might be needed before yields would fall to the target from their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the weeks preceding the meeting – of around 45 basis points. Members discussed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportance of the Bank's communication focusing on how this target would both support the\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the immediate period and assist with a strong recovery once the COVID-19 outbreak has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontained.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that the yield target would be achieved by regular auctions in the secondary bond\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereby the Bank would implement a program to purchase bonds of different maturities, given the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of substitutability between bonds. The Bank would also be prepared to buy semi-government\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurities to achieve the target and help facilitate the smooth functioning of the bond market,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould work closely with the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) and state\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing authorities. Members noted that, although the program of bond purchases would entail\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in the size of the Bank's balance sheet, the focus of the program would be on bond\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than the quantity and timing of bond purchases. The objective of this component of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy measures would be to add to the downward pressure on funding costs for financial\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds and businesses.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members thought it likely that the target for three-year yields would be maintained until\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogress was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade towards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target. Furthermore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpressed the view that it would be appropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas raised.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>3. A term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-sized businesses.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The proposed scheme had two broad objectives. The first was to lower funding costs for the entire\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanking system to ensure a low cost of credit to households and businesses. This objective would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplement the target for the three-year bond yield. The second objective was to provide an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincentive\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor lenders to support credit to businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreed that this aspect would be vital as many small businesses would be likely to find\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretaining staff\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the period ahead extremely challenging.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Under the proposed facility, the Bank would provide a three-year funding facility to authorised\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeposit-taking institutions (ADIs) at a fixed rate of 0.25 per cent, which was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstantially\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow lenders' current funding costs. ADIs would be able to obtain initial funding of up to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3 per cent of their existing outstanding credit until the end of September 2020, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave access to additional funding if they increased lending to businesses, especially to small\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-sized businesses, with these funds able to be drawn upon until the end of March 2021.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis size\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the proposed facility was at least $90 billion. Members endorsed the proposal that no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowance be available to finance growth in lending for housing.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members expressed support for the proposed scheme and discussed some technical aspects. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions accessing the scheme would need to provide eligible collateral to the Bank, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaircuts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapplying to provide appropriate risk mitigation. The interest rate that would apply would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfixed for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe term of the funding, which was consistent with the Bank's expectation that the cash\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to stay at a very low level for some time. Members also agreed that including a penalty\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcounteract the risk of a reduction in lending could act as a disincentive for institutions to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipate in the scheme. The Governor indicated that the first drawings under the facility\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible no later than four weeks from the date of the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The Governor informed members that he understood that the Australian Prudential Regulation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAuthority\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(APRA) would support ADIs using the scheme. In addition, the Australian Government was in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprocess of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloping a complementary program of support for the non-bank financial sector, small lenders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecuritisation market, which would be implemented by the AOFM. Members observed that such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe important to assist non-bank financial institutions and small lenders to continue to provide\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto households and businesses.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>4. Exchange settlement (ES) balances at the Reserve Bank to be remunerated at 10 basis\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints,\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than zero as would have been the case under the previous arrangements.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The Governor outlined the implications of the proposed policy measures for the cash market. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\texisting ‘corridor system’ means that the balances financial institutions hold with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve Bank overnight earn an interest rate 25 basis points below the cash rate, and in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe event\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a financial institution needed to borrow from the Reserve Bank overnight, it would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharged\n\t\t\t\t\t\t25 basis points above the cash rate. Should the cash rate be reduced to 25 basis\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rate on ES balances would be zero. In view of the significant increase in the balances\n\t\t\t\t\t\theld in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tES accounts resulting from the combined effect of the Bank's enhanced liquidity operations,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurchases and the term funding program, maintaining a zero interest rate on these balances would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease the costs to the banking system.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members agreed that such an outcome would be undesirable in the current environment. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tendorsed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposal to alleviate this cost by increasing the rate of interest on settlement balances to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10 basis points. No change to the arrangements for the top of the corridor were proposed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the increase in ES balances would be likely to change the way that the cash market\n\t\t\t\t\t\toperates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn particular, large increases in ES balances could result in the cash rate drifting below the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransaction volumes in the cash market decline, as had occurred in other countries in similar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In considering the overall package of measures that had been discussed, members acknowledged that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm funding scheme and the three-year bond yield target were both significant policy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not have been under consideration in normal times.

The outbreak was first and foremost a public health issue, but was\n\t\t\t\talso having very large adverse effects on economies and financial systems around the world. Financial\n\t\t\t\tconditions had been highly volatile in March, reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook,\n\t\t\t\tincreased uncertainty and a substantial increase in demand for cash over other assets. Central banks had\n\t\t\t\tresponded forcefully with a wide range of policy measures. In response to these measures and sizeable\n\t\t\t\tresponses from fiscal authorities, financial conditions had stabilised but remained fragile.</p>", "<p>Central banks had taken actions to lower risk-free rates across the yield curve. Policy rates had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen reduced where there was scope to do so, and were at ¼ per cent or lower in all of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe major advanced economies. Purchases of government bonds had been scaled up significantly. As a\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of these purchases, central bank balance sheets had expanded rapidly in March.</p>", "<p>Central banks had also sought to accommodate increased demand for cash and support market\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctioning. They had increased the provision of liquidity to the financial system by increasing the\n\t\t\t\t\tsize and extending the maturity of their regular open market operations. Many central banks had also\n\t\t\t\t\tsought to improve market functioning – particularly of key bond markets that provide important\n\t\t\t\t\tpricing benchmarks – by directly purchasing securities in secondary markets. The US Federal\n\t\t\t\t\tReserve had acted to help meet demand for US dollars from non-US entities, most notably by\n\t\t\t\t\tactivating and extending its network of bilateral swap lines with other central banks, including the\n\t\t\t\t\tReserve Bank of Australia.</p>", "<p>There had been a range of actions to support the supply of credit, particularly to businesses.\n\t\t\t\t\tCentral banks were introducing or expanding term funding schemes to provide low-cost funds to banks and\n\t\t\t\t\tencourage them to continue supplying credit to businesses and households. Prudential measures had made\n\t\t\t\t\tit easier for banks to expand their balance sheets. These measures had complemented actions by\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernments to assist business borrowers directly.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the actions taken by central banks in sovereign bond markets had helped to support\n\t\t\t\t\tmarket liquidity and put downward pressure on yields. Liquidity conditions in the market for US\n\t\t\t\t\tTreasuries (as reflected in bid-ask spreads) had improved since mid March, but had not yet fully\n\t\t\t\t\tnormalised. Declines in longer-term yields had been limited as market participants were factoring in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe prospect of significantly higher volumes of bond issuance to fund large fiscal deficits over the\n\t\t\t\t\tperiod ahead. Nevertheless, sovereign bond yields across the advanced economies remained at low levels.\n\t\t\t\t\tSpreads between Italian and Spanish yields and those of German Bunds had widened in early March as the\n\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreaks in those countries had intensified, and amid concerns about conditions in the\n\t\t\t\t\tbanking systems and the sustainability of their public finances. However, the new asset purchase\n\t\t\t\t\tprogram established by the European Central Bank had helped to contain the widening of these\n\t\t\t\t\tspreads.</p>", "<p>Conditions in US dollar funding markets had tightened significantly, although stresses in these\n\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had eased since mid March. Spreads in short-term unsecured US dollar funding markets had\n\t\t\t\t\trisen, reflecting increased demand for liquidity and limitations on the capacity of financial\n\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions to intermediate these markets. In response, the Federal Reserve had implemented several\n\t\t\t\t\tpolicy measures to increase the supply of US dollars, which had helped to stabilise or narrow\n\t\t\t\t\tspreads in some markets. The bilateral swap lines between the Federal Reserve and other major central\n\t\t\t\t\tbanks had been utilised extensively to provide US dollar liquidity to financial institutions,\n\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in Europe and Japan. In contrast, there had not been much demand for US dollar\n\t\t\t\t\tfunding from Australian financial institutions.</p>", "<p>Members noted that funding markets remained strained for corporations, particularly those whose\n\t\t\t\t\trevenues were most exposed to the economic impact of the measures to contain COVID-19 or were\n\t\t\t\t\thighly leveraged. Corporate bond spreads had risen, but overall borrowing costs were still modest by\n\t\t\t\t\thistorical standards, reflecting the historically low levels of government bond yields. Market\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions in primary corporate bond markets had been mixed. Corporations with high credit quality had\n\t\t\t\t\tissued record volumes of debt in March to build cash reserves. In contrast, issuance of high-yield debt\n\t\t\t\t\thad largely ceased. Other risky asset classes, such as equities, remained volatile.</p>", "<p>In emerging market economies, government bond yields had risen sharply, equity prices had fallen and\n\t\t\t\t\texchange rates had depreciated. There had also been substantial capital outflows. The tightening in\n\t\t\t\t\tfinancial conditions partly reflected concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on output growth in\n\t\t\t\t\tthese economies, particularly for commodity exporters and countries that had recently received finance\n\t\t\t\t\tin large part via foreign capital and/or in foreign currency. A number of emerging market and\n\t\t\t\t\tlow-income economies had engaged in discussions with international organisations about accessing\n\t\t\t\t\temergency financing facilities. In contrast, financial conditions in China had been stable in recent\n\t\t\t\t\tweeks, and Chinese equity prices had been relatively resilient.</p>", "<p>Movements in currencies had reflected strong demand for US dollars in the middle of March, with\n\t\t\t\tthe US dollar appreciating against currencies of both advanced and emerging economies. Particularly\n\t\t\t\tlarge moves had been observed in the exchange rates of commodity exporters. Since the start of the year,\n\t\t\t\tthe Australian dollar had depreciated against the US dollar through to mid March to its lowest\n\t\t\t\tlevel since the early 2000s before partly retracing, to be around 15 per cent lower in net\n\t\t\t\tterms.</p>"], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["<p>Members reviewed the implementation of the package of policy measures announced by the Bank on\n\t\t\t\t19 March and its initial effects on domestic financial conditions. The package included a reduction\n\t\t\t\tin the cash rate target to 0.25 per cent and introduction of a target for the yield on 3-year\n\t\t\t\tAustralian government bonds of around 0.25 per cent. The Bank had also announced that it would\n\t\t\t\tbe prepared to purchase government bonds across the yield curve to ensure the smooth functioning of\n\t\t\t\tgovernment bond markets. In addition, the package included a term funding facility (TFF) for authorised\n\t\t\t\tdeposit-taking institutions (ADIs), offering collateralised funding of at least $90 billion for\n\t\t\t\tthree years at an interest rate of 25 basis points, with additional amounts available to\n\t\t\t\tinstitutions that increase their lending to businesses, especially to small and medium-sized businesses.\n\t\t\t\tFinally, Exchange Settlement balances at the Bank would be remunerated at 10 basis points, rather\n\t\t\t\tthan zero as would have been the case under the previous corridor arrangements.</p>", "<p>The three-year government bond yield fell noticeably on the announcement of the policy package, from\n\t\t\t\taround 60 basis points to around 30 basis points, and declined a little further in response to\n\t\t\t\tbond purchases by the Bank, to be at the target of around 25 basis points. In addition to purchases\n\t\t\t\tof Australian government bonds at around three years, the Bank had also purchased government bonds\n\t\t\t\tacross the yield curve, including state and territory government bonds. The Bank had purchased in\n\t\t\t\taggregate around $36 billion of government bonds in secondary markets. This had contributed to\n\t\t\t\tgenerally improved functioning of these markets, including a reduction in bid-ask spreads and\n\t\t\t\tachievement of the three-year yield target. Furthermore, the Australian Office of Financial Management\n\t\t\t\t(AOFM) and state and territory government borrowing authorities had issued securities, consistent with\n\t\t\t\tmarket conditions having improved.</p>", "<p>Alongside these purchases, the Bank had injected around $50 billion of liquidity into the\n\t\t\t\tfinancial system through its daily open market operations to support credit and maintain low funding\n\t\t\t\tcosts in the economy. The Bank had provided this liquidity at longer terms than usual, with the average\n\t\t\t\tmaturity of the Bank's repurchase agreements increasing from around 30 days to 70 days.\n\t\t\t\tAs expected, the high level of Exchange Settlement balances had seen the cash rate decline below\n\t\t\t\t25 basis points, to be around 20 basis points at the time of the meeting. Market participants\n\t\t\t\texpected the cash rate to be around 15 basis points for an extended period, a little above the\n\t\t\t\t10 basis point deposit rate on Exchange Settlement balances.</p>", "<p>The package of policy measures was putting downward pressure on bank funding costs, offsetting the\n\t\t\t\teffects of higher spreads in some wholesale funding markets. The reduction in the cash rate and the\n\t\t\t\tincrease in Exchange Settlement balances had helped to lower short-term benchmark rates for bank\n\t\t\t\tfunding. In addition, funding was available through the TFF at substantially lower than market rates.\n\t\t\t\tADIs had started to draw down their allocations under the TFF on 6 April. The TFF was being\n\t\t\t\tcomplemented by other policy measures to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses, including\n\t\t\t\tthe government's guarantee of 50 per cent on new loans for working capital. In addition,\n\t\t\t\tthe AOFM had begun purchasing asset-backed securities as part of its program to support lending by\n\t\t\t\tnon-ADIs and small ADIs.</p>", "<p>The Bank's package of policy measures, along with other announced initiatives by the federal and\n\t\t\t\tstate governments and the Australian banks, was allowing households and businesses to access credit on\n\t\t\t\tconsiderably more favourable terms than otherwise. Banks had reduced interest rates for small business\n\t\t\t\tborrowers markedly, and small business customers affected by the COVID-19 outbreak would be able to\n\t\t\t\tdefer interest and loan payments for six months. For households, a large proportion of the monetary\n\t\t\t\tpolicy easing since May 2019 had flowed through to mortgage rates paid. Lenders had reduced their\n\t\t\t\tinterest rates on variable rate housing loans by 25 basis points following the reduction in the\n\t\t\t\tcash rate on 3 March. While most lenders did not reduce their standard variable rates following the\n\t\t\t\tfurther cut in the cash rate on 19 March, they had announced a reduction for interest rates on\n\t\t\t\tfixed rate loans and measures to defer interest and loan payments for distressed households.</p>"], "Financial Stability": ["<p>Members were briefed on the Bank's regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system.</p>", "<p>The COVID-19 outbreak had ended an extended period of low financial market volatility and low\n\t\t\t\t\trisk premiums, which had been underpinned by investors' expectations of continued benign economic\n\t\t\t\t\tand financial market conditions. Members noted that the current situation was very different from the\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal financial crisis, as the shock had not emanated from the financial system. As a result of\n\t\t\t\t\tregulatory reforms following the global financial crisis, banks were in a much stronger position than\n\t\t\t\t\tprior to the global financial crisis. Members noted that, rather than being a source of the shock, the\n\t\t\t\t\tfinancial system was well placed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</p>", "<p>Existing risks to financial stability were being amplified by the pandemic: debt had increased to\n\t\t\t\t\thigh levels in corporate and household sectors in some countries; some non-bank financial institutions\n\t\t\t\t\thad high leverage; and some European countries had weak banking systems and high sovereign debt. Banks\n\t\t\t\t\twere also facing increased operational risks given the need to operate from split sites and with most\n\t\t\t\t\tstaff working remotely.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the Australian banks were in a strong position to withstand the large economic\n\t\t\t\t\tshock from the COVID-19 outbreak and financial market volatility. The capital and liquidity\n\t\t\t\t\tpositions of the banks had increased substantially since the global financial crisis. Banks'\n\t\t\t\t\tleverage ratios (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to non-risk-weighted assets) had also increased. The\n\t\t\t\t\tliquidity coverage ratios of banks were well above their regulatory minimums and had recently increased\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther as a result of the TFF. Banks had high profits, their return on equity prior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak was well above their cost of equity, and they had low rates of bad and doubtful\n\t\t\t\t\tdebts. The expected contraction in economic activity would, however, result in a rising proportion of\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-performing loans. But banks were well placed to absorb these, given their strong capital buffers.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority had noted that the banks were able to access these\n\t\t\t\t\tbuffers to sustain credit growth in the economy.</p>", "<p>The decline in asset prices had had a significant effect on superannuation fund returns and some\n\t\t\t\t\tfunds would face additional withdrawals in the period ahead.</p>", "<p>Following the COVID-19 outbreak, banks and other financial institutions in Australia had\n\t\t\t\t\timplemented their business continuity plans. This involved large numbers of staff working from home and\n\t\t\t\t\tsplit sites to ensure there was redundancy in critical operations. This had required significant\n\t\t\t\t\tadaption of their continuity plans to the specific nature of the pandemic, but to date this had\n\t\t\t\t\tproceeded without major incident. Banks' changed operating environments and their resulting\n\t\t\t\t\treduced capacity to take on risk had affected the functioning of some markets. There were also\n\t\t\t\t\tincreased risks from failures of legacy IT systems and cyber attacks.</p>", "<p>Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, business balance sheets in Australia were generally in a healthy\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, as most companies had relatively low levels of gearing and sufficient liquid assets to weather a\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderate shock to their income. Australian companies had generally deleveraged since the global\n\t\t\t\t\tfinancial crisis. However, the contraction resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak would be a very\n\t\t\t\t\tlarge shock to many businesses, particularly in industries most exposed to the fall in economic\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity. The potential to reduce outlays through measures such as wage subsidies and rent\n\t\t\t\t\tre-negotiations, along with access to credit, were important measures to ensure the viability of as\n\t\t\t\t\tmany businesses as possible through the current crisis.</p>", "<p>Most households with mortgages had significant buffers of accumulated prepayments, with around half of\n\t\t\t\tthese loans having prepayments that exceeded six months of payments; the share of mortgages that may not\n\t\t\t\thave a buffer of liquid assets was around 15 per cent. Measures of household financial stress\n\t\t\t\thad been at relatively low levels prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Members were informed that, at\n\t\t\t\tthe time of the meeting, banks had reported that around 5 per cent of households had enquired\n\t\t\t\tabout deferring mortgage repayments.</p>", "<p>Risks from residential property markets had diminished over the course of the preceding year as\n\t\t\t\tincreases in housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne had led to a reduction in the share of households at\n\t\t\t\trisk of having negative equity on their housing assets. Nationally, around 3 per cent of\n\t\t\t\tmortgages had negative equity positions, with most of these in Western Australia. The more recent\n\t\t\t\teconomic contraction, uncertainty and social distancing measures were likely to result in very little\n\t\t\t\tturnover in the housing market. It remained unclear how this would affect residential property\n\t\t\t\tprices.</p>", "<p>Members noted that conditions in commercial property markets were deteriorating. This followed several\n\t\t\t\tyears of commercial property price growth in excess of growth in rents. Prior to the\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak, parts of the retail property market were facing challenging conditions owing to\n\t\t\t\tweak consumer spending and heightened competition. Following the outbreak, some retail tenants had been\n\t\t\t\tseeking suspensions in rent payments or large rent reductions. Members noted that the risks in\n\t\t\t\tcommercial property markets warranted close monitoring.</p>"], "International Economic Developments": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that the measures needed to contain\n\t\t\t\tthe COVID-19 outbreak would result in an economic contraction that would have been unimaginable a\n\t\t\t\tfew months earlier. The exact size of the contraction would depend on each economy's industry\n\t\t\t\tstructure and the public's responses. The lockdown and other containment measures were expected to\n\t\t\t\tremain in place for at least a couple of months in most countries, although there was considerable\n\t\t\t\tuncertainty about the extent of this, as well as the variability of the measures across countries.</p>", "<p>Most official data for advanced economies had not yet captured the full effects of domestic containment\n\t\t\t\tmeasures. Nonetheless, business surveys of conditions in the services sector had fallen considerably\n\t\t\t\tacross most advanced economies in March and labour market indicators had also deteriorated. In the\n\t\t\t\tUnited States, employment had fallen sharply and new claims on unemployment insurance had increased\n\t\t\t\trapidly; the unemployment rate had increased around 1 percentage point by the time of the survey in\n\t\t\t\tmid March, but this was likely to have escalated significantly by the end of March.</p>", "<p>Monthly indicators of industrial production in China had fallen sharply in January and February,\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with more timely indicators, such as coal consumption by power plants, which had remained low\n\t\t\t\tfollowing the Lunar New Year holiday. Retail sales had also fallen sharply and property markets had\n\t\t\t\teffectively shut. Through March, there had been signs of a recovery in a range of timely indicators,\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with some easing in containment measures, although members noted that the return to more\n\t\t\t\tnormal conditions had been more gradual than previously expected.</p>", "<p>The decline in economic activity following the containment measures in many economies had been\n\t\t\t\texacerbated by declines in trade and second-round income and demand effects. Accordingly, GDP was\n\t\t\t\tprojected to contract by at least 10 per cent in the United States, the euro area and China\n\t\t\t\tover a couple of quarters. The contractions in some of Australia's other trading partners,\n\t\t\t\tparticularly in Asia, were likely to be smaller, but still significant. These estimates were in line\n\t\t\t\twith those of international agencies. A number of emerging and low-income economies were in particularly\n\t\t\t\tvulnerable situations because they had less capacity in their health systems and they had been\n\t\t\t\texperiencing capital outflows; there had been growing concerns that a flight of capital could trigger a\n\t\t\t\tdeeper economic contraction in those countries.</p>", "<p>A recovery was expected once the COVID-19 outbreak was contained, but members noted that the\n\t\t\t\ttiming and speed of that recovery was highly uncertain and the possibility of renewed outbreaks\n\t\t\t\tpresented an additional downside risk. The recovery would be assisted by the very large responses of\n\t\t\t\tboth monetary and fiscal policy. The fiscal responses had been designed to sustain the productive\n\t\t\t\tcapacity of economies during the containment measures by reducing business failures, preserving\n\t\t\t\temployment and providing a level of replacement income for people who become unemployed or have their\n\t\t\t\twork hours reduced. The fiscal policy measures included: expanded unemployment benefits; direct payments\n\t\t\t\tto individuals; funding for small businesses; incentives to maintain employment; and deferments of tax\n\t\t\t\tpayments and other payment obligations. The fiscal response in many countries had been much larger than\n\t\t\t\tduring the global financial crisis.</p>", "<p>Most commodity prices had fallen noticeably in anticipation of weaker global demand, although prices of\n\t\t\t\tthe bulk commodities most significant for Australia's export revenues had been relatively\n\t\t\t\tresilient. The sharp decline in oil prices in preceding weeks had been partly a response to the decline\n\t\t\t\tin demand associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. But it had also partly been an independent shock,\n\t\t\t\tbecause some major producers had boosted supply for strategic reasons. For most economies, including\n\t\t\t\tAustralia, lower oil prices were expected to be disinflationary in the short run and would flow through\n\t\t\t\tto the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports over the course of the following few quarters. The\n\t\t\t\tlower oil prices had also meant that some LNG projects were now unlikely to go ahead within previously\n\t\t\t\texpected timeframes.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["<p>Members observed that most of the available domestic economic data pre-dated the COVID-19 outbreak\n\t\t\t\tand had been consistent with a gradual improvement in the Australian economy over 2020. In February, the\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had declined to 5.1 per cent and there had been a jump in private sector\n\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals. Housing prices had also risen strongly over February and had increased over March,\n\t\t\t\talthough market conditions deteriorated over the second half of the month.</p>", "<p>In March, the Australian Government had announced three packages of policies focused on providing\n\t\t\t\tassistance to households and business. The largest package had been the JobKeeper payment announced on\n\t\t\t\t30 March, which would provide a wage subsidy for businesses that had experienced a significant fall\n\t\t\t\tin turnover. The government had also announced that it would provide cash-flow support to small and\n\t\t\t\tmedium-sized businesses, and investment incentives to businesses with turnover of up to\n\t\t\t\t$500 million. By supporting employment, these policies were expected to provide a safety net for\n\t\t\t\thouseholds, helping them maintain their spending on necessities and other obligations. The government\n\t\t\t\thad also announced that it would provide some direct transfers to households, including a temporary\n\t\t\t\tincrease in the JobSeeker payment.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the policies should cushion the labour market adjustment and reduce the financial\n\t\t\t\tstress of households and businesses. However, they observed that it was unlikely that these policies\n\t\t\t\twould provide a strong boost to spending in the near term given the broadening shutdown of non-essential\n\t\t\t\tactivities and the restrictions placed on household activities. The states and territories had also\n\t\t\t\tcommitted to a number of spending packages, predominantly targeted at small and medium-sized businesses,\n\t\t\t\talong with providing support to households.</p>", "<p>Retail sales had increased in February, as strength in grocery sales had offset weakness in sales of\n\t\t\t\tclothing and some services. Members noted that liaison with retailers had highlighted a much larger\n\t\t\t\tshift in household spending patterns through March as social distancing measures were put in place.\n\t\t\t\tHousehold consumption spending was expected to be much lower than usual in the June quarter because\n\t\t\t\tspecific types of spending, including on travel, dining out and certain recreational services, were not\n\t\t\t\tpossible under the current restrictions. These estimates were in line with those for other advanced\n\t\t\t\tcountries subject to similar restrictions, as well as with indications of spending patterns from\n\t\t\t\tbusiness liaison and other private sector sources. Travel and other service exports, particularly\n\t\t\t\teducation, were also expected to remain very low for some time, on the assumption that current border\n\t\t\t\tcontrols would be in place for a number of months.</p>", "<p>Deferrals and cancellations of business investment plans had been a theme in discussions with liaison\n\t\t\t\tcontacts, and recent survey indicators of business conditions had fallen sharply. These discussions had\n\t\t\t\talso highlighted that weaker demand conditions, including for short-term rental accommodation, were\n\t\t\t\texpected to extend the weakness in residential construction. These effects on GDP were expected to be\n\t\t\t\tpartially offset by stronger public demand and the introduction of income support measures. In\n\t\t\t\tcombination, these considerations suggested that GDP could fall significantly in the June quarter and\n\t\t\t\tremain subdued in the September quarter. Real estate, hospitality and tourism, along with many parts of\n\t\t\t\tretail, essentially would not operate while the current restrictions remain in place, while some\n\t\t\t\tindustries, including health care, utilities and mining, would be less affected.</p>", "<p>Members noted that there would be a very sharp decline in hours worked, which was expected to be\n\t\t\t\tassociated with significant increases in both the unemployment rate and the number of people working\n\t\t\t\treduced hours. Although the JobKeeper subsidy was expected to increase the number of people remaining\n\t\t\t\temployed, household incomes were expected to be much lower.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members noted that the coordinated monetary and fiscal response,\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether with complementary measures taken by ADIs and other businesses, would soften the expected\n\t\t\t\t\teconomic contraction and help support the economy's recovery once the health crisis has passed and\n\t\t\t\t\trestrictions have been removed. These various responses were providing considerable support to\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralian households and businesses through this very difficult period. Members noted that the\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralian financial system remained resilient. It was well capitalised and in a strong liquidity\n\t\t\t\t\tposition, with these financial buffers available to be drawn upon if required to support the\n\t\t\t\t\teconomy.</p>", "<p>The policy package announced by the Bank on 19 March had helped to lower funding costs and\n\t\t\t\tstabilise financial conditions, and would support the expected recovery. The package had contributed to\n\t\t\t\tan easing of strains in government bond markets and the three-year Australian government bond yield had\n\t\t\t\tdeclined to be at the target of around 25 basis points. The Bank would continue to do what was\n\t\t\t\tnecessary to achieve the three-year yield target, with the target expected to remain in place until\n\t\t\t\tprogress was being made towards its goals for full employment and inflation. The Bank would also\n\t\t\t\tcontinue to promote the smooth functioning of these important markets. Members noted that, if conditions\n\t\t\t\tcontinued to improve, it was likely that smaller and less frequent purchases of government bonds would\n\t\t\t\tbe required.</p>", "<p>The Bank had injected substantial liquidity into the financial system through its daily open market\n\t\t\t\toperations to support credit and maintain low funding costs in the economy. Given the substantial\n\t\t\t\tliquidity that was already in the system and the commencement of the TFF, daily open market operations\n\t\t\t\twere likely to be on a smaller scale in the near term.

GDP in Australia's major trading\n\t\t\t\t\tpartners was expected to decline significantly over the first half of 2020. The timing and size of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraction in activity was likely to vary across countries, depending on the strictness and duration\n\t\t\t\t\tof the lockdowns, and on the industrial structure of their economies. When the restrictions are eased,\n\t\t\t\t\teconomies could be expected to begin to recover, supported by stimulus from both fiscal and monetary\n\t\t\t\t\tpolicy. Members noted that lingering concerns about the virus, including over possible renewed\n\t\t\t\t\toutbreaks, could nonetheless continue to weigh on the spending decisions of households and businesses.\n\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the global economy was expected to begin to recover in the second half of 2020, the\n\t\t\t\t\tInternational Monetary Fund was forecasting a large contraction for 2020 as a whole.</p>", "<p>The Chinese economy had contracted by almost 10 per cent in the March quarter. While some\n\t\t\t\t\tparts of the economy had already begun to recover in the month of March as restrictions were eased,\n\t\t\t\t\tmembers noted that the improvement had been uneven. Industrial production had recovered strongly in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmonth and other timely indicators suggested that activity more broadly was approaching pre-outbreak\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels. Exports had also recovered to a large extent, and members noted that concerns about\n\t\t\t\t\tChina-related disruptions to global supply chains had receded. In contrast, fixed asset investment had\n\t\t\t\t\tpicked up only modestly and retail spending had remained subdued.</p>", "<p>In the major advanced economies, GDP was expected to contract from peak to trough by between\n\t\t\t\t\t10 and 15 per cent because of lockdowns and other restrictions on activity. Most of this\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraction was expected to occur in the June quarter, although some of the effect had been apparent in\n\t\t\t\t\tfigures for the March quarter; in that period, GDP had contracted by 1.2 per cent in the\n\t\t\t\t\tUnited States and by 3.8 per cent in the euro area. Survey data had recorded sharp declines\n\t\t\t\t\tin business conditions in April, particularly in the services sector, which had been most affected by\n\t\t\t\t\tcontainment measures.</p>", "<p>Some economies in Asia, including South Korea, were expected to have smaller contractions in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst half of 2020 because their restrictions had been more targeted. However, economies across the\n\t\t\t\t\tregion had faced weak external demand, initially from China and more recently from other trading\n\t\t\t\t\tpartners. Service exports had been particularly affected given that inbound tourism had essentially\n\t\t\t\t\tceased as a result of travel restrictions. India's economy had been under a relatively stringent\n\t\t\t\t\tnationwide lockdown since late March, although there had been some easing in early May.</p>", "<p>The labour market implications of the lockdowns and social distancing measures had been severe. For\n\t\t\t\t\texample, claims for unemployment benefits had reached unprecedented levels in the United States and\n\t\t\t\t\tCanada, and unemployment rates were expected to have risen to double digits in many advanced economies\n\t\t\t\t\tin April. Wage subsidy schemes were expected to have tempered the increase in unemployment in some\n\t\t\t\t\teconomies, including Germany. These schemes were also expected to support the subsequent recovery by\n\t\t\t\t\tavoiding a wide-scale severing of employment relationships.</p>", "<p>The decline in global demand had affected the prices of many commodities, especially oil. Production\n\t\t\t\t\tcuts agreed by major oil producers had not been enough to offset this. The fall in oil prices would\n\t\t\t\t\tflow through to contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) with a lag; in response, some large LNG\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestment projects in Australia had been deferred. In contrast, iron ore prices had been supported\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause Chinese demand had held up and supply from Brazil had remained constrained. More generally,\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal inflation was expected to decline and remain low for some time given the weakness in aggregate\n\t\t\t\t\tdemand.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook": ["<p>The Australian economy had been severely affected by the imposition of measures to contain the\n\t\t\t\t\toutbreak of COVID-19. Australian GDP was expected to contract by around 10 per cent over the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst half of 2020. Most of the contraction was expected to occur in the June quarter, although a\n\t\t\t\t\tdecline in travel service exports and some domestic spending had weighed on activity in the March\n\t\t\t\t\tquarter. An economic contraction of such speed and magnitude would be unprecedented in the 60-year\n\t\t\t\t\thistory of Australia's quarterly national accounts. Members noted that the nature of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraction and the expected recovery was also unprecedented because they were driven by public health\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasures, rather than induced by economic or financial factors.</p>", "<p>Retail spending had increased strongly in March because households had prepared for the period of\n\t\t\t\t\tsocial distancing and potential supply chain disruptions by stocking up on some grocery and\n\t\t\t\t\tpharmaceutical items and purchasing household goods such as home office and exercise equipment; in\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrast, spending in cafes and restaurants had fallen very significantly. Overall, preliminary data\n\t\t\t\t\tfor March indicated that retail sales had experienced one of the largest monthly increases in the\n\t\t\t\t\thistory of the series, similar in size to the increase in retail sales in the lead-up to the\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduction of the goods and services tax in 2000. However, estimates from retailers in the\n\t\t\t\t\tBank's business liaison program suggested that retail sales had fallen in April. Spending on\n\t\t\t\t\tservices and other categories of consumption was also expected to have fallen, consistent with the\n\t\t\t\t\tsocial distancing and travel restrictions that had been put in place.</p>", "<p>Household consumption was expected to contract by around 15 per cent over the first half of\n\t\t\t\t\t2020. Members observed that, as restrictions were lifted, the effects of lower employment, incomes and\n\t\t\t\t\twealth would become relatively more important for the consumption outlook.</p>", "<p>Social distancing restrictions on home inspections and in-person auctions, as well as heightened\n\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty about the future, had significantly reduced turnover in the established housing market.\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that some of the concerns that construction activity could be severely affected in the\n\t\t\t\t\tnear term by supply chain disruptions and health-related site closures had not been realised. However,\n\t\t\t\t\tcontacts in the liaison program had reported that demand for both new and established housing had\n\t\t\t\t\tfallen. Lower incomes and confidence, as well as lower expected population growth, were expected to\n\t\t\t\t\taffect demand for new housing for an extended period. Members also discussed the effect of a possible\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease in the number of people moving back home or living in larger households for financial reasons.\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the supply of rental housing had been boosted as properties that had previously been\n\t\t\t\t\toffered as short-term accommodation were shifted to the long-term rental market.</p>", "<p>Businesses had been grappling with deteriorating economic conditions and low confidence about future\n\t\t\t\t\tdemand. Many liaison contacts had reported that they were taking steps to preserve cash flow, including\n\t\t\t\t\tdeferring non-essential investment. Non-mining business investment was therefore expected to decline\n\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly. Mining investment was likely to be relatively more resilient, although weaker than\n\t\t\t\t\tpreviously expected largely because of deferred LNG projects.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the impact on investment of possible changes in the pattern of activity after\n\t\t\t\t\tthe recovery. Examples included the potential for significant changes in demand for office space if\n\t\t\t\t\tmore people worked from home on a regular basis, and a continuing shift of retail activity away from\n\t\t\t\t\tbricks-and-mortar stores if retailers expand their online operations.</p>", "<p>The March labour force survey had referenced the first half of the month and therefore had not shown\n\t\t\t\t\tsigns of contraction; employment had increased modestly and the unemployment rate had been\n\t\t\t\t\t5.2 per cent. However, payroll data published by the ABS indicated that over the five weeks\n\t\t\t\t\tto mid April there had been a significant decline in the number of paid jobs across many industries,\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially those related to tourism, entertainment and dining out. As well as being the activities most\n\t\t\t\t\taffected by social distancing requirements and movement restrictions, these industries employ a high\n\t\t\t\t\tshare of workers on casual arrangements. Job advertisements had declined noticeably in March and April.\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, at the same time, firms in some industries, including agriculture, were looking to\n\t\t\t\t\temploy more workers.</p>", "<p>Overall, the peak-to-trough decline in total hours worked was expected to be around\n\t\t\t\t\t20 per cent; this was expected to be larger than the decline in output, partly because many\n\t\t\t\t\tof the most-affected activities were highly labour-intensive. ABS surveys of households and businesses\n\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that some of the labour market adjustment had occurred through lower average hours worked by\n\t\t\t\t\tthose remaining in employment rather than through job losses. Information from the business liaison\n\t\t\t\t\tprogram suggested that many firms had asked staff to take paid leave or work shorter hours. These weak\n\t\t\t\t\tlabour market conditions were in turn expected to result in slower wages growth; wage freezes were\n\t\t\t\t\tlikely to become more common, and there had already been isolated reports in liaison of wage\n\t\t\t\t\tcuts.</p>", "<p>The unemployment rate was expected to peak at around 10 per cent in the June quarter.\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that this figure would have been much higher were it not for the JobKeeper wage subsidy\n\t\t\t\t\tscheme. The temporary suspension of job search requirements for eligibility for the JobSeeker\n\t\t\t\t\tunemployment benefit was also expected to lower measured unemployment rates, as some recipients would\n\t\t\t\t\tnot actively search for work, in part because public health measures had made doing so more difficult.\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that, despite the size and breadth of these programs, some people who had lost work\n\t\t\t\t\twould not be eligible for either payment.</p>", "<p>The outlook for the labour market suggested that growth in labour income would fall in the near term,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough the increase in social assistance payments would provide some support to household incomes\n\t\t\t\t\tover this period. Lower interest payments had already provided a small boost to the disposable incomes\n\t\t\t\t\tof households with mortgages and other debt. In terms of government finances, members noted that lower\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold income growth would result in lower tax receipts at the same time as there was an increase in\n\t\t\t\t\tsocial assistance payments and other fiscal stimulus measures.</p>", "<p>Inflation pressures had increased a little up to the March quarter. Year-ended CPI inflation had been\n\t\t\t\t\t2.2 per cent and trimmed mean inflation had been 1.8 per cent. The effect of the\n\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak on prices had been limited in the quarter, although it had been evident in the\n\t\t\t\t\tprices of items where retail demand was strongest in March, in particular rice, pasta and non-durable\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold products such as toilet paper, soap and hand sanitiser. Grocery prices had continued to be\n\t\t\t\t\tboosted by the effects of drought in the March quarter.</p>", "<p>The COVID-19 restrictions were expected to have a very large effect on prices in the June\n\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Headline CPI was expected to fall by around 2¼ per cent in the June quarter,\n\t\t\t\t\tdriven by the decline in petrol prices and the removal of childcare fees. More generally, government\n\t\t\t\t\tactions to reduce some administered prices in the current environment, while assisting households, were\n\t\t\t\t\talso expected to contribute to lower inflation in the near term. The anticipated slowing in growth in\n\t\t\t\t\tlabour costs and decline in rent inflation were expected to put downward pressure on inflation over the\n\t\t\t\t\tforecast period. These factors were expected to more than offset any price rises stemming from supply\n\t\t\t\t\tdisruptions or the depreciation of the exchange rate.</p>", "<p>Members noted that beyond the first half of 2020, the outlook for the domestic economy would depend\n\t\t\t\t\ton how long restrictions on economic activity were in place and how long uncertainty and diminished\n\t\t\t\t\tconfidence weighed on the spending, hiring and investment plans of households and businesses. Given the\n\t\t\t\t\tuncertainties, members considered three plausible scenarios for the outlook.</p>", "<p>The baseline scenario assumed that the process of relaxing social distancing measures would continue\n\t\t\t\t\tover coming months, but that restrictions on large gatherings and national border controls would remain\n\t\t\t\t\tin place until towards the end of the year. Under the baseline scenario, the economy was expected to\n\t\t\t\t\tbegin recovering gradually over the second half of 2020. However, the level of output was expected to\n\t\t\t\t\tremain lower – and the unemployment rate higher – at the end of the forecast period than\n\t\t\t\t\thad been projected in February.</p>", "<p>Australia had achieved a relatively rapid decline in new cases of COVID-19 and some states had\n\t\t\t\t\talready relaxed some restrictions. Members therefore also contemplated an upside scenario that assumed\n\t\t\t\t\tmost domestic activity restrictions would be relaxed sooner and that the economy would recover somewhat\n\t\t\t\t\tfaster than in the baseline scenario. In this scenario, it was likely that employment growth and\n\t\t\t\t\tspending would recover more rapidly, while the unemployment rate would decline more quickly; better\n\t\t\t\t\thealth outcomes elsewhere in the world would reinforce this positive dynamic. The level of GDP at the\n\t\t\t\t\tend of the forecast period in this scenario would still be lower than had been expected in February, in\n\t\t\t\t\tpart because of the lags involved in non-residential construction projects and the deferral of large\n\t\t\t\t\tLNG projects.</p>", "<p>Members also considered a more negative scenario, which could occur if the lifting of restrictions were\n\t\t\t\tto be delayed or the restrictions needed to be reimposed. In this scenario, there could be ongoing\n\t\t\t\tconcerns about the virus, and a slower pick-up in spending even after the restrictions were lifted\n\t\t\t\tbecause household and business confidence would remain low for longer. GDP would be expected to remain\n\t\t\t\taround its trough for several quarters and unemployment near its peak into the following year. The\n\t\t\t\tsubsequent recovery would also be slower than in the other scenarios, even if the virus were eventually\n\t\t\t\tcontained, because the longer downturn would involve more job losses and business failures, and\n\t\t\t\ttherefore do more lasting damage to employer–employee connections and supplier networks.</p>", "<p>Inflation was expected to remain below the trajectory anticipated in February in all three scenarios.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main differences in the expected paths for inflation related to different degrees of spare capacity\n\t\t\t\t\tin the labour market, resulting in growth in labour costs slowing to varying degrees.</p>"], "International Financial Markets": ["<p>Following the sharp tightening in March, financial conditions in many economies eased in April, aided\n\t\t\t\tby extensive policy measures by central banks and governments and reflecting less pessimism amid a\n\t\t\t\tslowing in the spread of COVID-19 in most advanced economies.</p>", "<p>Members noted that market functioning in sovereign bond markets had improved significantly, as had\n\t\t\t\tconditions in key money markets. As a result, a number of central banks had scaled back bond purchases\n\t\t\t\taimed at supporting market functioning, as well as the extent of their market operations to provide\n\t\t\t\tliquidity. This was also the case in Australia. Sovereign bond yields had stabilised or declined\n\t\t\t\tslightly in April in a number of advanced economies, including in Australia, to be at or near historic\n\t\t\t\tlows. This was despite the issuance of public debt having picked up noticeably and it being likely to\n\t\t\t\tremain at historically high levels in the period ahead.</p>", "<p>Since early April, a number of central banks in advanced economies had also expanded existing programs\n\t\t\t\tor introduced new programs to support the provision of credit to specific sectors or markets that\n\t\t\t\tremained under strain. Members noted that this had helped to lower borrowing costs for some\n\t\t\t\tcorporations, and state and local governments in some economies. Central banks had made clear that they\n\t\t\t\tstood ready to provide further stimulus if required.</p>", "<p>The easing in financial conditions through April was evident in a range of other indicators, but had\n\t\t\t\tnot been uniform. Corporate credit spreads had tightened and bond issuance in the United States and\n\t\t\t\tEurope had rebounded strongly, with a resumption of investment flows into credit-focused money market\n\t\t\t\tand corporate bond funds. At the same time, many corporations had drawn on pre-existing credit lines as\n\t\t\t\ta source of funding. Nevertheless, for lower-rated corporate and sovereign borrowers, funding costs\n\t\t\t\tremained higher than before the onset of the pandemic and market conditions remained fragile. This\n\t\t\t\tincluded parts of Europe, where there was a risk of sovereign credit rating downgrades and borrowing\n\t\t\t\tcosts remained volatile.</p>", "<p>Members also noted that equity prices in many advanced economies, including Australia, had recovered\n\t\t\t\taround half the losses since their trough in late March, reflecting a slowdown in the spread of\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 and the strong policy responses. Nevertheless, valuations for certain sectors, including\n\t\t\t\tbanks and energy companies, had fallen materially over the preceding quarter or so. This reflected\n\t\t\t\texpectations of a particularly challenging period for earnings growth and capital raising for those\n\t\t\t\tindustries in the months ahead. Volatility of equity prices overall remained higher than longer-term\n\t\t\t\taverages. These developments in global equities had also been observed in Australia.</p>", "<p>In China, conditions in financial markets had remained relatively stable throughout the\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 pandemic and credit growth had continued at a steady pace. As in the financial crises of\n\t\t\t\t2008 and 1998, the renminbi had remained stable, with foreign exchange reserves having declined a little\n\t\t\t\tfrom high levels. Financial conditions in other emerging market economies had recently stabilised after\n\t\t\t\ta sharp tightening in March. The return of capital flows and policy easing domestically and in advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies had supported asset prices, and exchange rates had appreciated somewhat. However, members\n\t\t\t\tnoted that substantial risks in emerging markets remained, particularly for those economies that are\n\t\t\t\tvulnerable to a sustained period of low commodity prices and/or have sizeable foreign debt, particularly\n\t\t\t\twhere denominated in foreign currencies and unhedged.</p>", "<p>Like many other financial markets, the functioning of global foreign exchange markets had improved,\n\t\t\t\thelped in part by the supply of US dollars made available through foreign exchange swap lines. But\n\t\t\t\tconditions had yet to return fully to those prevailing prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Over the\n\t\t\t\tpreceding few weeks, the US dollar had recorded a small but broad-based depreciation after\n\t\t\t\tappreciating strongly during the first quarter of the year. Members also noted the appreciation of the\n\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar from its low point in mid March. This had followed an earlier period where the\n\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar had depreciated even more sharply, such that the exchange rate remained around\n\t\t\t\t5 per cent lower over the year to date.</p>"], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["<p>The package of monetary policy measures implemented by the Bank in mid March was working broadly as\n\t\t\t\t\texpected.</p>", "<p>Since mid March, the Bank had purchased a total of about $50 billion of Australian Government\n\t\t\t\t\tSecurities (AGS) and semi-government securities (semis). The yield on 3-year AGS had remained at the\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget of around 25 basis points and market functioning had significantly improved for government\n\t\t\t\t\tbonds. Daily volatility in AGS bond yields and bid-offer spreads had declined since their peaks in mid\n\t\t\t\t\tMarch, while measures of market depth had increased. Consequently, the Bank had gradually reduced the\n\t\t\t\t\tsize, and more recently the frequency, of its bond auctions, which initially had been conducted daily.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis had occurred at the same time as there had been a large increase in the issuance of both AGS and\n\t\t\t\t\tsemis, which had been achieved at low yields. The various tenders for AGS had been met by consistently\n\t\t\t\t\tstrong demand, and the yield curve had shifted down significantly since early March. The amount and\n\t\t\t\t\tmaturity of the Bank's daily open market operations had also been scaled back over the prior month\n\t\t\t\t\tin response to improving market conditions and reduced demand for liquidity from the Bank's\n\t\t\t\t\tcounterparties. This reflected the ample liquidity already in the banking system, including as a result\n\t\t\t\t\tof other elements of the Bank's policy package.</p>", "<p>Members noted that, in response to the large amount of liquidity in the banking system, Exchange\n\t\t\t\t\tSettlement balances held by banks were high, reducing banks' need to borrow from each other in the\n\t\t\t\t\tovernight market. Consequently, the cash rate had drifted a little lower, to be around 14 basis\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints, where market participants expected it to remain for some time.</p>", "<p>The package of monetary policy measures had also contributed to a further decline in bank funding\n\t\t\t\t\tcosts. Members noted that deposit rates, and short- and long-term domestic wholesale borrowing rates,\n\t\t\t\t\twere as low as they had ever been in Australia. There had been some issuance by Australian banks in\n\t\t\t\t\twholesale markets, and a number of foreign banks had raised bonds in the Australian market in April.\n\t\t\t\t\tOverall, Australian banks' needs for additional funding were currently low, since they had strong\n\t\t\t\t\tliquidity and funding positions. Reflecting this, members noted that, to date, there had been modest\n\t\t\t\t\ttake-up of funding from the Bank's Term Funding Facility, which provides low-cost funding at\n\t\t\t\t\t0.25 per cent for a term of three years. However, banks were expected to draw on this\n\t\t\t\t\tfacility to replace more expensive term funding as it matures, which would help to keep funding costs\n\t\t\t\t\tlow.</p>", "<p>Banks had lowered interest rates for business borrowers substantially since mid March, in light of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Bank's policy package as well as government initiatives to support lending to small and\n\t\t\t\t\tmedium-sized businesses. Interest rates for small businesses had declined most and many of these\n\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses had been offered loan payment deferrals for up to six months. Liaison with banks suggested\n\t\t\t\t\tthat around 20 per cent of eligible businesses had taken up this option.</p>", "<p>Members noted that business credit growth had picked up strongly in March. Most of this rise\n\t\t\t\t\treflected larger businesses drawing on existing credit lines, as had been seen in a range of other\n\t\t\t\t\tcountries. It was too early to assess how much of this funding was urgently required or more\n\t\t\t\t\tprecautionary in nature. Several large non-financial corporations had also issued bonds offshore in the\n\t\t\t\t\trecent period. In contrast to larger firms, bank lending to small and medium-sized businesses was\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed. Members noted that loan applications were often taking longer to process, partly\n\t\t\t\t\treflecting administrative delays as financial institutions responded to a high volume of\n\t\t\t\t\tenquiries.</p>", "<p>Banks had also reduced housing interest rates to record lows. Members observed that a large share of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe monetary policy easing since May 2019 had been passed through to variable mortgage rates, and\n\t\t\t\t\tadvertised fixed mortgage rates had declined even further over recent months. Banks had also offered\n\t\t\t\t\thousing borrowers loan payment deferrals for up to six months, with a reported take-up rate of around\n\t\t\t\t\t10 per cent for the largest lenders and somewhat less for smaller lenders. Meanwhile, many\n\t\t\t\t\tother borrowers were maintaining mortgage payments in excess of their required minimum payments.</p>", "<p>The sharp decline in economic activity was expected to dampen the demand for borrowing from\n\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses and households for some time.</p>"], "Financial Stability": ["<p>Members continued their discussion of financial stability issues from the previous meeting, focusing\n\t\t\t\t\ton some particular risks to financial stability that were being monitored closely.</p>", "<p>Internationally, banks were generally in a stronger position than they had been entering the global\n\t\t\t\t\tfinancial crisis, since they now had substantially more capital and liquidity. However, in some\n\t\t\t\t\tjurisdictions, banks had low profits and their large holdings of sovereign debt in their home country\n\t\t\t\t\texposed some of them to concerns about high government debt.</p>", "<p>The preceding seven years had seen a very large increase in the stock of BBB-rated non-financial\n\t\t\t\t\tcorporate debt, which was on the ratings threshold for being considered investment grade. For both\n\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar and euro-denominated debt, BBB-rated debt was around three times the stock of BB and\n\t\t\t\t\tlower-rated debt. Members noted that this debt would fall outside the investment mandates for some\n\t\t\t\t\tasset managers if it were downgraded to sub-investment grade; as a result, downgraded firms could face\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater difficulty rolling over their borrowings. There had also been a very large increase in the\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue of leveraged loans made to less creditworthy corporate borrowers, and a higher share of these\n\t\t\t\t\tloans were ‘covenant-lite’. There had been a sharp decline in the price of these loans as\n\t\t\t\t\ta result of increased risk associated with the global economic contraction.</p>", "<p>Members were briefed on the resilience of Australian households in the current downturn. Around\n\t\t\t\t\tone-third of households with mortgages had prepayment buffers of three years or more. But a smaller\n\t\t\t\t\tshare had no mortgage prepayment buffer and were more susceptible to financial stress. Housing loan\n\t\t\t\t\tarrears were likely to increase, but the extent would depend on the severity of the economic\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraction and the associated increase in unemployment. Loan payment deferrals would reduce the\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease in arrears rates for at least the following six months.</p>", "<p>Members discussed vulnerabilities associated with commercial property, particularly for office and\n\t\t\t\t\tretail property. A large amount of new office space was expected to be completed in Sydney and\n\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne in 2020. Members noted that demand was not expected to keep pace with stronger supply in the\n\t\t\t\t\tnear term and therefore it was likely that vacancy rates would rise and office rents would fall. Rising\n\t\t\t\t\tvacancies and reduced rent would be likely to lead to lower valuations, which would pose challenges for\n\t\t\t\t\tleveraged property investors and developers. Retail property was already experiencing rising vacancies\n\t\t\t\t\tand falling capital values prior to the current downturn. The effect on retail businesses of the social\n\t\t\t\t\tdistancing measures was likely to exacerbate these problems.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members recognised that the global economy was experiencing a\n\t\t\t\t\tvery severe downturn as countries sought to contain the COVID-19 outbreak through restrictions on\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity. Many countries were likely to experience their biggest peace-time economic contractions since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe 1930s and labour markets were very weak. The outlook remained uncertain, although if infection\n\t\t\t\t\trates continued to decline and restrictions were eased, a recovery could be expected to start later in\n\t\t\t\t\t2020, supported by both the large fiscal packages and the monetary policy response.</p>", "<p>The functioning of financial markets had improved over the prior month, although conditions had not\n\t\t\t\t\tcompletely normalised. Credit markets had progressively opened to more firms and long-term bond yields\n\t\t\t\t\tremained at historically low levels.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the very significant economic contraction that was taking place in Australia and the\n\t\t\t\tsubstantial, coordinated and unprecedented fiscal and monetary response. This response was softening the\n\t\t\t\tcontraction and would help support the economic recovery once the health crisis had passed and\n\t\t\t\trestrictions had been removed. It was supporting incomes, maintaining employment relationships,\n\t\t\t\tunderpinning the supply of credit to businesses and households, and keeping borrowing costs low. Members\n\t\t\t\tnoted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, remained\n\t\t\t\tresilient and was helping the economy traverse this difficult period.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the Bank's policy package was working broadly as expected. The package had\n\t\t\t\t\thelped to lower funding costs and stabilise financial conditions, and was supporting the economy. The\n\t\t\t\t\tpackage had also contributed to a significant improvement in the functioning of government bond\n\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, and the 3-year Australian Government bond yield was at the target of around 25 basis\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints. Given these developments, the Bank had scaled back the size and frequency of bond purchases.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank was prepared to scale up these purchases again, if necessary, to achieve the yield target and\n\t\t\t\t\tensure bond markets remain functional. The yield target was expected to remain in place until progress\n\t\t\t\t\twas made towards the goals for full employment and inflation.</p>", "<p>The Bank's daily open market operations were continuing to support credit and maintain low\n\t\t\t\t\tfunding costs in the economy. To assist with the smooth functioning of Australia's capital\n\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, the Board endorsed a proposal to broaden the range of eligible collateral for the Bank's\n\t\t\t\t\tdomestic market operations to include Australian dollar securities issued by non-bank corporations with\n\t\t\t\t\tan investment grade credit rating. This change would bring the treatment of corporate bonds in the\n\t\t\t\t\tBank's collateral framework into close alignment with that of bank debt. It would improve the\n\t\t\t\t\tliquidity characteristics of some corporate bonds, helping to facilitate the smooth functioning of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmarket. The proposed approach was consistent with the collateral frameworks of the major central banks,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich accept corporate paper under repurchase agreements (repos), and it would not have a material\n\t\t\t\t\timpact on the Bank's risk profile. Members noted that the Bank would not be purchasing corporate\n\t\t\t\t\tpaper on an outright basis, but only under repos.</p>", "<p>In the various scenarios for the Australian economy considered by the Board, the labour market was\n\t\t\t\texpected to have ongoing spare capacity, and inflation was expected to be below 2 per cent\n\t\t\t\tover the following few years. Given this outlook, the Board would maintain its efforts to support the\n\t\t\t\teconomy by keeping funding costs low and credit available to households and businesses. As the\n\t\t\t\tBank's policy package had been introduced only recently, members assessed that the best course of\n\t\t\t\taction was to maintain the current policy settings and monitor economic and financial outcomes closely.\n\t\t\t\tThe Board remained committed to supporting jobs, incomes and businesses during this difficult period and\n\t\t\t\tto assisting Australia to be well placed for the expected recovery.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board reaffirmed the elements of the policy package announced on 19 March 2020, namely:</p>", "<p>The Board confirmed that the target for three-year yields would be maintained until progress was made\n\t\t\t\ttowards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would be\n\t\t\t\tappropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself was raised. The Board determined that\n\t\t\t\tit would not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment and it is\n\t\t\t\tconfident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target band.</p>", "<p>To assist with the smooth functioning of Australia's capital markets, the Board endorsed\n\t\t\t\tbroadening the collateral eligible for the Bank's domestic market operations to include debt issued\n\t\t\t\tby non-bank corporations with an investment grade credit rating.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to endnote 1\">[1]</a></sup></p>"]}},

In contrast, a number of emerging market and low-income economies had yet to see\n\t\t\t\t\ta peak in the flow of new cases. Members observed that there continued to be material downside risks to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe global outlook, especially if infection rates were to rise in countries where the epidemic had\n\t\t\t\t\tseemed to be under control, or if concerns about the virus or insufficient policy support were to\n\t\t\t\t\tconstrain spending.</p>", "<p>Measures of core inflation had eased in most advanced economies in April, and lower oil prices had\n\t\t\t\t\talso reduced headline inflation significantly. The effects on prices of the shortfall in global demand\n\t\t\t\t\tand the increase in spare capacity in labour markets had outweighed any boost to prices from\n\t\t\t\t\tdisruptions to supply chains.</p>", "<p>China had been affected by the virus and responded with restrictions earlier than other countries, and\n\t\t\t\twas therefore further into the recovery phase. Industrial production had recovered to be above\n\t\t\t\tpre-outbreak levels and measures of traffic congestion had reached previous levels. In contrast,\n\t\t\t\tconsumer spending and indicators of public transport usage had remained weak, even though most\n\t\t\t\trestrictions on movement had been lifted. Members noted that it was unclear whether this weakness\n\t\t\t\treflected ongoing concerns about the virus, a loss of income during the lockdown or more enduring\n\t\t\t\tbehavioural changes. The Chinese authorities had announced further stimulus measures at the National\n\t\t\t\tPeople's Congress in May, but the scale of the overall stimulus was still expected to be smaller\n\t\t\t\tthan during the global financial crisis.</p>", "<p>Exports from China had also returned to more typical levels by April, but at least some of this\n\t\t\t\trecovery appeared to have reflected exporters catching up with their backlog of orders. External demand\n\t\t\t\twas expected to be weaker in coming months because the pandemic had continued to constrain demand\n\t\t\t\telsewhere in the world. Consistent with weak global demand, business conditions were reported to be weak\n\t\t\t\tin a number of other economies in east Asia, despite the flow of new COVID-19 cases declining to\n\t\t\t\tvery low levels and restrictions in those economies having been eased substantially.</p>", "<p>The major advanced economies had recorded significant contractions in output in the March quarter, even\n\t\t\t\tthough restrictions on activity had been imposed only late in the quarter. More timely data on business\n\t\t\t\tconditions and the movement of people suggested that these economies had been weakest in April and had\n\t\t\t\tstarted to recover in May. Members noted that measures of the movement of people had tended to decline\n\t\t\t\tahead of, or in some cases even without, explicit restrictions being imposed. This suggested that\n\t\t\t\tvoluntary decisions by households and businesses had been an important factor. Exceptional fiscal and\n\t\t\t\tmonetary policy support had been deployed throughout this period and further support was being\n\t\t\t\tconsidered in some of the major advanced economies.</p>", "<p>The contraction in activity in the major advanced economies had been accompanied by a very severe\n\t\t\t\tdeterioration in the labour market. The exact effect on reported unemployment rates had varied widely\n\t\t\t\tacross countries, depending on the severity of restrictions as well as the scope of policies, such as\n\t\t\t\twage and employment subsidy schemes, designed to preserve employment and prevent layoffs; definitional\n\t\t\t\tdifferences regarding whether employees who had been stood down without pay were classified as\n\t\t\t\tunemployed had also had a bearing.</p>", "<p>The number of COVID-19 cases had continued to increase in a number of emerging market economies,\n\t\t\t\tincluding India and Brazil. At the beginning of June, Brazil had the second-highest number of confirmed\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 cases after the United States. In India, the growth momentum had not been strong when the\n\t\t\t\tglobal pandemic was declared, although output had increased in the March quarter. The severe\n\t\t\t\trestrictions put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 had led to sharp declines in activity\n\t\t\t\tin the June quarter and a significant increase in unemployment to 20–25 per cent. Given\n\t\t\t\tthe limited social infrastructure available to support unemployed workers in India, authorities had\n\t\t\t\tbegun to ease restrictions in May, even as the number of new cases continued to increase.</p>", "<p>Consistent with the decline in global demand, prices for energy-related commodities, including oil,\n\t\t\t\tliquefied natural gas and thermal coal, had remained low. In contrast, prices for iron ore had increased\n\t\t\t\tover the prior month, reflecting expectations of increased infrastructure spending in China and\n\t\t\t\telsewhere. Members noted that the increase in iron ore prices had also been driven by supply constraints\n\t\t\t\tin Brazil. Demand for coking coal – another input into steel-making – had not been as\n\t\t\t\tstrong, partly because India's lockdown had reduced an important source of demand for\n\t\t\t\tAustralia's coking coal exports.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["<p>Economic activity in Australia had contracted very significantly in late March and April, but more\n\t\t\t\trecent data had suggested that it had begun to recover over the course of May. The March quarter\n\t\t\t\tnational accounts, which would be released the day after the meeting, were expected to report that\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in output had been slightly negative, which would be a stronger result than in most other\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies.</p>", "<p>While some categories of discretionary household spending had contracted in March, members noted that\n\t\t\t\tthe large increase in retail spending was expected to have partly offset this, in contrast to the\n\t\t\t\texperience of many other countries. Preliminary data indicated that retail sales had since fallen\n\t\t\t\tsharply in April. This was consistent with a range of data sources, including liaison reports, which\n\t\t\t\tsuggested that household spending had declined sharply in April but had recovered somewhat in May.</p>", "<p>The contraction in spending in late March and April had been accompanied by significant job losses,\n\t\t\t\twith total hours worked falling by 9 per cent in April. Timelier payroll data suggested that\n\t\t\t\tthe pace of job losses had slowed towards the end of April. In some of the industries that had been most\n\t\t\t\taffected by the restrictions on activity, the number of jobs had stabilised or increased a little,\n\t\t\t\tsuggesting that the total decline in hours worked may be less than had previously been feared.\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, members noted that, while this was a welcome development, it still constituted a very\n\t\t\t\tsignificant deterioration. Job losses had continued in other industries, which pointed to the\n\t\t\t\tpossibility of a more persistent reduction in overall demand than had previously been expected.\n\t\t\t\tInformation from liaison with firms had highlighted that the pipeline of work was diminishing as firms\n\t\t\t\tdeferred or cancelled investment and new projects, including in construction and business services.\n\t\t\t\tBusiness conditions in April had remained well below average.</p>", "<p>In April, an unusually high proportion of people who had lost their jobs did not actively search for\n\t\t\t\tanother job, so they had been recorded as having left the labour force and, as a result, the\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had increased by less than expected to 6.2 per cent. The share of workers\n\t\t\t\trecorded as being employed but working zero hours had also increased sharply in April; while some of\n\t\t\t\tthese workers were likely to have been supported through the JobKeeper program, others would have been\n\t\t\t\tstood down without pay and may have become unemployed since then.</p>", "<p>While job losses and reduced hours for those still in work had reduced labour income, government\n\t\t\t\tsupport had provided a considerable offset. Households that were already receiving welfare payments had\n\t\t\t\treceived additional payments, and the JobKeeper program and increased JobSeeker payments had supported\n\t\t\t\tincomes for others. In some instances, households had received more income than usual. Lower fuel\n\t\t\t\tprices, free childcare and other initiatives, as well as more limited consumption opportunities during\n\t\t\t\tthe period of restrictions, had also reduced living expenses for many households. The implied increase\n\t\t\t\tin household savings had been consistent with the recent large reductions in personal credit and\n\t\t\t\tincreases in mortgage payments.</p>", "<p>Preliminary indicators suggested that business investment was likely to have been flat in the March\n\t\t\t\tquarter. Data on capital expenditure intentions had pointed to a substantial and broad-based decline in\n\t\t\t\tnon-mining investment over the following year or so. Members noted that uncertainty about how the\n\t\t\t\teconomy would evolve over the remainder of the year had contributed to decisions by businesses to defer\n\t\t\t\tinvestment and was consistent with information from the Bank's liaison program. Members also noted\n\t\t\t\tthat some state governments had been seeking ways to ease planning restrictions to boost investment.\n\t\t\t\tMining firms' investment intentions had been revised down for both <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span>, but the data still\n\t\t\t\tsuggested that mining investment was past its trough.</p>", "<p>Some indicators suggested conditions in established housing markets had stabilised in recent weeks,\n\t\t\t\talthough turnover remained low and housing prices had fallen in some parts of the country. Information\n\t\t\t\tfrom contacts in the Bank's business liaison program had reported that buyer interest in new\n\t\t\t\tdwellings had declined significantly over recent months as uncertainty about incomes and the\n\t\t\t\tavailability of finance had escalated. An increase in the supply of rental properties and the decline in\n\t\t\t\tpopulation growth associated with the closure of borders had contributed to a decline in advertised\n\t\t\t\trents. Some existing renters had also received rent reductions. Members noted that these conditions had\n\t\t\t\tdampened the outlook for dwelling investment once the current pipeline of work had been completed.</p>", "<p>Public demand had grown strongly in the March quarter. Members noted that the Australian Government and\n\t\t\t\tstate governments had committed to higher spending across a range of programs, including the JobKeeper\n\t\t\t\tprogram; these measures were expected to deliver significant support to the economy.</p>"], "International Financial Markets": ["<p>Members noted that financial conditions globally had been broadly stable or eased a little further over\n\t\t\t\tthe preceding month. The improvement in market functioning had allowed a number of central banks to\n\t\t\t\tscale back their purchases of government bonds. The improvement in financial conditions since the acute\n\t\t\t\tmarket strains in March had been consistent with central bank and fiscal policy measures, a decline in\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 infections and the associated easing of restrictions on economic activity. Central banks\n\t\t\t\thad announced a few new measures to ease financial conditions in recent weeks, but had generally shifted\n\t\t\t\ttheir focus to refining existing programs or putting already announced programs into operation. Market\n\t\t\t\tparticipants had not ruled out the prospect of additional monetary policy support in the period ahead,\n\t\t\t\tincluding the possibility of negative policy rates in a number of jurisdictions. However, senior\n\t\t\t\tofficials from the Federal Reserve indicated that they were not considering negative policy rates in the\n\t\t\t\tUnited States, where such policies were likely to be counterproductive. In China, financial conditions\n\t\t\t\tremained supportive, as reflected in the recent pick-up in bank credit growth, assisted by the targeted\n\t\t\t\tpolicies of the People's Bank of China.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the sharp recovery in the prices of risky assets since their lows earlier in the year\n\t\t\t\tand whether this was warranted given the large decline in global economic activity and the highly\n\t\t\t\tuncertain outlook. After falling by over 30 per cent in late February and mid March, major\n\t\t\t\tmarket equity indexes had recovered to be about 10–20 per cent below their recent\n\t\t\t\tpeaks. The ASX 200 had recovered about half of its earlier fall. Market analysts had projected a\n\t\t\t\tmore favourable outlook for earnings than for overall economic activity, and equity prices had been\n\t\t\t\tsupported by lower interest rates. Members noted that various asset purchase programs and backstop\n\t\t\t\tfacilities put in place by central banks, including those of the Federal Reserve, had supported investor\n\t\t\t\tdemand for corporate securities, with investment grade corporate bond yields declining to around\n\t\t\t\tpre-pandemic levels despite record bond issuance. For lower-quality borrowers, corporate funding\n\t\t\t\tconditions remained more challenging.</p>", "<p>In sovereign bond markets, yields had been little changed around historical lows in most major\n\t\t\t\teconomies despite rising issuance as governments borrowed to meet spending commitments. Members noted\n\t\t\t\tthat yield curves in Australia and the United States had broadly similar shapes, being relatively flat\n\t\t\t\tout to three years and upward sloping at longer maturities, although US yields had been lower than those\n\t\t\t\tin Australia. In emerging markets, members noted that conditions in sovereign borrowing markets had\n\t\t\t\timproved a little further, with policy easing by some central banks supporting bond prices in secondary\n\t\t\t\tor primary markets. However, financial conditions remained tighter than prior to the\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak and concerns remained over a number of countries that had external financing\n\t\t\t\tvulnerabilities and/or had struggled to manage the spread of the virus.</p>", "<p>In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had depreciated against most currencies in the recent\n\t\t\t\tperiod. This included most emerging market currencies, although increasing tensions between the United\n\t\t\t\tStates and China had contributed to a depreciation of both the renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar in the\n\t\t\t\tforward market. Members noted that the Australian dollar had appreciated further relative to the\n\t\t\t\tUS dollar and on a trade-weighted basis, to be around levels previously recorded in January. This\n\t\t\t\thad followed the earlier depreciation up to the middle of March, which had been larger than that of most\n\t\t\t\tother advanced economy exchange rates. Movements in the Australian dollar over the course of this year\n\t\t\t\thad been closely correlated with global equity prices. While commodity prices and interest rate\n\t\t\t\tdifferentials between Australia and other advanced economies had increased in the recent period, they\n\t\t\t\thad generally been little changed since earlier in the year.</p>"], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["<p>The package of monetary policy measures implemented by the Bank in mid March had contributed to\n\t\t\t\taccommodative financing conditions in Australia.</p>", "<p>The overnight cash rate had settled over recent weeks at around 13–15 basis points, which\n\t\t\t\twas below the target rate but above the deposit rate of 10 basis points for Exchange Settlement\n\t\t\t\tbalances held at the Bank. This was consistent with large Exchange Settlement balances, which had also\n\t\t\t\treduced activity in the overnight cash market, in line with experience in other countries following\n\t\t\t\tsubstantial increases in central bank balances held by the banking system. On a few days in May,\n\t\t\t\tactivity had been too low to support the publication of a transaction-based cash rate, and the cash rate\n\t\t\t\thad therefore been determined by the Bank using the previously published rate, in line with the\n\t\t\t\tfall-back procedures. Market pricing suggested that market participants were expecting the cash rate to\n\t\t\t\tremain around current levels for some time. Other domestic money market rates were also at low levels.\n\t\t\t\tThe amounts of the Bank's daily repurchase operations had remained well below their heightened\n\t\t\t\tlevels in March, reflecting reduced demand and the high levels of liquidity already in the system.</p>", "<p>The functioning of government bond markets had improved, with bid-offer spreads returning to more\n\t\t\t\ttypical levels. Also, the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds had remained at the target of\n\t\t\t\taround 25 basis points. Accordingly, the Bank had conducted only one auction to purchase bonds\n\t\t\t\tsince the previous meeting, with total purchases to date of around $50 billion. Members noted,\n\t\t\t\thowever, that the yields on bonds with one to two years to maturity had risen to be a few basis points\n\t\t\t\thigher than the yields on three-year bonds. This reflected the lower level of liquidity in these\n\t\t\t\tshort-term bonds and the tendency for demand to taper off when bonds are no longer in the basket for the\n\t\t\t\tthree-year bond futures and as they approach maturity. Should these developments continue, the Bank\n\t\t\t\twould consider purchasing bonds in the secondary market to ensure that these short-term yields are\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with the target for three-year yields. 10-year bond yields had been stable around very low\n\t\t\t\tlevels. These low yields had prevailed despite record issuance volumes, including the syndication by the\n\t\t\t\tAustralian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) of $19 billion of a new 10-year bond, which had\n\t\t\t\tbeen met by very strong demand.</p>", "<p>Members noted that take-up of the Term Funding Facility (TFF) had been increasing gradually, with total\n\t\t\t\tdrawdowns to date of around $6 billion out of a total funding allowance of $135 billion.\n\t\t\t\tStrong growth in deposits had contributed to this gradual take-up. Nevertheless, in liaison, banks had\n\t\t\t\tindicated that they planned to draw upon the TFF in greater volumes over coming months to replace\n\t\t\t\texisting debt as it matures. Bank bond issuance had remained subdued in light of the strong growth in\n\t\t\t\tbank deposits and the option to use the TFF. Bank funding costs were benefiting from record low interest\n\t\t\t\trates on deposits and wholesale funding sources. Issuance of asset-backed securities had resumed in May,\n\t\t\t\tsupported by purchases from the AOFM.</p>", "<p>Activity in business funding markets had increased. Members noted that bond issuance by non-financial\n\t\t\t\tcorporations had picked up, with the Board's decision at the previous meeting to broaden the\n\t\t\t\tBank's collateral arrangements for corporate debt viewed as supportive of the market. The volume of\n\t\t\t\tequity raised had been high as listed companies bolstered the capital position of their balance sheets.\n\t\t\t\tBusiness credit had been little changed in April. This followed the sharp increase in lending to large\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses in March, which to a large extent had reflected precautionary demand by businesses that had\n\t\t\t\tdrawn down their existing lines of credit in the face of economic uncertainty. In a number of cases,\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses had left the funds on deposit at their bank. Members noted that bank lending to small and\n\t\t\t\tmedium-sized businesses had been little changed, reflecting weak demand for credit and a cautious\n\t\t\t\tapproach to lending by some banks. Interest rates on outstanding business loans had declined further in\n\t\t\t\tApril.</p>", "<p>Housing loan payments (which include payments into offset accounts) had increased sharply in April,\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with many borrowers saving for precautionary reasons and the curtailment of opportunities for\n\t\t\t\tspending. These effects appeared to be larger than the effects of deferred loan payments and reductions\n\t\t\t\tin housing loan interest flowing through to borrowers.</p>", "<p>Housing loan commitments (excluding refinancing) had been little changed in recent months, despite\n\t\t\t\t\tthe slowdown in housing market activity. Members discussed that this may reflect the effect of lags in\n\t\t\t\t\tprocessing applications lodged before the adverse effect of the pandemic on housing market activity.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe refinancing of loans remained high as borrowers sought to take advantage of competition among\n\t\t\t\t\tlenders for borrowers with low credit risk. Housing credit extended to owner-occupiers had slowed only\n\t\t\t\t\ta little and growth in credit to owner-occupiers had remained stable over the six months to April. In\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrast, housing credit to investors had declined in April.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members recognised that the global economy was experiencing a\n\t\t\t\t\tsevere downturn as countries sought to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Labour markets had\n\t\t\t\t\tdeteriorated significantly and there had been a sharp rise in unemployment in some economies. Over the\n\t\t\t\t\tpreceding month, infection rates had declined in many countries and there had been some easing of\n\t\t\t\t\trestrictions on activity. If this were to continue, a recovery in the global economy could be expected\n\t\t\t\t\tto continue, supported by both the large fiscal packages and the significant easing in monetary\n\t\t\t\t\tpolicies.</p>", "<p>Members recognised that the Australian economy was experiencing the biggest economic contraction\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the 1930s. A very large number of people had lost their jobs or were working zero hours,\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold spending had weakened considerably and some investment was being deferred or had been\n\t\t\t\t\tcancelled. Notwithstanding these developments, it was possible that the downturn would be shallower\n\t\t\t\t\tthan earlier expected. The rate of new infections had declined significantly and some restrictions had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen eased earlier than had previously been thought likely. However, the outlook remained highly\n\t\t\t\t\tuncertain and the pandemic was likely to have long-lasting effects on the economy.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the Bank's policy package was working broadly as expected. The package had\n\t\t\t\t\thelped to lower funding costs and stabilise financial conditions, and was supporting the economy. The\n\t\t\t\t\tpackage had also contributed to a significant improvement in the functioning of government bond\n\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, and the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds was at the target of around 25 basis\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints. Given these developments, the Bank had purchased government bonds on only one occasion since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe previous meeting, although it was prepared to scale up these purchases again, if necessary, to\n\t\t\t\t\tachieve the yield target and ensure bond markets remain functional. The yield target was expected to\n\t\t\t\t\tremain in place until progress was made towards the goals for full employment and inflation.</p>", "<p>The Board recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and\n\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy in Australia was helping the economy through this difficult period. It was likely that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis fiscal and monetary support would be required for some time. The Board remained committed to\n\t\t\t\t\tsupporting jobs, incomes and businesses and to making sure that Australia is well placed for recovery.\n\t\t\t\t\tIts actions were keeping funding costs low and supporting the supply of credit to households and\n\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses.

However, the number of new COVID-19 cases was rising rapidly in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome countries, notably the United States and some emerging market economies. Restrictions had been\n\t\t\t\t\teased in some countries despite new COVID-19 cases increasing or remaining at high levels. Given\n\t\t\t\t\tthese developments, risks to the outlook for the world economy had increased recently despite the\n\t\t\t\t\teconomic data having been on an improving path over the preceding couple of months as restrictions had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen eased. Members noted that the sustainability of the economic recovery would depend in large part\n\t\t\t\t\ton health outcomes and ongoing policy support.</p>", "<p>GDP for the March quarter had contracted sharply in a number of countries. The severity of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraction reflected the timing of the lockdown in each country, its intensity and the types of\n\t\t\t\t\tindustries and activities that had been locked down. The decline in activity in the services sector had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen particularly pronounced across countries.</p>", "<p>Members noted that survey measures of business conditions had improved in June across several\n\t\t\t\t\teconomies. Activity in the services sector had recovered more than manufacturing in June, but generally\n\t\t\t\t\tremained weak. The recovery in business conditions appeared to have been strongest in the United States\n\t\t\t\t\tand China.</p>", "<p>A range of indicators pointed to economic conditions continuing to normalise in China. Industrial\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity and most property-related activity had returned to levels prevailing prior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak. However, consumer spending and travel-related activity remained well below\n\t\t\t\t\ttypical levels. In India, employment had recovered strongly, alongside an increase in new\n\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 cases. In general, high-frequency indicators in India suggested that people were\n\t\t\t\t\trestricting all but essential travel.</p>", "<p>Members observed that household consumption in the June quarter was likely to have been very weak\n\t\t\t\t\tglobally. Consumers had been substituting away from services in favour of goods, and from international\n\t\t\t\t\tservices to domestic retail goods, in particular. In advanced economies, retail sales values in May had\n\t\t\t\t\trecovered most or all of the decline in April; in China, retail sales had been recovering since\n\t\t\t\t\tnationwide restrictions were lifted in February.</p>", "<p>The contraction in activity in the global economy had been accompanied by a very severe deterioration\n\t\t\t\t\tin labour market conditions. Members noted that government policies were offering substantial support\n\t\t\t\t\tto labour markets around the world. A large share of the labour force in advanced economies was\n\t\t\t\t\tsupported by wage subsidy programs. Maintaining workers' attachment to their employers was\n\t\t\t\t\tpreventing a large increase in measured unemployment. Government support measures were also helping to\n\t\t\t\t\tsustain household incomes. In the United States, aggregate household income had increased in recent\n\t\t\t\t\tmonths, in part owing to increases in unemployment insurance, which had raised the incomes of many\n\t\t\t\t\tunemployed people. Definitional differences had contributed to wide cross-country variation in recorded\n\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rates. For instance, in the United States the unemployment rate had risen most and then\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclined fastest because people who were temporarily stood down (and immediately classified as\n\t\t\t\t\tunemployed) had more recently returned to work.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["<p>Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that economic conditions in Australia had weakened\n\t\t\t\tsignificantly since the start of the year, but the downturn had been less severe than feared a few\n\t\t\t\tmonths earlier. Consumer spending in May and June had been stronger than expected, and had also held up\n\t\t\t\tbetter than in most other countries. Manufacturing and construction activity had also been less affected\n\t\t\t\tin Australia than elsewhere. Similarly, the contraction in the labour market had been less severe than\n\t\t\t\texpected in May. Nevertheless, the shock to the Australian economy would be the most severe since the\n\t\t\t\t1930s, and the outlook remained highly uncertain as it depended in large part upon containment of the\n\t\t\t\tpandemic.</p>", "<p>Household consumption had declined by around 1 per cent in the March quarter, and was\n\t\t\t\texpected to have contracted considerably more sharply in the June quarter. Reduced spending on\n\t\t\t\tinternational travel was likely to account for a material share of the fall in household consumption.\n\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the restrictions imposed had also significantly dampened non-retail consumption,\n\t\t\t\tincluding of personal services, in the June quarter. While consumption of services, especially\n\t\t\t\tdiscretionary services, had been weak since March, the value of retail sales, which accounts for\n\t\t\t\tone-third of consumption, was higher in May than levels before the COVID-19 outbreak. This partly\n\t\t\t\treflected substitution away from services where restrictions were applied in favour of goods such as\n\t\t\t\tfood, household items and recreational items. Vehicle sales had also picked up markedly in June, after\n\t\t\t\thaving fallen considerably in April. Across the states, growth in retail spending had been most subdued\n\t\t\t\tin Victoria; states where numbers of active COVID-19 cases were very low had seen larger increases\n\t\t\t\tin retail sales.</p>", "<p>Imports and exports had both been lower in May, leaving the trade surplus broadly unchanged at a\n\t\t\t\thistorically high level. The decline in imports had been broadly based and consistent with weakness in\n\t\t\t\toverall consumption. While exports of resources had declined only marginally, members observed that the\n\t\t\t\tvalue of services exports had contracted sharply in recent months, with travel exports nearly halving in\n\t\t\t\tvalue and transport service exports also declining. Around two-thirds of travel service exports are\n\t\t\t\teducation-related, including the tuition and living expenses of international students, with tourism\n\t\t\t\taccounting for the remaining third. It was noted that the full effect of the closure of Australia's\n\t\t\t\tinternational borders would be evident in the June quarter rather than the March quarter. Meanwhile,\n\t\t\t\tconsumer and business confidence, and surveys of business conditions, had picked up as restrictions on\n\t\t\t\tactivity were eased.</p>", "<p>Members noted that fiscal policy was playing a key role in supporting economic activity and the labour\n\t\t\t\tmarket in Australia and elsewhere. Domestically and abroad, this policy support had included direct\n\t\t\t\tpayments to households and businesses, increased spending on health services, wage subsidies and loan\n\t\t\t\tguarantees. In Australia, government assistance – particularly the JobKeeper and JobSeeker\n\t\t\t\tprograms – was playing an important role in supporting household incomes and consumption.\n\t\t\t\tMortgage payment forbearance, rental reductions and withdrawals from superannuation balances had also\n\t\t\t\tsupported household cash flows in the June quarter and into the September quarter. Superannuation\n\t\t\t\twithdrawals had been significant, equivalent to around 6 per cent of quarterly household\n\t\t\t\tincome, with more than 3 million requests filed to date.</p>", "<p>Conditions in the labour market had been very weak, but not as severe as expected a few months earlier.\n\t\t\t\tAnother large decline in employment in May had brought the number of people who had lost their job over\n\t\t\t\ttwo months to 835,000. The unemployment rate had risen by 0.7 percentage points to\n\t\t\t\t7.1 per cent in May. As had been the case in April, an unusually large share of people who\n\t\t\t\tleft employment in May did not actively search for work and were therefore recorded as having exited the\n\t\t\t\tlabour force. Members noted that the employment-to-population ratio and the participation rate had both\n\t\t\t\tfallen significantly and were at their lowest levels in many years. Underemployment had eased in May,\n\t\t\t\talbeit from a very high level, as more people resumed working longer hours. As with employment, total\n\t\t\t\thours worked declined again in May but by less than in April. The peak-to-trough decline in total hours\n\t\t\t\tworked was now expected to be closer to 10 per cent than the 20 per cent decline\n\t\t\t\texpected earlier. Payroll data indicated that job losses were reversing gradually in those industries\n\t\t\t\tmost directly affected by the restrictions on activity, such as accommodation, cafes and restaurants.\n\t\t\t\tJobs in other industries that had also been affected, such as business services, had yet to recover\n\t\t\t\tmaterially. Payroll data also suggested that the worst of the job losses was likely to have passed.</p>", "<p>Members noted that conditions in the established housing market remained mixed. Housing prices in some\n\t\t\t\tlarger cities had declined in June, though were only a little below recent peaks in the case of Sydney\n\t\t\t\tand Melbourne. Housing prices in a number of smaller cities were broadly unchanged. Housing turnover\n\t\t\t\tdeclined significantly when in-person auctions and open homes were banned owing to physical distancing\n\t\t\t\trestrictions, but as these were lifted turnover had recovered somewhat. Conditions in the rental market\n\t\t\t\tremained weak, partly reflecting an increase in the supply of rental housing in some areas. The reduced\n\t\t\t\tflow of new arrivals to Australia was also affecting some markets. Rental vacancy rates had increased\n\t\t\t\tsharply in Melbourne and Sydney to just above 4 per cent. Soft conditions in the rental market\n\t\t\t\twere expected to weigh on rent inflation for some time.</p>", "<p>Investment activity in the residential and non-mining business sectors had been subdued and was\n\t\t\t\texpected to remain so for some time. Members noted that uncertainty about job losses had affected the\n\t\t\t\tdemand for new housing, and building approvals had declined, particularly for apartments. Liaison\n\t\t\t\tcontacts had indicated that the recently announced HomeBuilder package had provided a boost to buyer\n\t\t\t\tinterest in the detached housing market, but less so for apartments. Non-mining business investment had\n\t\t\t\tbeen weak prior to the onset of the pandemic, and indications from liaison contacts suggested it would\n\t\t\t\tweaken further in the period ahead. Uncertainty about the future path of the pandemic, associated\n\t\t\t\tcontainment measures and the strength of the economy was significantly affecting investment plans.\n\t\t\t\tNon-essential investment spending was most at risk of a sharp pullback. While the turning point in\n\t\t\t\tmining investment was now evident, overall business investment was expected to remain weak in the period\n\t\t\t\tahead.</p>"], "International Financial Markets": ["<p>Members noted that global financial conditions had remained accommodative amid substantial policy\n\t\t\t\t\tstimulus. Government bond yields had remained around historic lows in many economies, including\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralia. This was partly because monetary policies were expected to remain stimulatory for some\n\t\t\t\t\tyears, and occurred notwithstanding a sharp rise in sovereign debt issuance. Sovereign bond spreads in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe euro area remained low.</p>", "<p>Members of the Federal Open Market Committee had signalled that they expected the policy interest rate\n\t\t\t\twould remain very low until at least 2022 and that they would consider new easing measures, if required.\n\t\t\t\tSenior Federal Reserve officials had stated that negative interest rates were unlikely to be an\n\t\t\t\tappropriate policy tool in the United States. The European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swedish\n\t\t\t\tRiksbank had all extended their programs to purchase sovereign and/or private sector assets in June.\n\t\t\t\tMany central banks had also refined the various measures they had introduced to provide support for\n\t\t\t\tcredit, particularly for the business sector. Members observed that, at the same time, central banks had\n\t\t\t\tcontinued to scale back their operations to support the functioning of financial markets because trading\n\t\t\t\tconditions had largely normalised.</p>", "<p>Funding conditions for corporations had remained favourable for most borrowers, particularly those that\n\t\t\t\twere highly rated. Corporate bond spreads had narrowed a little further, notwithstanding record issuance\n\t\t\t\tin the United States and the euro area in the June quarter. Members noted that equity prices in major\n\t\t\t\tmarkets had recovered much of their decline earlier in the year, suggesting that market participants\n\t\t\t\twere generally expecting a short-lived decline in earnings. However, volatility in equity markets had\n\t\t\t\tpicked up more recently, partly reflecting uncertainty associated with the increasing spread of the\n\t\t\t\tvirus in much of the United States and a number of large emerging market economies. In Australia, equity\n\t\t\t\tprices had retraced around half of their earlier decline.</p>", "<p>Improved risk sentiment and the extent of policy easing by the Federal Reserve had seen the\n\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar depreciate against the currencies of most economies over recent months. Members observed\n\t\t\t\t\tthat a wide range of advanced economy currencies had returned to levels previously seen prior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tonset of the pandemic. This was also the case for the Australian dollar, consistent with commodity\n\t\t\t\t\tprices and interest differentials having been little changed over that period.</p>", "<p>In China, authorities had remained cautious about injecting further monetary stimulus amid concerns\n\t\t\t\t\tabout risk-taking in some parts of the financial system. Nonetheless, the authorities had continued to\n\t\t\t\t\tencourage banks to lend to businesses, particularly small enterprises, and the growth rate of overall\n\t\t\t\t\tfinancing had risen over recent months.</p>"], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["<p>Funding costs for Australian banks had been at historic lows and the banks had ample access to\n\t\t\t\t\tfunding. The larger banks had continued to indicate that they would draw on the TFF in time as other\n\t\t\t\t\tfunding matured. Given ample funding from other sources, these banks had not needed to issue senior\n\t\t\t\t\tunsecured bonds this year. These bonds were also more expensive than the option of obtaining funding\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough the TFF. Money market rates and rates on deposits had declined to low levels.</p>", "<p>Members noted that interest rates on business loans had declined to historically low levels. Large\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses had drawn on revolving credit facilities earlier in the year to bolster their liquidity\n\t\t\t\tpositions, but had since repaid some of those funds. Lending to small and medium-sized enterprises\n\t\t\t\t(SMEs) had remained little changed over the preceding year or more. While the supply of business credit\n\t\t\t\tappeared to have tightened, demand for new loans from SMEs had been low given the uncertain outlook and\n\t\t\t\tthat other policy initiatives had provided businesses with a source of funds.</p>", "<p>Large businesses had continued to tap capital markets, particularly by raising new equity. Members\n\t\t\t\tobserved that listed companies in Australia had raised more equity as a proportion of the overall size\n\t\t\t\tof the market than had been seen in markets such as the United Kingdom and United States. Equity\n\t\t\t\traisings in Australia had been more common than debt raisings, while the opposite had been true\n\t\t\t\telsewhere, in particular the United States and the euro area. An important factor explaining this\n\t\t\t\tdifference was that the market for Australian corporate debt is smaller and less liquid than for\n\t\t\t\tcompanies in other jurisdictions.</p>", "<p>Interest rates on Australian housing loans had declined to historically low levels. Around half of the\n\t\t\t\tdecline in the cash rate since February had been passed through to variable mortgage rates. Members\n\t\t\t\tnoted that refinancing activity had risen sharply as borrowers had taken advantage of lower rates and\n\t\t\t\tthe strong competition for lower-risk borrowers. Interest rates on new fixed-rate mortgages were\n\t\t\t\tnoticeably lower than on new variable rate mortgages, which had led to an increasing share of new or\n\t\t\t\trefinanced loans on fixed rates. While some existing borrowers had deferred their loan payments,\n\t\t\t\tpayments into offset accounts had remained high. This was consistent with many home loan borrowers\n\t\t\t\tsaving for precautionary reasons and having reduced opportunities for spending.</p>", "<p>Housing credit extended to owner-occupiers had continued to grow steadily at around the pace of\n\t\t\t\t\tpreceding months, while housing credit to investors had continued to contract. Housing credit growth\n\t\t\t\t\toverall was likely to slow in the months ahead, with commitments for new housing loans having fallen\n\t\t\t\t\tsharply in May. Members noted that this was consistent with weak economic conditions and the soft\n\t\t\t\t\toutlook for the housing market.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>Members began their discussion by reviewing the monetary policy measures that have been used in other\n\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies and their applicability to Australia.</p>", "<p>Members discussed how the elements of the Bank's March policy package could have been configured\n\t\t\t\tdifferently, noting that there has been variation across countries in the design of these measures. It\n\t\t\t\twould have been possible, for example, to set lower, but still positive, interest rate targets and to\n\t\t\t\thave purchased a quantity of government bonds above that necessary to achieve the bond yield target.\n\t\t\t\tMembers also recognised that there was variation across countries in the design of term funding\n\t\t\t\tfacilities and the range of collateral accepted in open market operations.</p>", "<p>After reviewing experience both overseas and in Australia, members agreed that there was no need to\n\t\t\t\tadjust the package of measures in Australia in the current environment. Members agreed, however, to\n\t\t\t\tcontinue to assess the evolving situation in Australia and did not rule out adjusting the current\n\t\t\t\tpackage if circumstances warranted.</p>", "<p>Members also reviewed the international experience with other monetary policies and their relevance in\n\t\t\t\tthe Australian context, as they had done the previous year. These policies included negative interest\n\t\t\t\trates, foreign exchange intervention, the purchase of private sector assets and also direct government\n\t\t\t\tfinancing.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the considerations around these options, which had been covered in a <a href=\"/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-11-26.html\">speech</a> by the Governor in November 2019, remained\n\t\t\t\trelevant in current circumstances. All such options entail significant costs and involve very difficult\n\t\t\t\ttrade-offs and, for some policies, there are legitimate questions about their effectiveness. Members\n\t\t\t\tagreed that negative interest rates in Australia remain extraordinarily unlikely. They also agreed there\n\t\t\t\tis no case for intervention in the foreign exchange market, given its limited effectiveness when the\n\t\t\t\texchange rate is broadly aligned with its fundamental determinants, as at present. Members reaffirmed\n\t\t\t\tthe importance of the longstanding principle of separating monetary policy from the financing of\n\t\t\t\tgovernment, a principle that has served Australia well in practice. Members saw merit in these policy\n\t\t\t\tmatters being addressed in an upcoming speech by the Governor on 21 July.</p>", "<p>In considering this month's decision, members recognised that the global economy was\n\t\t\t\t\texperiencing a severe downturn as countries sought to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Labour\n\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had deteriorated and there had been a sharp rise in unemployment in many economies.\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, timely indicators of economic activity had generally picked up, suggesting that the worst\n\t\t\t\t\tof the global economic contraction had passed. However, the outlook remained uncertain and would depend\n\t\t\t\t\tupon containment of the virus. Over the preceding month, infection rates had declined in some\n\t\t\t\t\tcountries, but they were still very high and rising in other countries.</p>", "<p>Members recognised that the Australian economy was experiencing the biggest economic contraction since\n\t\t\t\tthe 1930s. A very large number of people had lost their jobs, with many others retaining their jobs over\n\t\t\t\tthis period only because of government support programs. Nevertheless, economic conditions had\n\t\t\t\tstabilised and the downturn had been less severe than earlier expected. There had been a pick-up in\n\t\t\t\tconsumer spending in response to the decline in infections and the easing of restrictions across most of\n\t\t\t\tthe country. However, the nature and speed of the economic recovery remained highly uncertain and, as in\n\t\t\t\tother countries, would depend in large part upon the containment of the virus. Uncertainty about the\n\t\t\t\tfuture path of the economy as well as the health situation was continuing to affect the consumption and\n\t\t\t\tinvestment plans of many households and businesses.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the Bank's policy package was continuing to work broadly as expected. The\n\t\t\t\t\tpackage had helped to lower funding costs and stabilise financial conditions, and was supporting the\n\t\t\t\t\teconomy. Government bond markets were operating effectively and the yield on 3-year Australian\n\t\t\t\t\tGovernment bonds remained at the target of around 25 basis points. Given these developments, the\n\t\t\t\t\tBank had not purchased government bonds for some time, although it was prepared to scale up these\n\t\t\t\t\tpurchases again, if necessary, to achieve the yield target and ensure bond markets remain\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctional.</p>", "<p>The Board recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and\n\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy in Australia was helping the economy through this difficult period. It was likely that\n\t\t\t\t\tfiscal and monetary support would be required for some time. The Board remained committed to supporting\n\t\t\t\t\tjobs, incomes and businesses and to making sure that Australia is well placed for recovery. Its actions\n\t\t\t\t\twere keeping funding costs low and supporting the supply of credit to households and businesses.

Case numbers were high in the United States and in\n\t\t\t\tseveral large emerging market economies. Some countries that had brought case numbers down to low\n\t\t\t\tlevels, such as Japan and Australia, had experienced fresh outbreaks in July. In South Korea and much of\n\t\t\t\tEurope there had been more success in suppressing the virus after restrictions on activity had been\n\t\t\t\tlifted. Activity had picked up over the preceding few months, but signs of a reversal in mobility\n\t\t\t\tindicators were emerging in some countries, particularly those with rising infection rates. Members\n\t\t\t\tnoted that the global economy was likely to take longer to recover than initially thought and that the\n\t\t\t\tdamage to labour markets could linger.</p>", "<p>The global downturn in the first half of 2020 was more severe and widespread than had been seen for\n\t\t\t\tmany decades. The extent of the contraction in each economy depended largely on the timing and scale of\n\t\t\t\tlockdowns and other health-related restrictions on activity. The contraction in activity in the March\n\t\t\t\tquarter in advanced economies was not quite as large as had been feared, other than for some euro area\n\t\t\t\teconomies. In the United States and Germany, GDP growth had contracted by around 10 per cent\n\t\t\t\tin the June quarter, while countries that had successfully implemented targeted measures, such as South\n\t\t\t\tKorea, had experienced smaller contractions in activity over the same period.</p>", "<p>Members observed that business conditions in several large economies had improved in June and that this\n\t\t\t\tseemed to have extended into July. Surveyed conditions in the services sector, which had been very badly\n\t\t\t\taffected during the lockdowns, had rebounded particularly strongly. Another feature of the recovery in\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies had been the sharp increases in retail sales. Households had resumed spending, in\n\t\t\t\tsome cases quite rapidly, after the end of restrictions. Household income support had contributed to\n\t\t\t\tthis. By contrast, industrial production had been much slower to recover. The more subdued recovery in\n\t\t\t\tindustrial production may have reflected a combination of lower expectations about future demand as well\n\t\t\t\tas supply chain disruptions.</p>", "<p>Labour markets everywhere had been severely affected by the pandemic. Unemployment had risen and hours\n\t\t\t\tworked had declined. Some countries, such as the United States and Canada, had initially seen very large\n\t\t\t\tdeclines in the employment-to-population ratio, which partly reflected workers who had been temporarily\n\t\t\t\tstood down being counted as unemployed.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the Chinese economy had recovered strongly, and by more than generally expected, in\n\t\t\t\tthe June quarter. Steel-intensive sectors were generating levels of output around or above pre-outbreak\n\t\t\t\tlevels, which was supporting Australia's exports of bulk commodities. Fiscal and monetary policy\n\t\t\t\teasing in China had also been supporting the recovery. In contrast with advanced economies, consumer\n\t\t\t\tspending in China had been slower to recover than industrial production. This may have partly reflected\n\t\t\t\tthe different emphasis of fiscal policy support measures in China, which had been aimed more directly at\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses and less at households compared with advanced economies. However, it was noted that weak\n\t\t\t\tglobal demand could hamper the recovery in export-oriented manufacturing, both in China and elsewhere in\n\t\t\t\teast Asia.</p>", "<p>In India, a partial recovery in employment had been evident in migrant workers returning to their home\n\t\t\t\tvillages and obtaining work in the government's rural work guarantee programs. However, the\n\t\t\t\trecovery in mobility indicators had slowed recently.</p>", "<p>More generally, members noted that a key lesson from the recent international experience is that many\n\t\t\t\tpeople voluntarily restrict their movement if they are concerned about the coronavirus, even in the\n\t\t\t\tabsence of physical distancing restrictions.</p>", "<p>In summarising the international outlook, members noted that the GDP of Australia's major trading\n\t\t\t\tpartners was expected to contract by around 3 per cent in 2020, before rising by around\n\t\t\t\t6 per cent in 2021, leaving GDP below where it would have been had the outbreak not occurred.\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, members agreed that the outlook was highly uncertain, and that the shape of the recovery\n\t\t\t\tdepended on containment of the virus.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion by noting that the economic downturn in Australia over the first\n\t\t\t\thalf of 2020 was the most severe in many decades: staff estimates suggested a decline in GDP of around\n\t\t\t\t7 per cent and a contraction in hours worked of around 10 per cent. Though very\n\t\t\t\tlarge, the downturn in the first half of the year had been smaller than predicted a few months earlier\n\t\t\t\tbecause restrictions had been less onerous and had been lifted earlier than expected. This had allowed\n\t\t\t\tan economic recovery to commence in May. Unprecedented fiscal and monetary support had also played a key\n\t\t\t\trole.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the lengthening and tightening of restrictions in Melbourne, and the extension of\n\t\t\t\trestrictions to regional Victoria, was a setback to the recovery and would weigh on overall domestic\n\t\t\t\tactivity in the September quarter. In addition to the direct effects of the lockdown, there were likely\n\t\t\t\tto be negative effects on the confidence of households and businesses. General uncertainty was noted as\n\t\t\t\taffecting demand more broadly, beyond the industries or states most affected by the earlier restrictions\n\t\t\t\ton activity. Mobility indicators suggested that the previous recovery in activity had slowed across the\n\t\t\t\tcountry, including beyond Melbourne.</p>", "<p>Members considered three scenarios for the economic outlook, given the high degree of uncertainty. The\n\t\t\t\tbaseline scenario assumed that the Stage 4 restrictions in Victoria were not materially extended\n\t\t\t\tand that Australia's international borders remained closed until mid 2021. In this scenario,\n\t\t\t\tthe recovery over the second half of 2020 was forecast to be more gradual than envisaged three months\n\t\t\t\tearlier. This was partly because of the reinstated lockdown in Melbourne, and partly because uncertainty\n\t\t\t\thad been affecting demand beyond the industries most affected by the Stage 3 restrictions on\n\t\t\t\tactivity. In this scenario, output was expected to recover somewhat over the second half of the year,\n\t\t\t\tbringing the contraction over 2020 to 6 per cent. Output was then expected to expand by\n\t\t\t\t5 per cent over 2021 and 4 per cent over 2022. These projections indicated that, by\n\t\t\t\tthe end of the forecast period, GDP was expected to remain short of the level forecast before the\n\t\t\t\tpandemic.</p>", "<p>The two other scenarios – an upside and a downside scenario – differed primarily in terms\n\t\t\t\tof assumptions over the evolution of the coronavirus. The upside scenario embodied a stronger and faster\n\t\t\t\trecovery on the basis of rapid progress in containing the virus in Australia, with no further extension\n\t\t\t\tto the Melbourne lockdown and progressive easing of restrictions nationwide after that. In this\n\t\t\t\tscenario, the faster pace of recovery was driven by restored confidence, which would encourage stronger\n\t\t\t\tconsumption and the recent run-up in savings being unwound at a faster pace than assumed in the baseline\n\t\t\t\tscenario. Much of the near-term decline in GDP would reverse over 2020-21 as consumption growth\n\t\t\t\trebounded strongly in this scenario.</p>", "<p>The downside scenario assumed a globally widespread resurgence in infections in the near term and that\n\t\t\t\tAustralia was faced with periodic outbreaks and ‘rolling’ lockdowns. In this scenario,\n\t\t\t\tconsumption would fall further over the second half of 2020, despite ongoing policy support. With border\n\t\t\t\trestrictions remaining in place until the end of 2021, the recovery in services exports would be\n\t\t\t\tdelayed. As a result, GDP would not recover over the second half of 2020 and the subsequent recovery\n\t\t\t\twould be slower, partly because of the damage to confidence (in addition to the direct effects of more\n\t\t\t\tlockdowns). This would affect consumption and investment even after restrictions were lifted. Members\n\t\t\t\tnoted that the downside scenario entailed a much larger deviation in output from the baseline compared\n\t\t\t\twith the upside scenario, reflecting that the risks around the outlook were to the downside.</p>", "<p>In their discussion of the forecasts, members noted that in previous downturns it had been quite\n\t\t\t\tunusual for consumption to decline significantly, as had been the case in this episode. Despite that, in\n\t\t\t\tthe present episode consumption by households was likely to have rebounded sooner and by more than\n\t\t\t\texpected a few months earlier. This was partly because restrictions on activity had been lifted faster\n\t\t\t\tthan previously anticipated, which translated into a decline in hours worked that was less severe than\n\t\t\t\texpected. But it also reflected the substantial policy support for household income, which, unusually\n\t\t\t\tfor a downturn, had seen incomes for some households rise noticeably. Household cash flow had also been\n\t\t\t\tbolstered by the significant volume of superannuation withdrawals. As a result, with income holding up\n\t\t\t\tand consumption having declined sharply early in the June quarter, the household saving ratio was\n\t\t\t\testimated to have increased substantially.</p>", "<p>The extension of government policy support would continue to support household incomes and assist the\n\t\t\t\trecovery over the following few quarters. While household income was expected to decline for a period\n\t\t\t\twhen this support was tapered, consumption would continue to be supported by higher savings, which would\n\t\t\t\tassist in smoothing consumption through temporary dips in income in the period ahead.</p>", "<p>In considering the substantial amount of fiscal policy support, members noted that around\n\t\t\t\t30 per cent of Australia's working-age population was receiving JobKeeper, JobSeeker or\n\t\t\t\tan equivalent payment. The JobKeeper program had been extended to March 2021, with tighter eligibility\n\t\t\t\trequirements and lower, tiered payments for full-time and part-time workers. The Coronavirus Supplement,\n\t\t\t\tpaid to JobSeeker recipients, had also been extended at a lower rate from September. Combined with other\n\t\t\t\tmeasures and the usual automatic stabilisers, the net positive fiscal impact from the expected change in\n\t\t\t\tAustralian Government finances was equivalent to around 4 per cent of GDP in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span> and a further 5 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span>. State governments had also provided some support, mostly in the form of\n\t\t\t\tincreased funding for public services and relief from taxes and fees.</p>", "<p>In turning to housing activity, members noted that prices in the established housing market had\n\t\t\t\tdeclined moderately in Sydney, Perth and Brisbane, and a little more in Melbourne. New property listings\n\t\t\t\thad recovered to around similar levels in the previous year; however, the reimposition of restrictions\n\t\t\t\tin Melbourne was limiting sales there and would continue to do so. New housing sales were more buoyant,\n\t\t\t\tsupported in part by the national HomeBuilder program and, in the case of Western Australia, substantial\n\t\t\t\tstate grants for new dwelling construction. By contrast, rental markets remained particularly weak\n\t\t\t\tacross the country. This was partly a result of lower demand and the boost to supply from properties\n\t\t\t\tthat were previously rented to international visitors.</p>", "<p>Information from liaison with businesses and recent surveys indicated that the weakness in non-mining\n\t\t\t\tbusiness investment over recent quarters would become more pronounced in the period ahead. Investment in\n\t\t\t\tmachinery and equipment was expected to have been particularly weak in recent months given its\n\t\t\t\tdiscretionary nature. Business liaison had reported that firms were prioritising their liquidity\n\t\t\t\tpositions in response to uncertainty about future demand. Many non-residential building projects that\n\t\t\t\thad not yet commenced were on hold in part because of the uncertainty about future demand for such\n\t\t\t\tspace. Work on projects that had already commenced was also expected to fall in the near term because of\n\t\t\t\tlimits on worker numbers at construction sites in Melbourne. Mining investment was expected to increase\n\t\t\t\tin the near term, but then ease as some projects were deferred.</p>", "<p>With international borders expected to remain closed for six months longer than assumed in May, the\n\t\t\t\toutlook for services exports had been revised down. The profile for education exports was relatively\n\t\t\t\tflat, and other travel-related services exports were not expected to recover until later in 2021; even\n\t\t\t\tthen, they would do so only gradually. The outlook for other exports had been revised a little lower\n\t\t\t\tcompared with the forecast in May, reflecting weak global demand, heightened restrictions in Melbourne\n\t\t\t\tand the recent exchange rate appreciation. The main exception was rural exports, which had been revised\n\t\t\t\ta little higher because of favourable weather. Imports had also been revised lower, reflecting in part\n\t\t\t\tthe effect on outbound tourism of longer border closures.</p>", "<p>Turning to the labour market, employment had been recovering since May, but weekly payroll data showed\n\t\t\t\tthat there was a loss of momentum in late June and the first half of July. This was most evident in\n\t\t\t\tVictoria, but could also be seen across the other states. Members noted that female workers had been\n\t\t\t\taffected disproportionately in the early phase of the contraction. This pattern reflected industry\n\t\t\t\temployment trends, where female workers were disproportionately represented in industries most affected\n\t\t\t\tin the early phase of the restrictions. However, male workers had been more heavily represented in\n\t\t\t\tindustries that had shed jobs in the recent period.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the contraction in hours worked had been less severe than initially thought.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, relative to earlier expectations, more of the fall in hours worked had reflected job losses\n\t\t\t\trather than people working reduced hours. This was despite one in ten workers continuing to be employed\n\t\t\t\ton reduced hours and a large number of full-time workers continuing to be stood down on zero hours. This\n\t\t\t\tsuggested that the contraction in activity and employment was the result of expected weakness in demand\n\t\t\t\tand general uncertainty, in addition to restrictions on activity. It also indicated the recovery in\n\t\t\t\temployment would be slower than earlier assumed.</p>", "<p>More broadly, significant spare capacity in the labour market was constraining wages growth; ahead of\n\t\t\t\tthe pandemic, wages growth had been around 2 per cent. Information from the Bank's\n\t\t\t\tliaison program indicated that the share of contacts expecting to freeze wages or to implement temporary\n\t\t\t\twage cuts was higher than in the past.</p>", "<p>In the baseline scenario, the unemployment rate, which had risen from just over 5 per cent\n\t\t\t\tbefore the pandemic to 7.4 per cent in June, was expected to rise to around\n\t\t\t\t10 per cent in late 2020 before declining gradually to around 7 per cent in 2022.\n\t\t\t\tThe upward trajectory for the unemployment rate reflected moderate employment losses in the second half\n\t\t\t\tof 2020 and an increase in the number of people re-joining the labour force. This followed a period\n\t\t\t\tearlier in the year when an unusually large number of people who lost employment had left the labour\n\t\t\t\tforce altogether. An increase in labour force participation, which would translate into a higher\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate, was expected to result partly from JobSeeker recipients again having to undertake job\n\t\t\t\tsearch activities to qualify for the payment and partly from the progressive lifting of restrictions\n\t\t\t\tenabling more people to search for work. In considering other possible paths for the unemployment rate,\n\t\t\t\tmembers noted that the upside scenario could result in a slightly lower peak in the unemployment rate,\n\t\t\t\tand a faster subsequent decline, falling to around 6 per cent by the end of 2022.\n\t\t\t\tAlternatively, in the downside scenario, the unemployment rate would be expected to peak at around\n\t\t\t\t10½ per cent, and decline very gradually to around 9 per cent by the end of the\n\t\t\t\tforecast period.</p>", "<p>In turning to the discussion on recent inflation developments, members noted that the\n\t\t\t\t2 per cent decline in headline CPI in the June quarter reflected unusually large declines in a\n\t\t\t\tnumber of components, including child care and pre-school fees, petrol prices and rents, and the effect\n\t\t\t\tof rebates on some administered items. In underlying terms, the severe contraction in economic activity\n\t\t\t\tin the June quarter had resulted in disinflationary pressures, although prices of certain grocery and\n\t\t\t\thousehold items had risen because of strong demand and constraints on supply. Around\n\t\t\t\t9 per cent of the CPI basket was not available to have prices measured for at least some of\n\t\t\t\tthe quarter, necessitating the use of imputed prices. Members noted that the June quarter outcomes for\n\t\t\t\tchild care and pre-school fees, and fuel prices, would be largely reversed in the September quarter.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, the weakness observed in rents in the June quarter was expected to persist over the forecast\n\t\t\t\tperiod, given the slowdown in population growth because of lower migration.</p>", "<p>In discussing the outlook for inflation, members noted that significant spare capacity, high\n\t\t\t\tunemployment and slow wages growth would contribute to a prolonged period of low inflation. The\n\t\t\t\tpossibility that supply disruptions could lessen disinflationary pressures was considered, but weakness\n\t\t\t\tin demand was expected to be the dominant factor affecting inflation outcomes in the period ahead.\n\t\t\t\tUnderlying inflation was forecast to remain below 2 per cent over the forecast period in each\n\t\t\t\tof the scenarios considered. In the baseline scenario, underlying inflation was expected to reach a\n\t\t\t\ttrough of around 1 per cent late in 2021 and to be around 1½ per cent by end\n\t\t\t\t2022. In the upside scenario, a more rapid tightening in the labour market was expected to contribute to\n\t\t\t\tinflation reaching around 1¾ per cent by the end of 2022. In the downside scenario, where\n\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rate remained at elevated levels over the forecast period, inflation was expected to\n\t\t\t\ttrough at around ½ per cent and increase only a little by the end of 2022. But the\n\t\t\t\toverall message from the scenario analysis was that underlying inflationary pressures would remain\n\t\t\t\tsubdued for a considerable period.</p>"], "International Financial Markets": ["<p>Members noted that global financial conditions had remained accommodative. Central banks in the\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies had mostly left their policy settings unchanged and had continued to signal that they\n\t\t\t\twould maintain highly accommodative monetary policies for some time. Central banks' asset purchase\n\t\t\t\tprograms had contributed to the accommodative financial conditions, with market functioning having been\n\t\t\t\tlargely restored. These purchases had assisted bond markets to absorb the significant increase in\n\t\t\t\tsovereign debt issuance associated with the expansion in fiscal policy, thereby helping to keep\n\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields around historic lows. Spreads between the yields of euro area periphery bonds and\n\t\t\t\tGerman Bunds had declined following the announcement of a €750 billion package of loans and\n\t\t\t\tgrants designed to support the recovery in Europe.</p>", "<p>Over the preceding month, the Bank of Canada had committed to maintaining its policy rate at the\n\t\t\t\teffective lower bound until spare capacity had been absorbed and the inflation target had been\n\t\t\t\tsustainably achieved. The US Federal Reserve had extended the duration of various lending\n\t\t\t\tfacilities.</p>", "<p>The costs of raising corporate debt had remained low. Corporate debt issuance had eased in July, from\n\t\t\t\tthe record high levels in preceding months. Equity market prices had risen further and had recovered\n\t\t\t\tmuch of their sharp falls from earlier in the year, supported by optimism around the development of a\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 vaccine and a general expectation that the decline in earnings recorded in the first half\n\t\t\t\tof the year would be relatively short-lived. Members noted that the relative strength of US equity\n\t\t\t\tprices could be explained partly by the large weight in market indexes of tech-related stocks, which had\n\t\t\t\tbenefited from an increase in demand for digital services and online shopping. By contrast, low oil\n\t\t\t\tprices had contributed to the underperformance of energy stocks. In Australia, equity prices had\n\t\t\t\trecovered around half of their decline earlier in the year.</p>", "<p>Financial conditions in emerging markets had improved a little over the prior month. Low and stable\n\t\t\t\tinflation had allowed for a further easing in monetary policies. Also, capital flows had mostly\n\t\t\t\tstabilised, following significant portfolio outflows earlier in the year. Indeed, currency intervention\n\t\t\t\toperations had been scaled back and exchange rates had generally stabilised, although at lower levels\n\t\t\t\tthan before the outbreak of the pandemic. Members noted that many emerging market economies in Asia had\n\t\t\t\tperformed well compared with other emerging market economies because they had faced the onset of the\n\t\t\t\tpandemic with stronger economic fundamentals.</p>", "<p>In China, better-than-expected domestic economic data had contributed to a strong increase in equity\n\t\t\t\tprices early in July, while money market conditions had tightened, consistent with the improved economic\n\t\t\t\tsituation and the authorities' desire to limit the build-up of risks in parts of the financial\n\t\t\t\tsystem. While this had led to a broader increase in borrowing rates, financial conditions had generally\n\t\t\t\tremained accommodative and broad measures of financing were growing at a slightly faster rate than in\n\t\t\t\t2019, as intended.</p>", "<p>Members noted that there had been a broad-based depreciation of the US dollar, and that the\n\t\t\t\tcurrencies of other advanced economies had returned to levels seen earlier in the year. The euro had\n\t\t\t\tappreciated to its highest level in several years, supported by the recent agreement on a European Union\n\t\t\t\trecovery fund. The Australian dollar had also appreciated against the US dollar to be a little\n\t\t\t\tabove where it had started the year. The Australian dollar had been broadly in line with its fundamental\n\t\t\t\tdeterminants, such as commodity prices and interest rate differentials, which had returned to their\n\t\t\t\tlevels at the start of the year. Despite further tensions between China and the United States, the\n\t\t\t\tChinese renminbi had remained stable.</p>"], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of domestic financial markets by noting that government bond markets\n\t\t\t\thad continued to function normally alongside a significant increase in issuance. The yield on 10-year\n\t\t\t\tAustralian Government Securities (AGS) had remained low. While the yield on 3-year AGS had remained\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with the target, it had been a little higher than 25 basis points over the preceding\n\t\t\t\tweeks. Members supported the Bank purchasing AGS in the secondary market to ensure that the yield on the\n\t\t\t\t3-year bond remained consistent with the target. Conditions in markets for bonds issued by the state and\n\t\t\t\tterritory borrowing authorities (semis) had normalised in recent months.</p>", "<p>Activity in the cash market had remained low, reflecting sizeable Exchange Settlement balances, and the\n\t\t\t\tcash rate had remained around 13 basis points. Other money market rates had also remained low.</p>", "<p>Funding costs for banks had eased a little further to historic lows. Take-up of the Term Funding\n\t\t\t\tFacility (TFF) had increased as the end-September deadline for accessing initial allowances had drawn\n\t\t\t\tcloser. Many banks had indicated that they would have taken up their initial allowance in full by that\n\t\t\t\ttime. Members noted that funding through the TFF was a less expensive option than issuing bonds. The\n\t\t\t\tstock of bonds on issue by the major banks had declined, but remained substantial.</p>", "<p>Interest rates for business loans had also fallen to historically low levels because banks had passed\n\t\t\t\tthrough the cash rate reductions and the effects of other policy measures to business borrowers.\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, business lending had contracted, following strong growth earlier in the year, as large\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses repaid credit they had earlier drawn down for precautionary reasons in response to the\n\t\t\t\tpandemic. Meanwhile, lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many of which were operating\n\t\t\t\tin the most affected sectors of the economy, had been little changed. Demand for new loans –\n\t\t\t\tespecially from SMEs – had been low, reflecting the weak economic conditions and the unusually\n\t\t\t\tuncertain outlook, although the supply of credit also appeared to have tightened a little. Members noted\n\t\t\t\tthe importance of the JobKeeper program and other policy interventions for supporting SMEs through the\n\t\t\t\tcurrent difficult period.</p>", "<p>Interest rates on housing loans had also declined to historic lows; over half of the decline in the\n\t\t\t\tcash rate in 2020 had flowed through to variable mortgage rates. Competition for high-quality borrowers\n\t\t\t\thad remained strong and rates on fixed-rate loans had declined to be noticeably lower than variable\n\t\t\t\trates; a larger-than-usual share of borrowers had applied for fixed-rate loans. External refinancing had\n\t\t\t\trisen sharply, consistent with the very low level of interest rates and offers of cash back to borrowers\n\t\t\t\tfor refinancing an existing loan previously held with another lender. Commitments for refinancing had\n\t\t\t\trecently been almost as high as those for new loans. Banks had announced extensions to their loan\n\t\t\t\tpayment deferral schemes, but were encouraging borrowers to make repayments if they could afford to do\n\t\t\t\tso. The balance in offset and redraw accounts had risen noticeably in April and May, but borrowers had\n\t\t\t\twithdrawn some of these funds in June; even so, balances held in these accounts remained large and above\n\t\t\t\tlevels in March.</p>", "<p>Owner-occupier housing credit growth had slowed and investor housing credit had continued to decline,\n\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the earlier slowdown in housing market activity and the decline in loan commitments\n\t\t\t\t\tsince March. While activity in the housing market and loan commitments had picked up in recent months,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flow of new commitments had remained well below its peak and was likely to remain subdued in the\n\t\t\t\t\tface of recent developments in Victoria and uncertainty about the economic recovery.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global economy was experiencing a severe\n\t\t\t\tdownturn as countries sought to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Even though the worst of the global\n\t\t\t\teconomic contraction had passed, the outlook remained highly uncertain and would depend upon containment\n\t\t\t\tof the coronavirus. Infection rates had declined in some countries, but were still very high and rising\n\t\t\t\tin other countries.</p>", "<p>The Australian economy was going through a very difficult period and was experiencing the biggest shock\n\t\t\t\tto economic activity since the 1930s. A very large number of people had lost their jobs, with many\n\t\t\t\tothers retaining their jobs over this period only because of government support programs. Nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\tmembers noted that the downturn had not been as severe as earlier expected and a recovery was under way\n\t\t\t\tin most of Australia. The recovery was, however, likely to be slower than earlier expected, with the\n\t\t\t\tCOVID-19 outbreak in Victoria having a major impact on the economy. Uncertainty about the health\n\t\t\t\tsituation and the future path of the economy was continuing to affect the spending plans of many\n\t\t\t\thouseholds and businesses.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the Bank's policy package was continuing to work broadly as expected. The\n\t\t\t\tpackage had helped to lower funding costs and stabilise financial conditions, and was supporting the\n\t\t\t\teconomy. There was a very high level of liquidity in the Australian financial system and authorised\n\t\t\t\tdeposit-taking institutions were continuing to draw on the TFF, with further use expected over\n\t\t\t\tsubsequent months. Members noted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital and\n\t\t\t\tliquidity buffers, remained resilient and was helping the economy traverse this difficult period.\n\t\t\t\tGovernment bond markets were operating effectively and the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds\n\t\t\t\thad been consistent with the target of around 25 basis points. The yield had, however, been a\n\t\t\t\tlittle higher than 25 basis points over the weeks preceding the meeting. Given this, the Bank would\n\t\t\t\tpurchase Australian Government bonds in the secondary market from 5 August 2020 as necessary to\n\t\t\t\tensure that the yield on 3-year bonds remains consistent with the target. It would also stand ready to\n\t\t\t\tpurchase Australian Government bonds and semis in the event of a recurrence of market dysfunction.</p>", "<p>Members reaffirmed that there was no need to adjust the package of measures in Australia in the current\n\t\t\t\tenvironment. Members agreed, however, to continue to assess the evolving situation in Australia and did\n\t\t\t\tnot rule out adjusting the current package if circumstances warranted.</p>", "<p>Board members recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and\n\t\t\t\tmonetary policy in Australia was helping to sustain the economy through this difficult period. They\n\t\t\t\twelcomed the Australian Government's recent announcement that various income support measures would\n\t\t\t\tbe extended, and considered it likely that fiscal and monetary support would be required for some time\n\t\t\t\tgiven the outlook for the economy and the labour market. The Board affirmed its commitment to supporting\n\t\t\t\tjobs, incomes and businesses and to making sure that Australia is well placed for recovery. The Board\n\t\t\t\tconsidered that its actions were keeping funding costs low and supporting the supply of credit to\n\t\t\t\thouseholds and businesses, and resolved that this accommodative approach would be maintained for as long\n\t\t\t\tas necessary.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board reaffirmed the elements of the policy package announced on 19 March 2020, namely:</p>", "<p>The Board affirmed that the yield target for 3-year bonds would be maintained until progress is made\n\t\t\t\ttowards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would be\n\t\t\t\tappropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself is raised.

However, more recently the global recovery had slowed and become more\n\t\t\t\tuneven, with infection rates rising again in some countries; further fresh outbreaks of the virus had\n\t\t\t\tbeen seen in Japan, South Korea, some countries in Western Europe and New Zealand. This had led to a\n\t\t\t\ttargeted tightening in restrictions, and some renewed signs of precautionary behaviour. Consistent with\n\t\t\t\tthis, mobility indicators had flattened out. Members noted that the future path of the global recovery\n\t\t\t\twould remain highly dependent on containment of the virus.</p>", "<p>The first half of 2020 had seen the largest contraction in global economic activity in many decades.\n\t\t\t\tThe extent of the declines in GDP varied significantly across economies, depending on the severity of\n\t\t\t\tthe pandemic and the intensity of the containment measures. Some countries had experienced contractions\n\t\t\t\tof around 20 per cent in the first half of the year, although the decline in output in\n\t\t\t\tAustralia was expected to have been less severe.</p>", "<p>In turning to labour market outcomes in advanced economies, members noted that total hours worked\n\t\t\t\tremained 5–10 per cent below pre-pandemic levels, despite having increased recently.\n\t\t\t\tThe extent to which lower total hours worked had been accounted for by reductions in average hours\n\t\t\t\tand/or employment depended in large part on the scope of wage subsidies and other fiscal support\n\t\t\t\tschemes. It was noted that in the United States most of the decline had been in the form of fewer\n\t\t\t\temployees rather than lower average hours worked. This was because, unlike in most other advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies, income support in the United States had mostly comprised increased unemployment benefits\n\t\t\t\trather than wage subsidies.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the severe disruptions to global trade flows that had been experienced since the\n\t\t\t\toutbreak of the pandemic, as seen in the sharp contraction in exports and imports in many economies.\n\t\t\t\tThis had also been evident in Australian trade volumes. While the shock to aggregate demand had been\n\t\t\t\tcentral to the decline in global trade flows, disruptions to supply stemming from health measures had\n\t\t\t\talso affected the ability of some economies to produce exports. China had been less affected than most\n\t\t\t\teconomies in this regard, with production and exports both having rebounded strongly.</p>", "<p>Members noted that in China production had rebounded much more strongly than consumption, which had not\n\t\t\t\tbeen the typical pattern of recovery observed in other economies. Differences in the emphasis of fiscal\n\t\t\t\tpolicy support had largely accounted for this. In China, policy support had been aimed mainly at\n\t\t\t\tsupporting businesses and stimulating investment; income transfers to households had been modest. As a\n\t\t\t\tresult, fixed asset investment and industrial production had returned to pre-pandemic levels, while\n\t\t\t\tconsumption had recovered at a slower pace. In advanced economies, household income transfers had\n\t\t\t\tfeatured much more prominently in fiscal support packages, which had supported household disposable\n\t\t\t\tincome and consumption to a greater extent than production.</p>", "<p>Recent inflation outcomes around the world had reflected a combination of factors. In addition to the\n\t\t\t\teffects of a large negative aggregate demand shock, these outcomes reflected a significant shift in\n\t\t\t\tdemand towards goods, lower demand for services and disruptions to supply. The net of these factors had\n\t\t\t\tbeen subdued overall inflationary pressure. However, prices for some goods, such as food, motor vehicles\n\t\t\t\t&amp; parts and household furnishings, had risen at a solid pace in some countries.</p>", "<p>Members also noted that large shifts in the demand for and supply of commodities had been occurring. Of\n\t\t\t\tmost relevance to Australia, iron ore prices had been around multi-year highs. Demand for iron ore from\n\t\t\t\tChina had been strong given that steel-intensive activity such as construction had bounced back quickly.\n\t\t\t\tOngoing supply issues in Brazil had also supported iron ore prices. Gold prices had recently traded at\n\t\t\t\tall-time highs, partly reflecting increased investment demand in an environment of low global interest\n\t\t\t\trates. By contrast, coal prices had been around multi-year lows, reflecting lower demand in India and\n\t\t\t\telsewhere, and abundant global supply. In terms of key resource export volumes, members noted that\n\t\t\t\tAustralian exports of iron ore to China had remained resilient in recent months.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic conditions by noting that the contraction in\n\t\t\t\tJune quarter GDP in Australia was expected to be less severe than in many other countries and broadly in\n\t\t\t\tline with projections in the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. However, it was expected\n\t\t\t\tthat the national accounts (scheduled for release the day after the meeting) would confirm the economy\n\t\t\t\thad experienced its largest single-quarter contraction in the history of the quarterly national\n\t\t\t\taccounts.</p>", "<p>Recent data indicated that non-mining business investment in the June quarter had not been as weak as\n\t\t\t\tearlier feared, particularly spending on machinery &amp; equipment. However, non-mining and mining\n\t\t\t\tinvestment intentions for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> had been little changed from three\n\t\t\t\tmonths prior, and had continued to indicate a very weak outlook for capital expenditure overall.</p>", "<p>Members noted that household consumption had contracted significantly in the June quarter, with the\n\t\t\t\tdecline in April having been particularly steep. Since then, consumption had started to recover, but was\n\t\t\t\tstill well below pre-pandemic levels. Restrictions on activity had constrained spending in Victoria,\n\t\t\t\twith retail spending there much weaker than in the rest of the country. Business liaison and other\n\t\t\t\thigher frequency indicators suggested retail sales had declined significantly in Victoria in August.\n\t\t\t\tMembers noted that spending on other services in Victoria would also be severely affected during the\n\t\t\t\tlockdowns. Overall, household consumption in Australia was still expected to increase in the September\n\t\t\t\tquarter, but this would only partly reverse the contraction that had been experienced earlier in the\n\t\t\t\tyear.</p>", "<p>In their discussion of the housing market, members noted that prices for established dwellings in\n\t\t\t\tMelbourne and, to a lesser extent, Sydney had declined in recent months, but price movements had been\n\t\t\t\tmixed elsewhere. The cumulative decline in established national housing prices in 2020 had been less\n\t\t\t\tthan experienced two years earlier. Meanwhile, rental markets had remained weak. Rental supply had been\n\t\t\t\tboosted by short-term and holiday rentals being brought onto the long-term rental market, while demand\n\t\t\t\thad been depressed by the reduced flow of new migrants and a decline in the rate of household formation.\n\t\t\t\tRental vacancy rates had risen recently, and members noted that downward pressure on rents was unlikely\n\t\t\t\tto dissipate in the near term in either Sydney or Melbourne.</p>", "<p>Turning to the labour market, members observed that the increase in employment in July had been\n\t\t\t\tstronger than generally expected, but not enough to prevent a rise in the unemployment rate. The number\n\t\t\t\tof people who had left the labour force during the June quarter but were now actively searching for work\n\t\t\t\thad increased. This was expected to continue through the remainder of 2020 as restrictions on activity\n\t\t\t\tand health concerns eased and mutual obligations under the JobSeeker program were reinstated. Measures\n\t\t\t\tof labour underutilisation had eased, but remained very high. It was noted that around half of the\n\t\t\t\tcontraction in total hours worked had been reversed in preceding months, with average hours picking up\n\t\t\t\tmore quickly than employment. Many part-time workers had reverted to working their usual hours after\n\t\t\t\thaving been on low or zero hours earlier in the year.</p>", "<p>More timely payroll data suggested the number of jobs in the weeks up to early August had declined a\n\t\t\t\tlittle, with a notable drop in jobs in Victoria. The recent decline in Victoria had erased much of the\n\t\t\t\trecovery in jobs between April and June. Outside of Victoria, the recovery in jobs appeared to have\n\t\t\t\tslowed.</p>", "<p>Members observed that the 1.8 per cent increase in the wage price index over the year to June\n\t\t\t\twas the lowest rate of growth in the history of the series. In discussing the subdued private wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth outcomes in the June quarter, members noted that firms had responded more swiftly than in\n\t\t\t\tprevious downturns to the weakening in demand by slowing the pace of wage increases. In some industries,\n\t\t\t\tsuch as construction, professional services and some other service industries, a small number of large\n\t\t\t\twage reductions had contributed to a decline for the industry in aggregate. Business liaison contacts\n\t\t\t\thad also suggested that firms were more likely to have instituted wage freezes than in the past, and\n\t\t\t\tthat it was not uncommon for senior managers and executives in some industries to have experienced\n\t\t\t\ttemporary wage cuts. Wage and price pressures more generally were expected to remain subdued for some\n\t\t\t\ttime.</p>", "<p>Members noted the important role that fiscal policy had played in supporting the economy since the\n\t\t\t\toutbreak of the pandemic. Income transfers to households from the Australian Government had provided a\n\t\t\t\tsubstantial boost to household income and consumption, as well as to business cash flows. Members also\n\t\t\t\tnoted that state and territory governments had played important roles in complementing these income\n\t\t\t\ttransfers in the period ahead, mainly by increasing direct spending on goods and services and job\n\t\t\t\tcreation. Governments at this level had considerable experience to draw on in service delivery,\n\t\t\t\temployment and implementing direct purchases of goods and services. They also accounted for a larger\n\t\t\t\tshare of public demand than the Australian Government. Members noted that debt levels relative to the\n\t\t\t\tsize of the economy were low for the Australian and state governments. Overall, public sector balance\n\t\t\t\tsheets in Australia were assessed as being strong. In an environment of record low borrowing rates and\n\t\t\t\tsignificant spare capacity in the economy, this meant fiscal policy was well placed to continue to\n\t\t\t\tsupport the recovery.</p>"], "International Financial Markets": ["<p>Members noted that global financial conditions had remained accommodative, supported by substantial\n\t\t\t\tpolicy stimulus. Central banks had continued to emphasise that they would maintain the current easy\n\t\t\t\tstance of monetary policies for some time and provide further stimulus if required. In August, the\n\t\t\t\tReserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) had increased the total size and extended the duration of its\n\t\t\t\tgovernment bond purchase program. At the same time, the RBNZ had been considering a negative policy rate\n\t\t\t\tand an expanded term funding scheme.</p>", "<p>The US Federal Reserve had announced that, following a comprehensive review of its monetary policy\n\t\t\t\tframework, it would now pursue a flexible average inflation target and increase the emphasis placed on\n\t\t\t\tachieving maximum employment. Most commentators had concluded that this implied the Federal Reserve\n\t\t\t\twould maintain a stimulatory monetary policy stance for longer than initially thought and until\n\t\t\t\tinflation was moderately above 2 per cent for a time.</p>", "<p>Government bond yields had remained historically low across advanced economies, although yields had\n\t\t\t\tincreased a little over the preceding month. Market-implied inflation expectations had increased\n\t\t\t\tsteadily to be around the levels last seen at the beginning of 2020. Accordingly, yields had declined in\n\t\t\t\treal terms over prior months and were at very low levels, consistent with very stimulatory policy\n\t\t\t\tsettings.</p>", "<p>Equity prices in major markets had increased further over August. This partly reflected the fact that\n\t\t\t\tthe fall in corporate earnings in the first half of 2020 had been smaller than initially feared.\n\t\t\t\tInvestors had also appeared to expect the declines in corporate earnings to be short-lived. The high\n\t\t\t\tlevel of equity prices had also reflected low discount rates, consistent with the low level of bond\n\t\t\t\tyields. Members noted that when total returns – which include dividend payments – were\n\t\t\t\ttaken into account, Australian equities had performed similarly to equity markets in most other advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies, apart from the United States, where equity markets had outperformed.</p>", "<p>Corporations across the major economies had continued to benefit from accommodative funding conditions\n\t\t\t\tin debt markets. Spreads on corporate bonds had remained low and bond issuance had been relatively\n\t\t\t\tstrong in the United States. Business credit growth had been strong following the onset of the pandemic,\n\t\t\t\tbut had eased over recent months. Members noted that there had been some tightening in banks'\n\t\t\t\tlending standards for business borrowers, and discussed the relative importance of demand and supply\n\t\t\t\tfactors for business credit in the current environment.</p>", "<p>In China, the authorities had indicated their comfort with the current stance of monetary policy and\n\t\t\t\thad re-emphasised their focus on managing medium-term financial stability risks, such as high leverage.\n\t\t\t\tThe authorities had also signalled their concern about non-performing loans in the period ahead. The\n\t\t\t\tChinese renminbi had been relatively stable, despite ongoing tensions between the United States and\n\t\t\t\tChina.</p>", "<p>Financial conditions in emerging markets had been relatively stable, particularly in Asia. Members\n\t\t\t\tnoted, however, that some emerging economies, including Brazil, Russia, South Africa and Turkey, had\n\t\t\t\texperienced volatility in their financial markets and exchange rates in recent months; these economies\n\t\t\t\thad existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities before the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span>\n\t\t\t\tpandemic.</p>", "<p>The US dollar had depreciated significantly against the currencies of other advanced economies\n\t\t\t\tover recent months, including the Australian dollar. In part, this reflected an unwinding of the earlier\n\t\t\t\tappreciation of the US dollar related to an episode of financial market volatility in March and\n\t\t\t\tApril during which investors had sought less risky investments. The appreciation of the Australian\n\t\t\t\tdollar had been consistent with the increase in commodity prices, particularly iron ore prices, over\n\t\t\t\trecent months. While members noted that the Australian dollar was broadly aligned with its fundamental\n\t\t\t\tdeterminants, a lower exchange rate would provide more assistance to the Australian economy in its\n\t\t\t\trecovery.</p>"], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["<p>In Australia, the Board's policy measures continued to underpin accommodative financial\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions. Reflecting the large amount of liquidity in the system, the cash rate had remained very\n\t\t\t\t\tlow, at around 13 basis points, and investors expected it to remain at that level for some time.\n\t\t\t\t\tSimilarly, money market rates had remained very low.</p>", "<p>The Bank had purchased about $10 billion of Australian Government Securities (AGS) in August in\n\t\t\t\t\tsupport of the 3-year yield target for AGS of around 25 basis points. Following the Bank's\n\t\t\t\t\tpurchases, the yield on the AGS bond maturing in April 2023, which is currently the bond with a\n\t\t\t\t\tmaturity closest to three years, had declined to be closer to 25 basis points. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe focus of the yield target will increasingly shift to the April 2024 bond, which will become the\n\t\t\t\t\tbond with a maturity closest to three years in the second half of October 2020. Government bond markets\n\t\t\t\t\thad continued to function smoothly, with large issuance by the Australian Government and states met by\n\t\t\t\t\tconsistently strong demand.</p>", "<p>Banks' funding costs were at historic lows and banks had good access to funding. Take-up of the\n\t\t\t\t\tReserve Bank's Term Funding Facility (TFF) had continued to pick up as the end-September deadline\n\t\t\t\t\tfor drawing initial allocations approached. Banks had also continued to receive large inflows of\n\t\t\t\t\tdeposits, another relatively low-cost source of funding. The increase in funding from the TFF and\n\t\t\t\t\tlow-cost deposits had been partly offset by banks not replacing wholesale bond funding as it matured;\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch of the decline in bank bonds on issue this year had been concentrated in bonds issued\n\t\t\t\t\toffshore.</p>", "<p>The cash rate reductions and other policy measures had flowed through to interest rates on business\n\t\t\t\t\tloans, which were historically low. Members observed that, nevertheless, demand for business loans had\n\t\t\t\t\tremained subdued, reflecting the weakness in economic conditions and the high level of uncertainty.\n\t\t\t\t\tLarge businesses had repaid the bulk of the funds obtained from existing credit lines in March and\n\t\t\t\t\tApril, while lending to small and medium-sized enterprises had been little changed for some time.\n\t\t\t\t\tInterest rates on housing loans had also been at historic lows. Over half of the decline in the cash\n\t\t\t\t\trate since February had flowed through to variable rates, and fixed housing loan rates had declined by\n\t\t\t\t\teven more. There had been a large amount of refinancing activity, with a greater-than-usual share of\n\t\t\t\t\tborrowers moving to fixed-rate home loans.</p>", "<p>Growth in housing credit to owner-occupiers had eased in recent months to around 5 per cent\n\t\t\t\t\ton an annualised basis, while housing credit to investors had continued to decline. This largely\n\t\t\t\t\treflected reduced demand from borrowers, given the weak and uncertain economic environment and its\n\t\t\t\t\teffect on the housing market. Housing loan commitments had increased over June and July, but had\n\t\t\t\t\tremained below their recent peak. Payments into offset and redraw accounts had increased substantially\n\t\t\t\t\tin July. This partly reflected the early release of superannuation funds to some households at the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning of the new financial year, along with government payments and tax refunds. In locations where\n\t\t\t\t\tmovement had been restricted, this had also reflected fewer opportunities for spending.</p>", "<p>Members noted that, in addition to weak demand for household and business borrowing, the supply of\n\t\t\t\t\tcredit had also tightened somewhat since earlier in the year, reflecting the uncertain economic\n\t\t\t\t\toutlook. Banks had been offering extensions of loan deferral periods where appropriate and generally\n\t\t\t\t\thad been encouraging borrowers to make repayments if they could afford to do so.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global economy had been experiencing an\n\t\t\t\tuneven recovery after a very severe contraction in the first half of 2020. Some economies with high or\n\t\t\t\trising <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> infection rates had recently lost momentum. In contrast,\n\t\t\t\teconomic growth had been relatively strong in China. The future path of the recovery was highly\n\t\t\t\tdependent on containment of the virus.</p>", "<p>The Australian economy had been going through a very difficult period and was experiencing the biggest\n\t\t\t\tshock to economic activity since the 1930s. Nevertheless, members noted that the downturn had not been\n\t\t\t\tas severe as earlier expected and a recovery was under way in most of Australia. However, the recovery\n\t\t\t\twas likely to be uneven, with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> outbreak in Victoria having a\n\t\t\t\tmajor effect on the economy. Uncertainty about the health situation and the future path of the economy\n\t\t\t\twas continuing to affect the spending plans of many households and businesses. Wage and price pressures\n\t\t\t\tremained subdued and this was likely to continue for some time.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the Board's policy package implemented in mid March was continuing to support\n\t\t\t\tthe Australian economy. There was a very high level of liquidity in the Australian financial system and\n\t\t\t\tthe policy package had helped to lower funding costs. Members noted that the Australian banking system,\n\t\t\t\twith its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping the economy\n\t\t\t\ttraverse this difficult period.</p>", "<p>Over the prior month, the Bank had purchased AGS in support of the Board's 3-year yield target of\n\t\t\t\taround 25 basis points, and members agreed that further purchases should be undertaken as necessary\n\t\t\t\tto maintain the target. Government bond markets had been operating effectively, alongside a significant\n\t\t\t\tincrease in issuance. The Bank stood ready to purchase AGS and semi-government securities in the event\n\t\t\t\tof a recurrence of market dysfunction.</p>", "<p>Members reviewed the operation of the TFF, given the uncertain economic outlook and that the initial\n\t\t\t\tallowance of 3 per cent of credit had to be drawn down by the end of September 2020. They\n\t\t\t\tagreed that the TFF had worked as intended and that, given the economic outlook, an expansion of the TFF\n\t\t\t\twas appropriate. In particular, the Board agreed to increase the size of the TFF and allow drawing of\n\t\t\t\tfunds up until June 2021. Under an expanded TFF, authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) would\n\t\t\t\thave access to additional funding, equivalent to 2 per cent of their outstanding credit, at a\n\t\t\t\tfixed rate of 25 basis points for three years. ADIs would be able to draw on this extra funding\n\t\t\t\tuntil the end of June 2021. This extension would ensure that all ADIs continued to have access to the\n\t\t\t\tTFF after the end of September 2020. The availability of additional allowances associated with an\n\t\t\t\tADI's growth of business credit would also be extended beyond the end of March 2021 to the end of\n\t\t\t\tJune 2021. This further easing of monetary policy would bring the total amount available under this\n\t\t\t\tfacility to around $200 billion. This would help keep interest rates low for borrowers and support\n\t\t\t\tthe provision of credit by providing ADIs greater confidence about their continued access to low-cost\n\t\t\t\tfunding.</p>", "<p>Members recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary\n\t\t\t\tpolicy in Australia was helping to sustain the economy through this difficult period. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\tpublic sector balance sheets in Australia were strong, which allowed for the provision of continued\n\t\t\t\tsupport. They considered it likely that fiscal and monetary support would be required for some time\n\t\t\t\tgiven the outlook for the economy and the labour market. The Board affirmed its commitment to supporting\n\t\t\t\tjobs, incomes and businesses in Australia. It agreed to maintain highly accommodative settings as long\n\t\t\t\tas required and to continue to consider how further monetary measures could support the recovery.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board reaffirmed the elements of the policy package announced on 19 March 2020, namely:</p>", "<p>The Board agreed to increase the size of the Term Funding Facility and make the facility available for\n\t\t\t\tlonger.</p>", "<p>The Board reaffirmed that the yield target for 3-year bonds would be maintained until progress is made\n\t\t\t\ttowards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target, and that it would be\n\t\t\t\tappropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself is raised. The Board also reaffirmed\n\t\t\t\tthat it would not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment and it is\n\t\t\t\tconfident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target band.</p>"]}},

Countries that had struggled to contain the coronavirus, and/or\n\t\t\t\thad imposed severe nationwide lockdowns, had experienced larger contractions in output in the first half\n\t\t\t\tof the year. Members noted that Australia's economic and health outcomes this year had compared\n\t\t\t\tfavourably with the international experience.</p>", "<p>In their discussion of developments over recent weeks, members noted that a number of countries,\n\t\t\t\tincluding in Western Europe, were experiencing a second wave of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span>\n\t\t\t\tcases. Most countries had imposed targeted restrictions in response, rather than nationwide lockdowns as\n\t\t\t\thad been the case earlier in the year. More broadly, timely readings on global activity and labour\n\t\t\t\tmarkets, including job advertisements, were pointing to a gradual recovery in the global economy, but\n\t\t\t\twith significant spare capacity remaining. This was likely to keep underlying global inflation pressures\n\t\t\t\tlow.</p>", "<p>In turning to the recovery in China and other east Asian economies, members noted that exports and\n\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production had both recovered, but at different speeds. The extent of supply disruptions,\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferences in industry composition and changes in demand had all contributed to this pattern. Members\n\t\t\t\t\tnoted that demand for China's exports had picked up. Elsewhere in east Asia, changing trade\n\t\t\t\t\tpatterns highlighted the varied nature of the economic shock induced by the pandemic. Economies most\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolved in the production of semiconductors and other technology items for export, such as South\n\t\t\t\t\tKorea, had recorded a strong recovery in industrial production. By contrast, in those economies more\n\t\t\t\t\tgeared to the global automotive market, such as Japan and Thailand, industrial production had\n\t\t\t\t\texperienced a more subdued recovery.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic developments by reviewing the very large\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraction in activity in the June quarter. Excluding public demand, expenditure had declined very\n\t\t\t\t\tsharply. Consumption fell by 12 per cent, driven by a halving in spending on discretionary\n\t\t\t\t\tservices. Dwelling investment fell by 7 per cent and business investment declined by\n\t\t\t\t\t4 per cent. These contractions in investment had been less than expected. Activity in the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstruction industry had not been disrupted to the extent initially anticipated, while the accelerated\n\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation allowance had encouraged more business spending on vehicles and other equipment than\n\t\t\t\t\tinitially expected.</p>", "<p>In comparing consumption in the June quarter in Australia with that in other advanced economies,\n\t\t\t\t\tmembers noted that domestic consumption of durable goods had been positive and stronger than elsewhere,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile domestic consumption of non-durable goods and services had experienced large declines more in\n\t\t\t\t\tline with the experience abroad. Members also noted that indicators of consumption in the September\n\t\t\t\t\tquarter had been stronger than expected.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the significant increase in household savings in the June quarter and the\n\t\t\t\timplications of this for the outlook. The sharp increase in savings reflected the record decline in\n\t\t\t\thousehold consumption, mainly driven by constraints on certain types of consumption owing to the\n\t\t\t\trestrictions on activity, as many services could not be offered for sale. At the same time, household\n\t\t\t\tincome had increased, supported by a number of policy measures, including the JobKeeper program and the\n\t\t\t\tCoronavirus Supplement paid to JobSeeker recipients. There had been some substitution toward the\n\t\t\t\tconsumption of goods and services not affected by restrictions (such as home office equipment and\n\t\t\t\thousehold goods), but the overall effect of the restrictions on activity, combined with large income\n\t\t\t\ttransfers from the government, had been to reduce consumption relative to household income. A higher\n\t\t\t\tlevel of precautionary savings also accounted for part of the increase in household savings. In\n\t\t\t\taddition, household cash flow had been boosted by the significant volume of superannuation\n\t\t\t\twithdrawals.</p>", "<p>In discussing the implications of the increase in savings for the outlook, members noted that savings\n\t\t\t\tbehaviour in the period ahead could differ markedly across households. Some people were likely to\n\t\t\t\tincrease their consumption (relative to income) as remaining restrictions on activity were lifted, while\n\t\t\t\thouseholds concerned about potential job losses would be inclined to maintain higher-than-usual levels\n\t\t\t\tof savings as insurance against lower income in the future.</p>", "<p>Members discussed a range of other policy changes that had supported economic activity in recent\n\t\t\t\t\tmonths. Activity in the detached housing market had picked up, particularly in Western Australia, as a\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of the Australian Government's HomeBuilder package and state government incentives. The\n\t\t\t\t\tinstant asset write-off scheme had also contributed to the stronger-than-expected outcome for\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining business investment in the June quarter.</p>", "<p>In turning to the labour market, members noted the substantial effect of the Stage\n\t\t\t\t\t4 restrictions in Victoria, while conditions in the labour market in other parts of the country\n\t\t\t\t\thad continued to improve. Jobs, employment and hours worked had recently declined in Victoria to around\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels previously recorded in May. For the country as a whole, however, members noted that the\n\t\t\t\t\tdeterioration in the labour market through the pandemic had been somewhat less severe than had been\n\t\t\t\t\texpected. The unemployment rate was now expected to peak below the 10 per cent level\n\t\t\t\t\tprojected under the baseline forecast scenario in the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, substantial spare capacity remained in the labour market and its recovery over the medium\n\t\t\t\t\tterm was expected to be gradual.</p>", "<p>Members concluded their discussion of economic developments with a review of how businesses had\n\t\t\t\t\tresponded to the pandemic. A recent survey indicated that some of the changes made by firms were likely\n\t\t\t\t\tto be retained as a permanent feature of their business models, including, for example, the way that\n\t\t\t\t\tproducts and services are offered, such as the increased use of online distribution channels.\n\t\t\t\t\tInformation from business liaison contacts also suggested that, relative to the global financial\n\t\t\t\t\tcrisis, many firms had responded faster in reducing investment and employment, although this may have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen because the shock to activity was significantly larger. Members noted that cost control and major\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels of government assistance had supported the health of the business sector in aggregate, although\n\t\t\t\t\tthe future viability of some firms remained uncertain.</p>"], "Financial Stability": ["<p>Members were briefed on the evolution of financial stability risks in the Bank's regular\n\t\t\t\thalf-yearly assessment. An unprecedented policy response had quickly restored financial market\n\t\t\t\tfunctioning in the period soon after the onset of the pandemic. But with the economic recovery expected\n\t\t\t\tto take some time, financial stability risks were now more related to declining credit quality.</p>", "<p>Financial asset prices had rebounded from their lows in March, in part because of expectations of an\n\t\t\t\textended period of low risk-free interest rates. However, there had also been a sharp fall in the\n\t\t\t\tcompensation investors receive for risk. This was despite uncertainty stemming from the shape of the\n\t\t\t\trecovery and a rise in political tensions internationally, as well as expectations of rising\n\t\t\t\tinsolvencies and defaults. For some heavily affected sectors, lost output would not be recovered quickly\n\t\t\t\tand some businesses could face difficulty servicing their debts. These factors raised the risk of a\n\t\t\t\tsharp fall in asset prices. Globally, there had been a decline in credit quality prior to the pandemic,\n\t\t\t\twhich increased risks for investors, particularly those with leverage. Of note, there had been an\n\t\t\t\tincrease in the share of investment-grade bonds with a lower credit rating, and a substantial increase\n\t\t\t\tin the share of leveraged loans with few covenants.</p>", "<p>Banks in the advanced economies had started the year with high levels of capital and liquidity as a\n\t\t\t\tresult of reforms that had followed the global financial crisis of over a decade earlier. Their balance\n\t\t\t\tsheet strength had enabled banks to act as a shock-absorber for the real economy, rather than magnifying\n\t\t\t\tthe shock as they had during the global financial crisis. Policy actions, including decisions that loans\n\t\t\t\twith repayment deferrals be treated as performing and restrictions on shareholder pay-outs, had\n\t\t\t\tcontributed to banks' capital ratios remaining high. However, in some jurisdictions, banks had\n\t\t\t\tentered the period with structurally low profitability; this would make it more difficult if they needed\n\t\t\t\tto raise equity in stressed times and would be likely to make those banks more cautious in expanding\n\t\t\t\ttheir lending. These risks were particularly high for those European countries where low bank\n\t\t\t\tprofitability occurred in tandem with high levels of government debt, since a fall in sovereign debt\n\t\t\t\tvalues would erode bank capital and lead investors to question the government's ability to support\n\t\t\t\ttroubled banks.</p>", "<p>Members noted that many businesses in Australia had increased their cash buffers in 2020. Prior to the\n\t\t\t\tpandemic, firm-level data suggested that around half of businesses had enough cash to pay their expenses\n\t\t\t\tfor less than one month. However, by mid 2020, support measures provided by the government,\n\t\t\t\tlandlords and lenders had boosted businesses' cash buffers, with estimates suggesting that a\n\t\t\t\tsignificant share of businesses could cover at least six months of expenses. Listed companies had larger\n\t\t\t\tbuffers than private companies and unincorporated businesses. Members also noted that, for some\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses, their best survival strategy would be to hibernate until economic conditions had\n\t\t\t\tsufficiently normalised. Business failures had been substantially lower in 2020 than in preceding years\n\t\t\t\tbecause of insolvency moratoriums and the various support measures. However, business failures were\n\t\t\t\texpected to rise, particularly for small businesses.</p>", "<p>Risks for some types of commercial property were high as declining demand had increased the chance of\n\t\t\t\tfalling property values. Retail property vacancy rates had been rising prior to 2020 because of\n\t\t\t\tstructural changes in the retail sector. Efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus had\n\t\t\t\taccelerated this trend in the first half of 2020. Office vacancy rates had also increased given the\n\t\t\t\tdecline in economic activity, although this had been from low levels of vacancies, particularly in\n\t\t\t\tSydney and Melbourne. Nevertheless, an increase in office supply coupled with uncertainty about future\n\t\t\t\tworking conditions (and therefore office demand) increased the risk of falls in office property prices,\n\t\t\t\tparticularly for secondary-grade buildings. Members noted that demand for industrial property had been\n\t\t\t\tstrong prior to the pandemic, driven by increasing e-commerce, and that, if anything, this had since\n\t\t\t\tbeen reinforced. Banks' direct commercial property exposures had declined since the global\n\t\t\t\tfinancial crisis, although members noted there was uncertainty about the size of banks' indirect\n\t\t\t\texposures through lending to non-banks that subsequently lent to property investors, as well as the use\n\t\t\t\tof commercial property as collateral for business lending.</p>", "<p>Many households had increased their liquidity buffers in 2020. This reflected a reduction in living\n\t\t\t\texpenses and, more so for some renting households, an increase in income from government payments. In\n\t\t\t\tthe early 1990s' recession the unemployment rate had increased by less for households with\n\t\t\t\tmortgages than for households that rent, but in 2020 the unemployment rate had increased by a similar\n\t\t\t\tamount for both types of households. The unemployment rate for households with mortgages, nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\tremained lower than for renters. Members noted that repayments had been deferred on around\n\t\t\t\t7 per cent of housing loans, a slight decline from the peak earlier in the year. Loans with a\n\t\t\t\trepayment deferral were more likely to have a higher loan-to-valuation ratio and to have been extended\n\t\t\t\tto those employed in industries relatively more adversely affected by the pandemic. Demand for housing\n\t\t\t\thad moderated slightly, with only relatively small falls in housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\t\t\t\tHousing prices had increased in all other cities in September. Most borrowers for housing had large\n\t\t\t\tamounts of equity in their properties, with only 3 per cent of borrowers estimated to have\n\t\t\t\tnegative equity.</p>", "<p>Banks in Australia had increased their provisions in the first half of 2020 to account for expected\n\t\t\t\tfuture losses resulting from the pandemic. Banks' non-performing loan ratio was low, but had been\n\t\t\t\tincreasing gradually since the start of the year. This had reflected a decline in credit quality for\n\t\t\t\thousing loans to both owner-occupiers and investors. The increase in the non-performing loan ratio for\n\t\t\t\tpersonal lending was partly due to a reduction in outstanding personal credit, particularly credit card\n\t\t\t\tbalances, as those borrowers in a stronger financial position had been repaying their debts. Both large\n\t\t\t\tand small banks had high levels of capital. Stress tests of the banks indicated they had sufficient\n\t\t\t\tcapital to withstand an economic contraction that was far more severe than expected. Members noted that,\n\t\t\t\tgiven their strong balance sheets, banks were well placed to continue lending and thereby support the\n\t\t\t\teconomic recovery.</p>"], "International Financial Markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of international financial markets by noting that financial\n\t\t\t\tconditions had continued to support the global economy over the preceding month. Central banks in the\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies had left their policy rates unchanged, but financial market prices implied that some\n\t\t\t\tcentral banks were expected to ease policy further. In the case of some central banks, such as the\n\t\t\t\tEuropean Central Bank, this was in response to weaker-than-expected economic conditions and rising\n\t\t\t\tdownside risks to the economic outlook. In the case of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Bank of\n\t\t\t\tEngland, the expectation of further easing had followed guidance from these central banks that they were\n\t\t\t\tpreparing for the possibility of negative policy rates.</p>", "<p>Central banks in the advanced economies had also continued to purchase substantial amounts of\n\t\t\t\tgovernment debt in the secondary markets. At its September meeting, the US Federal Reserve had left the\n\t\t\t\tpace of asset purchases unchanged, but acknowledged that asset purchases were being undertaken to foster\n\t\t\t\taccommodative financial conditions, in addition to sustaining market functioning.</p>", "<p>Low policy rates and large asset purchase programs had contributed to sovereign bond yields in major\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies remaining low and stable. Members noted that longer-term yields for Australian\n\t\t\t\tGovernment Securities (AGS) had been higher than in almost all other advanced economies, although there\n\t\t\t\thad been some narrowing of the interest rate differential between Australia and other major advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies in recent weeks. The recent narrowing in yield differentials had contributed to a broad-based\n\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the Australian dollar over the previous month, as had an increase in risk aversion and a\n\t\t\t\tdecline in some commodity prices, which had been related to rising concerns about the prospects for\n\t\t\t\tglobal output growth. Nevertheless, the Australian dollar had remained just below its peak of the\n\t\t\t\tprevious few years. While members noted that the Australian dollar exchange rate was broadly consistent\n\t\t\t\twith its fundamental determinants, a lower exchange rate would provide more stimulus to the Australian\n\t\t\t\teconomy in the recovery phase.</p>", "<p>In emerging markets, financial conditions had also been supported by accommodative policy settings.\n\t\t\t\tFinancial conditions in China had remained broadly accommodative, although they had tightened in recent\n\t\t\t\tmonths together with the economic recovery there. Growth in total social financing had remained stronger\n\t\t\t\tthan the previous year, consistent with the stated goal of the authorities. The Chinese renminbi had\n\t\t\t\tappreciated over the preceding couple of months. However, other emerging market economies had remained\n\t\t\t\tvulnerable to a further deterioration in their economic outlook because of the ongoing increase in <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases, pre-existing macroeconomic fragilities and a reliance on external\n\t\t\t\tfinancing, which limited the scope for additional fiscal stimulus.</p>"], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["<p>Domestically, the Bank's policy measures had continued to underpin accommodative financial\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions. Financial market prices implied that investors now expected the cash rate to decline to\n\t\t\t\t\tbelow 10 basis points, compared with earlier expectations that the cash rate would remain at\n\t\t\t\t\taround its current level of 13 basis points for some time. Money market rates and bond yields had\n\t\t\t\t\talso declined in line with this change in market expectations.</p>", "<p>The Bank had purchased bonds in the secondary market in early September in support of the 3-year AGS\n\t\t\t\t\tyield target. Subsequently, the 3-year yield had moved well below 20 basis points as market\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipants' expectations for further policy actions by the Bank had increased. Members noted\n\t\t\t\t\tthat investor demand for recent AGS issuance had been strong and that spreads of semi-government yields\n\t\t\t\t\tto AGS had remained narrow.</p>", "<p>Members also noted that banks had drawn down nearly all of their initial allowances of\n\t\t\t\t\t$84 billion from the Term Funding Facility by the 30 September deadline. This was supporting\n\t\t\t\t\thistorically low bank funding costs. From the start of October, banks were able to draw on the new\n\t\t\t\t\tsupplementary allowance of $57 billion in total, as well as additional allowances, which amounted\n\t\t\t\t\tto $59 billion at the time of the meeting.</p>", "<p>Interest rates on housing and business loans remained historically low. Business credit had decreased\n\t\t\t\t\ta little further in August as large businesses continued to repay revolving credit facilities, which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey had drawn down in March and April for precautionary purposes. Members noted that, notwithstanding\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, large businesses had issued more corporate bonds over the year to date than the average of recent\n\t\t\t\t\tyears, as had been the case in other economies. Large businesses had also increased their credit limits\n\t\t\t\t\tat banks. Meanwhile, lending to small and medium-sized businesses had remained little changed. Weakness\n\t\t\t\t\tin business credit growth appeared to be driven mostly by lower demand in response to weak economic\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions and the uncertain environment, although the availability of credit to businesses had also\n\t\t\t\t\ttightened a little following the onset of the pandemic.</p>", "<p>Growth in credit for owner-occupied housing had remained steady in recent months. Commitments for\n\t\t\t\t\thousing loans to owner-occupiers had picked up further in August across all states, consistent with a\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral increase in activity in the housing market. By contrast, credit to investors in housing had\n\t\t\t\t\tremained weak, although it had stopped declining in August. Following an earlier tightening in response\n\t\t\t\t\tto the pandemic, more recently constraints on the supply of housing finance had eased slightly.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global economy was gradually recovering,\n\t\t\t\tbut that most economies were still some way from the output levels that prevailed before the pandemic.\n\t\t\t\tThe continuation of the recovery was dependent on containment of the virus. The recovery was most\n\t\t\t\tadvanced in China, where conditions had improved substantially over preceding months. Globally,\n\t\t\t\tinflation remained very low and below central bank targets.</p>", "<p>The Australian economy had experienced the largest peacetime economic contraction since the 1930s.\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, members noted that the decline in output in the June quarter had been smaller than in most\n\t\t\t\tother countries and smaller than had been expected. A recovery was under way in most of Australia,\n\t\t\t\talthough the second <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> outbreak in Victoria and associated\n\t\t\t\trestrictions on activity had been having a major effect on the economy in that state. Labour market\n\t\t\t\tconditions had improved somewhat over the preceding few months, with the unemployment rate likely to\n\t\t\t\tpeak at a lower rate than earlier expected. Nevertheless, both unemployment and underemployment were\n\t\t\t\texpected to remain high for an extended period. The recovery was likely to be slow and uneven, and\n\t\t\t\tinflation was expected to remain subdued for some time.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the Board's policy package was continuing to support the Australian economy by\n\t\t\t\tunderpinning very low borrowing costs and the supply of credit to households and businesses. There was a\n\t\t\t\tvery high level of liquidity in the Australian financial system and the policy package had helped to\n\t\t\t\tlower funding costs. Authorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $83 billion of low-cost\n\t\t\t\tfunding through the Term Funding Facility and had access to a further $114 billion under the\n\t\t\t\tfacility. Members noted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital and liquidity\n\t\t\t\tbuffers, had remained resilient and was helping the economy traverse the current difficult period.</p>", "<p>Over the prior month, the Bank had purchased AGS in support of the Board's 3-year yield target of\n\t\t\t\taround 25 basis points. Government bond markets had been operating effectively, also during a\n\t\t\t\tperiod of significant increase in issuance. The Bank stood ready to purchase AGS and semi-government\n\t\t\t\tsecurities in the event of a recurrence of market dysfunction.</p>", "<p>Members recognised that the substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary\n\t\t\t\tpolicy in Australia was helping to sustain the economy through the current period. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\tpublic sector balance sheets in Australia were strong, which allowed for the provision of continued\n\t\t\t\tsupport, with the Australian Government Budget for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> to be\n\t\t\t\tannounced that evening. The Secretary to the Australian Treasury briefed members on the main features of\n\t\t\t\tthe Budget. Members considered that fiscal and monetary support would be required for some time given\n\t\t\t\tthe outlook for the economy and the prospect of high unemployment.</p>", "<p>The Board discussed the case for additional monetary easing to support jobs and the overall economy. As\n\t\t\t\tin previous meetings, members discussed the options of reducing the targets for the cash rate and the\n\t\t\t\t3-year yield towards zero, without going negative, and buying government bonds further along the yield\n\t\t\t\tcurve. These options would have the effect of further easing financial conditions in Australia.</p>", "<p>In considering the case for further monetary measures, members discussed monetary policy developments\n\t\t\t\tabroad and their implications for financial conditions in Australia, through the yield curve and the\n\t\t\t\texchange rate. Members noted that the larger balance sheet expansions by other central banks relative to\n\t\t\t\tthe Reserve Bank was contributing to lower sovereign yields in most other advanced economies than in\n\t\t\t\tAustralia. Members discussed the implications of this for the Australian dollar exchange rate.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed how much traction further monetary easing might obtain in terms of better\n\t\t\t\teconomic outcomes. They recognised that some parts of the transmission of easier monetary policy had\n\t\t\t\tbeen impaired as a result of the restrictions on activity in parts of the economy. However, as the\n\t\t\t\teconomy opens up, members considered it reasonable to expect that further monetary easing would gain\n\t\t\t\tmore traction than had been the case earlier. Members also considered the effect of lower interest rates\n\t\t\t\ton community confidence and on those people who rely on interest income.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the possible effect of further monetary easing on financial stability. A further\n\t\t\t\teasing would help to reduce financial stability risks by strengthening the economy and private sector\n\t\t\t\tbalance sheets, thereby lowering the number of non-performing loans. This benefit would need to be\n\t\t\t\tweighed against any additional risks as investors search for yield in the low interest rate environment,\n\t\t\t\tincluding those resulting from higher leverage and higher asset prices, particularly in the housing\n\t\t\t\tmarket. On balance, the Board thought it likely that there were greater financial stability benefits\n\t\t\t\tfrom a stronger economy, while acknowledging that risks in asset markets had to be closely\n\t\t\t\tmonitored.</p>", "<p>The Board also considered the nature of the forward guidance regarding the cash rate. Over recent\n\t\t\t\tmonths, the Board had communicated that it would ‘not increase the cash rate target until\n\t\t\t\tprogress is being made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation will be sustainably\n\t\t\t\twithin the 2–3 per cent target band’. Given the higher level of uncertainty\n\t\t\t\tabout inflation dynamics in the current economic environment, the Board agreed to place more weight on\n\t\t\t\tactual, not forecast, inflation in its decision-making. Members indicated that they would also like to\n\t\t\t\tsee more than just progress towards full employment before considering an increase in the cash rate, as\n\t\t\t\tthe Board views addressing the high rate of unemployment as an important national priority. Members\n\t\t\t\trecognised that while inflation can move up and down for a range of reasons, achieving inflation\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with the target is likely to require a return to a tight labour market.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that this evolution in forward guidance would best be announced in a speech by the\n\t\t\t\tGovernor on 15 October. This would allow for greater context to be provided than was possible in\n\t\t\t\tthe post-meeting statement. The Board remains of the view that it would be appropriate to remove the\n\t\t\t\tyield target before the cash rate itself is raised.</p>", "<p>The Board affirmed its commitment to supporting jobs, incomes and businesses in Australia. Its actions,\n\t\t\t\tincluding the decision in September to expand the Term Funding Facility, were keeping funding costs low\n\t\t\t\tand assisting with the supply of credit. It agreed to maintain highly accommodative policy settings as\n\t\t\t\tlong as required and to continue to consider how additional monetary easing could support jobs as the\n\t\t\t\teconomy opens up further.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:</p>"]}},

GDP outcomes in major economies in the September quarter had generally been somewhat better\n\t\t\t\t\tthan expected after very large declines in activity in the first half of the year. In China, where the\n\t\t\t\t\trecovery was most advanced, and in some other Asian economies where health outcomes had been relatively\n\t\t\t\t\tfavourable, the contraction in GDP earlier in the year had been largely or fully reversed. However, GDP\n\t\t\t\t\tin the September quarter in Europe and the United States remained well below pre-pandemic levels, even\n\t\t\t\t\tafter the rebound in the quarter, and this was expected to be the case for some time.</p>", "<p>Members emphasised that the global outlook continued to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main source of uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic, and the policy and behavioural\n\t\t\t\t\tresponses to it. Indicators suggested that the pace of the global recovery had faltered and was quite\n\t\t\t\t\tuneven. The resurgence in new cases of the virus in recent weeks threatened the recovery in some\n\t\t\t\t\teconomies, notably in Europe.</p>", "<p>In their discussion of global labour markets, members noted that while recent trends in unemployment\n\t\t\t\t\trates had varied across economies, significant spare capacity was evident. To date, fiscal and monetary\n\t\t\t\t\tpolicy support had been effective in limiting the rise in recorded unemployment in some countries.\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, underemployment was still high and the recent upswing in new cases of the virus in the\n\t\t\t\t\tnorthern hemisphere could damage these economies' labour markets in the period ahead. Members\n\t\t\t\t\tnoted that, in these circumstances, substantial ongoing policy support would be needed.</p>", "<p>Trends in global commodity markets had been mixed and reflected a range of developments. Over the\n\t\t\t\t\tprior 6 months, the recovery in industrial production and fixed asset investment, particularly in\n\t\t\t\t\tChina, had supported the prices of base metals and iron ore. Supply disruptions in Brazil had also\n\t\t\t\t\tsupported higher iron ore prices through the year, although in recent months prices had retraced a\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle to be around 25 per cent higher since January. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot prices\n\t\t\t\t\thad fallen significantly in the first half of the year alongside a very sharp decline in oil prices,\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore rebounding strongly in recent months. A pick-up in demand, extended maintenance at some\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralian LNG facilities and disruptions to US supply had all contributed to this rebound. Meanwhile,\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal demand for thermal and coking coal had generally been subdued and prices were still around\n\t\t\t\t\t20 per cent below levels at the start of the year, following large declines in April.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Developments": ["<p>In reviewing the updated set of forecasts for the domestic economy, members noted that the outlook\n\t\t\t\t\tfor GDP in the near term had been revised up a little. They noted that, since the onset of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpandemic, consumption, business investment and labour market outcomes had generally been better than\n\t\t\t\t\tinitially feared, with significant policy support a key factor during and after the intensive period of\n\t\t\t\t\tlockdowns. However, the recovery in activity was expected to be modest in the context of the largest\n\t\t\t\t\tpeacetime contraction in GDP since the Great Depression, and members acknowledged that GDP was not\n\t\t\t\t\texpected to return to its pre-pandemic level until the end of 2021.</p>", "<p>A feature of the forecast profile was a significant further downward revision to expected population\n\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, in line with the updated projections in the Australian Government Budget, which had been\n\t\t\t\t\tannounced in October. These projections for population growth, of around 0.2 per cent in\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> and 0.4 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2021/22</span>, represented the lowest rates of growth since the First World War.</p>", "<p>Members considered 3 scenarios in their discussion of the outlook. In the baseline scenario, GDP\n\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was expected to contract by around 4 per cent over 2020, before growing by\n\t\t\t\t\t5 per cent over 2021 and by 4 per cent over 2022. This assumed no additional\n\t\t\t\t\tsignificant <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> outbreaks and that domestic activity restrictions\n\t\t\t\t\twould continue to be lifted, although restrictions on international travel would remain in place until\n\t\t\t\t\tthe end of 2021.</p>", "<p>Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, 2 alternative scenarios were considered,\n\t\t\t\t\tbased largely on different assumptions about health outcomes and restrictions on activity. A plausible\n\t\t\t\t\tdownside scenario involved further significant outbreaks of the virus in Australia and abroad. This\n\t\t\t\t\twould result in renewed lockdowns, further delays in the opening of international borders and a\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial deterioration in household and business confidence. The recovery would be substantially\n\t\t\t\t\tdelayed in this scenario, with the level of GDP still falling a little short of pre-pandemic levels by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe end of the forecast period in 2022. A stronger economic recovery than envisaged in the baseline\n\t\t\t\t\tscenario was also considered, where additional progress in the control of the virus is achieved,\n\t\t\t\t\tleading to a more rapid easing of restrictions and a faster rebound in confidence, private demand and\n\t\t\t\t\tservices exports. In this scenario, the level of GDP would exceed pre-pandemic levels in mid 2021\n\t\t\t\t\tand would be a couple of per cent higher than in the baseline scenario by the end of 2022.</p>", "<p>The starting point for these economic projections was a little higher than expected 3 months\n\t\t\t\t\tearlier, despite the expected effects of the restrictions in Victoria in the September and December\n\t\t\t\t\tquarters. Household cash flow and the rebound in consumption were seen as driving the recovery. Reduced\n\t\t\t\t\tconsumption possibilities as a result of restrictions on activity were important in driving the\n\t\t\t\t\t12 per cent decline in consumption in the June quarter. The subsequent easing in these\n\t\t\t\t\trestrictions was expected to underpin the recovery through to the end of the year and into 2021. Even\n\t\t\t\t\tso, consumption in the December quarter 2020 was expected to be around 5 per cent below the\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel of a year earlier.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the causes and implications of the unusually high rate of household saving in the\n\t\t\t\t\tJune quarter. The increase in savings had been due to limits on spending opportunities and strong\n\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in household disposable income, despite a sharp fall in employment and hours worked. The\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease in social assistance payments had been particularly important in supporting the growth in\n\t\t\t\t\tincomes during the pandemic. Households were expected to consume a larger share of their income in the\n\t\t\t\t\tperiod ahead as more opportunities for consumption became possible, and as some households felt a\n\t\t\t\t\treduced need to accumulate or maintain high levels of savings for precautionary reasons. This was\n\t\t\t\t\texpected to support overall economic activity through the period where household disposable income\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclined as a result of reduced social assistance payments and the expiry of other temporary support\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasures.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the substantial support for the economy announced in the Australian Government\n\t\t\t\t\tBudget. The positive net fiscal impact on the economy was projected to be the largest in many decades.\n\t\t\t\t\tForecasts for public consumption and investment, including infrastructure spending, had been upgraded.\n\t\t\t\t\tTax incentives for firms, such as accelerated depreciation allowances, had prompted an upward revision\n\t\t\t\t\tto the forecasts for business investment. Even so, high uncertainty and expectations of subdued demand\n\t\t\t\t\twere likely to restrain business spending over the forecast period.</p>", "<p>Turning to the housing market, members noted that prices had declined over recent months in Melbourne\n\t\t\t\t\tand, to a lesser extent, in Sydney. These declines had been smaller than those recorded in 2018.\n\t\t\t\t\tElsewhere, housing prices had generally increased in recent months. Housing loan commitments and price\n\t\t\t\t\ttrends across the country suggested that conditions in the detached housing market remained stronger\n\t\t\t\t\tthan in the apartment market; growth in rents for apartments remained weak in most cities.</p>", "<p>Members discussed recent developments in Australian trade volumes, noting that while services\n\t\t\t\t\taccounted for a smaller share of overall trade than goods, services trade had been particularly\n\t\t\t\t\taffected during the pandemic. The closure of international borders had led to sharp falls in tourism\n\t\t\t\t\timports and exports, and education exports had also been much lower. In cases where foreign students\n\t\t\t\t\twere studying online at Australian educational institutions but not physically in the country, this\n\t\t\t\t\twould generate fee income. However, these students would not be consuming other goods and services in\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralia; typically, this contributes a little more to education exports than fees.</p>", "<p>In their discussion of the labour market, members noted that conditions in the September quarter had\n\t\t\t\t\timproved and outcomes had been better than expected. But labour market conditions remained soft\n\t\t\t\t\toverall. In the month of September, outcomes had been mixed: employment had declined, led by\n\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in Victoria, while total hours worked had recovered a little further as the increase in\n\t\t\t\t\taverage hours worked had more than offset the decline in employment. Members observed that hours for\n\t\t\t\t\tpart-time workers had recovered to pre-pandemic levels, while many full-time workers were still on\n\t\t\t\t\treduced hours.</p>", "<p>Under the baseline scenario, the unemployment rate was forecast to increase to a little below\n\t\t\t\t\t8 per cent by the end of the year. This was higher than the 6.9 per cent rate of\n\t\t\t\t\tunemployment in September, but below the 10 per cent peak forecast 3 months earlier.\n\t\t\t\t\tWith employment expected to grow steadily and more people drawn back into the labour market over the\n\t\t\t\t\tforecast period, the unemployment rate was expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels through to the\n\t\t\t\t\tend of 2022. However, in the downside and upside scenarios, the unemployment rate could be\n\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly higher or lower than projected in the baseline forecast, depending largely on the\n\t\t\t\t\tevolution of the pandemic. Members noted a high degree of uncertainty is likely around unemployment\n\t\t\t\t\trate outcomes in the coming months as restrictions are eased in Victoria and temporary support policies\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the labour market are adjusted or expire. Members also discussed the high level of underemployment,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich highlighted that significant spare capacity remained in the labour market and that this was\n\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be the case for a considerable period.</p>", "<p>Members noted that spare capacity in the labour market had been weighing on wages and underlying\n\t\t\t\t\tinflation, and would continue to do so for some time. Headline inflation outcomes in the June and\n\t\t\t\t\tSeptember quarters had been volatile because of the introduction and subsequent removal of policy\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasures, especially the subsidy for child care and preschool, as well as large changes in fuel prices.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe effect of temporary policy changes was expected to persist into 2021, but to a lesser extent.\n\t\t\t\t\tBehavioural changes during the pandemic had also had a large effect on some prices; for instance,\n\t\t\t\t\tprices of consumer durables had been supported by unusually strong demand. But, overall, members\n\t\t\t\t\tconcurred that the outlook for inflation was very subdued. Both headline and trimmed mean inflation\n\t\t\t\t\twere forecast to bottom out below 1 per cent in 2021 before reaching\n\t\t\t\t\t1½ per cent by the end of 2022.</p>", "<p>Members briefly reviewed how the domestic economy had evolved over the preceding year relative to the\n\t\t\t\t\tBank's forecasts for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation, as had become the Board's\n\t\t\t\t\tpractice in preceding years. On this occasion, members acknowledged that economic growth had been well\n\t\t\t\t\tbelow what had been expected in the November 2019 forecasts, owing to the extraordinary economic\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraction following the onset of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> pandemic. While a global\n\t\t\t\t\tpandemic was a known risk, its timing could not be predicted. Members noted that new data sources and\n\t\t\t\t\tmethods, and extensive outreach with other agencies and liaison contacts, had played a valuable role in\n\t\t\t\t\tinforming the Bank's forecasts during the period of heightened uncertainty over preceding months.\n\t\t\t\t\tThese enhancements would assist the forecasting process in the future.</p>"], "International Financial Markets": ["<p>Members noted that global financial market conditions had remained very accommodative. Central banks\n\t\t\t\twere expected to maintain their highly accommodative policy settings for an extended period. Market\n\t\t\t\tpricing implied that some central banks, including the Bank of England, European Central Bank and\n\t\t\t\tReserve Bank of New Zealand, were expected to lower policy rates further in coming months.</p>", "<p>Central banks in most advanced economies had continued to purchase significant amounts of government\n\t\t\t\tdebt in secondary markets. Government bond yields had remained very low across advanced economies partly\n\t\t\t\tas a result of these purchases and despite strong issuance by governments. This issuance had also been\n\t\t\t\tmet by strong demand from private sector investors.</p>", "<p>Corporate funding conditions had remained favourable in advanced economies, including Australia. Debt\n\t\t\t\tissuance had eased – after firms had raised large amounts of funding earlier in the year –\n\t\t\t\tand spreads on corporate debt had remained low. The number of corporate defaults had subsided over\n\t\t\t\trecent months. Equity prices had declined from recent highs, following rising <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases in Europe and the United States. Nonetheless, the overall cost of\n\t\t\t\tequity had been low, which had supported high levels of equity issuance and corporate takeover\n\t\t\t\tactivity.</p>", "<p>In China, monetary policy had been less stimulatory than elsewhere because economic conditions had been\n\t\t\t\tmore favourable and policymakers had been seeking to balance risks to the economy against risks to\n\t\t\t\tfinancial stability. Aided by higher interest rates and portfolio inflows, the renminbi had appreciated\n\t\t\t\tnoticeably over the preceding few months.</p>"], "Domestic Financial Markets": ["<p>Domestically, in preceding weeks financial market participants had more strongly anticipated that the\n\t\t\t\t\tBank would announce further monetary policy measures. Specifically, the Bank was expected to: reduce\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate target, the 3-year Australian Government bond yield target and the interest rate on\n\t\t\t\t\tdrawings under the Term Funding Facility; reduce the interest rate paid on Exchange Settlement balances\n\t\t\t\t\tat the Bank; and implement a program of government bond purchases for the longer-maturity part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tyield curve (beyond the 3-year tenor).</p>", "<p>Members noted that, in response, yields on Australian Government Securities (AGS) had declined across\n\t\t\t\t\tthe curve. Yields on 10-year AGS had been high relative to the 10-year government bond yields of other\n\t\t\t\t\tadvanced countries. They also observed that this was partly because the holdings of government debt by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Bank were relatively low as a share of GDP. The 10-year AGS yield had declined relative to US\n\t\t\t\t\tTreasury yields as market expectations for a government bond purchase program in Australia had firmed.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe decline in Australian yields relative to those for other countries, along with lower commodity\n\t\t\t\t\tprices, had contributed to a depreciation of the Australian dollar of around 5 per cent since\n\t\t\t\t\tearly September. Meanwhile, Australian equity prices had outperformed major overseas equity indices\n\t\t\t\t\tover the preceding month.</p>", "<p>The Bank's policy actions to date had kept Australian banks' funding costs at historically\n\t\t\t\t\tlow levels and had supported the availability of credit to households and businesses. Deposit rates had\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclined noticeably in March and April, and had continued to decline since then. The share of deposits\n\t\t\t\t\tpaying interest rates close to zero had increased to be a little over one-quarter of the major\n\t\t\t\t\tbanks' (non-equity) funding, but a sizeable share of deposits was still paying rates of\n\t\t\t\t\t1 per cent or higher. Lending rates for both housing and business loans had also declined\n\t\t\t\t\tnoticeably following the Bank's package of measures in March and had gradually moved lower since\n\t\t\t\t\tthen.</p>", "<p>Demand for housing finance had increased a little further in September (outside Victoria) in line\n\t\t\t\t\twith the pick-up in some indicators of housing market activity. Growth in housing credit to\n\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers had risen a little, while credit to investors in housing had expanded only modestly\n\t\t\t\t\tafter having declined for much of the year. Some lenders had reversed some of the tightening in the\n\t\t\t\t\tavailability of housing finance that had occurred earlier in the pandemic, which had mostly reflected\n\t\t\t\t\tthe application of existing credit standards in the context of weaker economic conditions. By contrast,\n\t\t\t\t\tdemand for business credit had remained weak and credit supply had tightened since March. Lending to\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall and medium-sized businesses had been little changed, while lending to large businesses had\n\t\t\t\t\tretraced most of the sharp increase earlier in the year, as precautionary lines of credit had been\n\t\t\t\t\trepaid.</p>", "<p>Households had continued to pay off housing loans and increase balances in offset and redraw accounts\n\t\t\t\t\tat a faster rate than in early 2020, at the same time as lower interest rates had reduced their\n\t\t\t\t\tinterest payments. Personal credit had also continued to decline as households paid off their credit\n\t\t\t\t\tcard debts. Members noted that this behaviour was consistent with weak consumption growth and was\n\t\t\t\t\tlikely to have been facilitated by the government's income support programs as well as withdrawals\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom superannuation.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global economy had been recovering from\n\t\t\t\tthe initial virus outbreaks, with the recovery most advanced in China. Nevertheless, most economies were\n\t\t\t\tstill well short of the output levels that prevailed prior to the pandemic and the recent virus\n\t\t\t\toutbreaks posed a downside risk to the outlook, particularly in Europe. Globally, inflation remained\n\t\t\t\tvery low and below central bank targets.</p>", "<p>In Australia, economic activity had contracted substantially in the early months of the pandemic and\n\t\t\t\thad since recovered some of that decline. With the restrictions on activity in Victoria having been\n\t\t\t\tlifted, the near-term outlook had improved a little. Fiscal and monetary policy support had been\n\t\t\t\teffective in preserving many jobs and firms through the period of restrictions and the Australian\n\t\t\t\tGovernment Budget had provided further stimulus. Nevertheless, the recovery was still expected to be\n\t\t\t\tprotracted and the outlook remained dependent on successful containment of the virus. It would take some\n\t\t\t\ttime for output to reach its pre-pandemic level, and it had become increasingly clear that an extended\n\t\t\t\tperiod of high unemployment was in prospect. The high unemployment rate and excess capacity across the\n\t\t\t\teconomy more broadly were expected to result in subdued wages growth and inflation over coming\n\t\t\t\tyears.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the Board's policy measures were continuing to support the Australian economy\n\t\t\t\tby underpinning very low borrowing costs and the supply of credit to households and businesses. There\n\t\t\t\twas a very high level of liquidity in the Australian financial system and the mid-March policy package\n\t\t\t\thad helped to lower funding costs. Authorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down\n\t\t\t\t$83 billion of low-cost funding through the Term Funding Facility and had access to a further\n\t\t\t\t$104 billion under the facility. Members noted that the Australian banking system, with its strong\n\t\t\t\tcapital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping the economy traverse the current\n\t\t\t\tdifficult period.</p>", "<p>The Board discussed the outlook for the economy and concluded that, despite somewhat better recent\n\t\t\t\toutcomes in Australia, the recovery was expected to be protracted and uneven. The outlook implied a\n\t\t\t\tlarge shortfall in activity and employment from levels that would be consistent with full employment. To\n\t\t\t\tprovide additional support for the recovery and complement the significant support from fiscal policy,\n\t\t\t\tthe Board resolved to introduce a further package of monetary measures, namely:</p>", "<p>Under the program to purchase longer-dated bonds, members agreed the Bank would purchase nominal\n\t\t\t\t\tbonds issued by the Australian Government and by the states and territories, with an expected <span class=\"no-wrap\">80/20</span> split. These bonds would be purchased in the secondary market through\n\t\t\t\t\tregular auctions conducted by the Bank, with the first auction to be conducted on 5 November. The\n\t\t\t\t\tBank would not purchase bonds directly from the government, and so the purchase of bonds by the Bank\n\t\t\t\t\twould not constitute government financing. The longstanding separation of monetary policy and fiscal\n\t\t\t\t\tfinancing in Australia would therefore remain in place. The Australian Government and the states and\n\t\t\t\t\tterritories fund themselves in the market and their bond auctions had been heavily oversubscribed over\n\t\t\t\t\trecent months, notwithstanding the significant increase in the size of these auctions.</p>", "<p>The Bank remained prepared to purchase bonds in whatever quantity is required to achieve the 3-year\n\t\t\t\t\tyield target. Any bonds the Bank needs to purchase to support the 3-year yield target would be in\n\t\t\t\t\taddition to the $100 billion program.</p>", "<p>In considering the case for the further monetary measures, the Board recognised that the complementary\n\t\t\t\tnature of the measures meant that it would be desirable for them to be implemented as a package. In\n\t\t\t\tparticular, interest rates further along the yield curve capture expectations about the path of\n\t\t\t\tshort-term rates, so lowering short-term rates would also lower rates at the long end of the yield\n\t\t\t\tcurve. The Board concluded that the combination of government bond purchases and lower interest rates\n\t\t\t\tacross the yield curve would assist the recovery by lowering financing costs for borrowers; contributing\n\t\t\t\tto a lower exchange rate than otherwise; and supporting asset prices, which would help to strengthen\n\t\t\t\tbalance sheets.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the merits of targeting a bond yield around 5 years but decided against this and\n\t\t\t\tto continue with the 3-year yield target. Members judged that a yield target is most effective when its\n\t\t\t\tmaturity is consistent with the Board's forward guidance on the cash rate. The Board expects the\n\t\t\t\tcash rate to remain at its current level for at least 3 years, but beyond that members have less\n\t\t\t\tconfidence about the path of interest rates. Moreover, members acknowledged that other factors can have\n\t\t\t\ta greater influence on yields at longer horizons.</p>", "<p>Members considered whether to implement the package at this time or to wait for further information.\n\t\t\t\tThe Board concluded that it was the appropriate time to implement the package, as it had become clearer\n\t\t\t\tthat unemployment would remain high and inflation subdued for an extended period, and that further\n\t\t\t\tinformation in coming months was unlikely to change that assessment. The Board viewed addressing the\n\t\t\t\thigh rate of unemployment as an important national priority. The package would add to the substantial\n\t\t\t\tmonetary stimulus already provided earlier in the year and would complement the significant steps taken\n\t\t\t\tby the Australian Government, including in the recent Budget, to support jobs and growth. It was also\n\t\t\t\tlikely that having the various arms of policy all taking steps in the same direction would deliver a\n\t\t\t\tgreater impact than the sum of the individual parts. This would be especially so during a period in\n\t\t\t\twhich the economy is opening up and people are more willing and able to spend.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the effect of lower interest rates on those who rely on interest income and\n\t\t\t\tacknowledged the difficulties that low interest rates generate for these households. While the effect of\n\t\t\t\tmonetary easing falls unevenly across the community, in aggregate lower interest rates boost disposable\n\t\t\t\tincomes for the household sector, which stimulates spending and supports employment. Lower interest\n\t\t\t\trates also have broader stimulatory effects on the economy through other channels, including the\n\t\t\t\texchange rate and asset prices. Members noted that very low interest rates were a global phenomenon,\n\t\t\t\treflecting the high level of the supply of savings relative to the demand to use those savings to invest\n\t\t\t\tin productive capital. This had reduced returns for savers, particularly in low-risk assets.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the effect that the further monetary measures would have on financial and\n\t\t\t\tmacroeconomic stability. The further easing was expected to reduce financial stability risks by\n\t\t\t\tsupporting employment, private sector balance sheets and the broader economy. The Board weighed this\n\t\t\t\tbenefit against the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate environment,\n\t\t\t\tincluding risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing market. On\n\t\t\t\tbalance, the Board concluded that there were greater financial stability benefits from a stronger\n\t\t\t\teconomy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that, with the cash rate target at 10 basis points and the interest rate on\n\t\t\t\tExchange Settlement balances at zero, interest rates would have been lowered as far as it made sense to\n\t\t\t\tdo so in the current environment. They considered that there was little to be gained from short-term\n\t\t\t\tinterest rates moving into negative territory and continued to view a negative policy rate as\n\t\t\t\textraordinarily unlikely.</p>", "<p>Given the outlook for both employment and inflation, the Board considered that monetary and fiscal\n\t\t\t\tsupport will be required for some time. The Board remains committed to not increasing the cash rate\n\t\t\t\tuntil actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For this\n\t\t\t\tto occur, wages growth would have to be materially higher than recent levels. This would require\n\t\t\t\tsignificant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. Given the outlook, the Board does\n\t\t\t\tnot expect to increase the cash rate for at least 3 years. The Board remains of the view that it\n\t\t\t\twould be appropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself were increased.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that the focus over the period ahead will be the government bond purchase program. At\n\t\t\t\tits future meetings, the Board will closely monitor the effects of the bond purchases on the economy and\n\t\t\t\ton market functioning, as well as the evolving outlook for jobs and inflation. The Board is prepared to\n\t\t\t\tdo more if necessary.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board agreed on the following policy settings:</p>"]}},

The global economy had grown above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrend in 2018, although it had slowed in the second half of the year and the more recent data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had been received had been consistent with a continuation of slower global growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfourth quarter of 2018 and early 2019, particularly in the euro area and parts of Asia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNotwithstanding the slower growth in output, labour markets in the major advanced economies had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained tight and there had been ongoing signs of upward pressure on wages.

The delay\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin tariff increases previously scheduled for 1 March had generated some optimism that tensions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould ease. However, the increases in tariffs implemented in 2018 had continued to weigh on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade between the United States and China, and there had been spillover effects on some other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. Notably, a decline in Chinese imports, both to meet domestic demand and facilitate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texport production, had been apparent in export growth in the September quarter in east Asia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIntra-regional export growth had also eased, although exports from east Asia to the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies had been relatively resilient, and survey measures of new export orders in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teast Asia had declined sharply to be below average early in 2019. The prospect of further tariff\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases on automobile imports into the United States had received considerable media\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattention; Germany and Japan were likely to be particularly affected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the major advanced economies, GDP growth had diverged over 2018.

The gradual pick-up was projected to continue into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2019/20 for expenditure on buildings and structures. This projection was consistent with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level of non-residential construction work yet to be done, although building approvals for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential construction had declined over preceding months. Members noted that activity in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsegments of the commercial property sector had been quite strong. Some of the recent strength in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining investment had been in structures, which includes investment in roads and renewable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenergy, and this was expected to continue.

Overall, liaison with lenders\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that loan approval rates were little changed and that reduced demand from borrowers,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly investors, largely explained the slower growth in lending.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, members noted that there had been some reduction in the supply of credit as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending practices had been tightened over the previous year.

While these factors could affect the maximum amount\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffered to a borrower, only a small proportion of borrowers borrow up to their limits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that banks continued to compete for borrowers of high credit quality by offering\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower interest rates on new loans than those offered on existing loans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in business credit had remained robust, with both the major banks and other lenders\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving contributed to the growth over the preceding year, although the major banks account for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmaller share of business lending than before the onset of the global financial crisis. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved, however, that the growth in business lending had been entirely to large businesses,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith one estimate suggesting that lending to small businesses had declined slightly over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding year. There had been greater caution around lending to small businesses in response to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndustry. Lower housing prices had also reduced the value of collateral for loans to small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that interest rates in the Australian short-term money market had recently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined from the persistently high levels around the turn of the year, in line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in international markets, although they remained a little above their levels of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier years.

Banks' longer-term funding costs had declined a little over recent months, consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith lower long-term government bond yields, even though spreads on bank bonds had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the preceding year. Overall, the marginal cost of banks' wholesale funding had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little from 2018 levels, to be only slightly higher than in 2017.

Nonetheless, output growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained sufficient in most advanced economies for labour markets to remain tight, putting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupward pressure on wages. Members noted the tension in a number of economies between slower GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and resilient labour markets. The transmission of tighter labour market conditions to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation pressures was taking longer than might be expected, based on historical experience.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe authorities had responded to slowing growth in China by putting in place policies to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease the flow of credit to the private sector and easing fiscal policy in a targeted way to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport growth, while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSlowing growth in China and ongoing trade tensions had led to lower growth in global trade, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to be a source of uncertainty for the outlook for global growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe tightening of global financial conditions, associated with higher risk premiums required by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors around the turn of the year, had eased.

The terms of trade for Australia were expected to have remained above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir trough in early 2016 and the Australian dollar had remained within its narrow range of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent times.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, there continued to be tension between the ongoing improvement in labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata and the apparent slowing in the momentum of output growth in the second half of 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLeading indicators of conditions in the labour market, such as vacancies and hiring intentions,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpointed to further tightening in the labour market in the near term.

Growth in consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to be supported by an increase in growth in household disposable income. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere continued to be considerable uncertainty around the outlook for consumption given the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironment of declining housing prices in some cities, low growth in household income and high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt levels. Dwelling investment was expected to subtract from growth in output over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast period and, unless pre-sales volumes started to increase, this decline could be sharper\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan currently expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe process of adjustment in the housing market had continued. Housing prices in Sydney,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne and Perth had declined further, and turnover in the housing market had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly. Rent inflation had remained low across most of the country despite declines in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trental vacancy rates over the previous year, except in Sydney, where rental vacancy rates had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen increasing. Credit conditions had tightened for some borrowers and the demand for housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit had slowed noticeably as conditions in the housing market had changed.

While the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket had continued to strengthen, less progress had been made on inflation. Looking forward,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe central forecast scenario was still for growth in GDP of around 3 per cent over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2019 and a further decline in the unemployment rate to 4¾ per cent over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnext couple of years. This further reduction in spare capacity underpinned the forecast of a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradual pick-up in wage pressures and inflation.

However, members noted that significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainties around the forecasts remained, with scenarios where an increase in the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be appropriate at some point and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe appropriate.

This had been particularly evident in the manufacturing sector. Survey\n\t\t\t\tmeasures of conditions in the manufacturing sector had declined across a range of economies, although\n\t\t\t\tthey had ticked up in China in March. Slower external demand, especially from China, had continued to\n\t\t\t\tweigh on export growth and the manufacturing sectors in the trade-exposed economies of east Asia, Japan\n\t\t\t\tand the euro area. In east Asia, the electronics cycle had turned, which had affected the\n\t\t\t\tregion's exports as well as investment in those economies with sizeable semi-conductor\n\t\t\t\tsectors.</p>", "<p>Recent trade talks between the United States and China had taken on a somewhat more positive tone.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, the United States had also said it would consider imposing restrictions on automotive imports,\n\t\t\t\twhich would affect large car exporters, including Germany and Japan.</p>", "<p>In the major advanced economies, however, domestic demand conditions had remained positive, supported\n\t\t\t\tby an easing in financial conditions since the beginning of 2019, and were consistent with growth being\n\t\t\t\taround, or even above, potential. Underlying inflation had remained close to target in a number of\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies, but global headline inflation had declined since late 2018 because of the fall in\n\t\t\t\toil prices.</p>", "<p>Growth in consumption in the advanced economies had been supported by ongoing tightness in labour\n\t\t\t\tmarkets, which had led to an upward trend in wages growth over a number of years. In the United States,\n\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rate had remained below levels consistent with full employment and employers had been\n\t\t\t\tfinding it increasingly difficult to find suitable labour. Members observed that most sectors of the US\n\t\t\t\tlabour market had experienced strong conditions and the pick-up in wages growth had been most pronounced\n\t\t\t\tfor lower-income workers.</p>", "<p>In Japan, consumption was expected to be supported by a bring-forward of spending ahead of an increase\n\t\t\t\tin the consumption tax in October 2019, as well as ongoing tightness in the labour market. In the euro\n\t\t\t\tarea, the unemployment rate had been declining gradually and wage pressures had increased. However,\n\t\t\t\temployment intentions had eased in the euro area and, more sharply, in the United Kingdom in the context\n\t\t\t\tof ongoing uncertainty around Britain's exit from the European Union.</p>", "<p>The outlook for investment across the major advanced economies had been more mixed. In the United\n\t\t\t\tStates, investment indicators had eased a little but remained above average, while investment in the\n\t\t\t\teuro area had weakened further. Members noted that political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the\n\t\t\t\teuro area was weighing on investment in those economies. In Japan, survey measures suggested that\n\t\t\t\tbusiness conditions would remain strong despite a prospective moderation in investment growth.</p>", "<p>In China, growth in domestic demand had slowed. At its March meeting, the National People's\n\t\t\t\tCongress had set a target of 6–6.5 per cent for growth in output in 2019, which was\n\t\t\t\tbelow the target of around 6.5 per cent in 2018. Members noted signs that stimulus measures\n\t\t\t\timplemented by the authorities over recent months were having an impact: growth in total social\n\t\t\t\tfinancing had increased a little, after slowing over the preceding year, and growth in infrastructure\n\t\t\t\tinvestment and retail spending had recovered. Residential construction activity had also increased.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, some recent indicators of production and investment in the manufacturing sector, which is more\n\t\t\t\texposed to external demand, had been subdued. Exports from China to the United States had continued to\n\t\t\t\tdecline, but China's imports from the United States had increased a little over the first few\n\t\t\t\tmonths of 2019, after an earlier sharp decline.

The terms of trade were expected to have increased further in the\n\t\t\t\tMarch quarter, although commodity price developments had been mixed since the previous meeting. Bulk\n\t\t\t\tcommodity prices had been little changed because falls in coal prices had been largely offset by an\n\t\t\t\tincrease in iron ore prices. Oil prices had risen, but were still 20 per cent below their\n\t\t\t\trecent peak in October 2018. Reflecting oil price movements in late 2018, liquefied natural gas (LNG)\n\t\t\t\tprices were expected to have declined over the first quarter of 2019. Other commodity prices had been\n\t\t\t\tlittle changed over the previous month.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by observing that growth had slowed markedly\n\t\t\t\tin the second half of 2018 compared with the first half. GDP had increased by 0.2 per cent in\n\t\t\t\tthe December quarter and by 2.3 per cent over the year, which was below the forecasts\n\t\t\t\tpresented in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. The soft December quarter outcome\n\t\t\t\tpartly reflected another weak quarter of consumption growth and a larger-than-expected fall in dwelling\n\t\t\t\tinvestment. It also reflected some temporary factors, such as the weather-related disruption to resource\n\t\t\t\texports and the effect of the drought. Public demand and non-mining investment had supported output\n\t\t\t\tgrowth. Members noted that the income-based measure of GDP growth had been particularly weak over the\n\t\t\t\tpreceding year, while the expenditure-based measure had been stronger.</p>", "<p>Growth in consumption had clearly slowed in the second half of 2018. The weakness had been concentrated\n\t\t\t\tin discretionary items, especially those that have historically been most correlated with housing prices\n\t\t\t\tand housing turnover, such as motor vehicles and home furnishings. Retail sales data and contacts in the\n\t\t\t\tBank's liaison program suggested that growth in housing-related consumption had remained soft in\n\t\t\t\trecent months.</p>", "<p>Members noted that growth in household disposable income, which is an important driver of consumption\n\t\t\t\tgrowth, had been subdued for a number of years. In 2018, labour income growth had been above the very\n\t\t\t\tlow rates seen in recent years, supported by a pick-up in growth in average hourly earnings and\n\t\t\t\tcontinued employment growth, but non-labour income growth had remained weak. Members observed that tax\n\t\t\t\tpayments by households had been growing noticeably faster than income growth in recent years, partly\n\t\t\t\tbecause of efforts to increase tax compliance.</p>", "<p>Dwelling investment appeared to have passed its peak, although there continued to be uncertainty about\n\t\t\t\thow quickly dwelling investment might decline over the forecast period. Construction of new dwellings\n\t\t\t\thad contracted in the second half of 2018; the largest falls in the December quarter had been for\n\t\t\t\tapartments in New South Wales and detached housing in Queensland. Slower housing activity had also\n\t\t\t\tweighed on the incomes of some building contractors and property professionals in the December quarter.\n\t\t\t\tThere continued to be a large amount of work in the pipeline, which should support a relatively high\n\t\t\t\tlevel of building activity in the near term. Members noted that there had been a substantial rise in\n\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals for high-density residential projects in February, although this series was volatile\n\t\t\t\tand in trend terms remained well below earlier peaks. Members also noted that population growth was\n\t\t\t\texpected to continue to support demand for housing over the medium term.</p>", "<p>Conditions in the established housing market had remained weak in recent months. Housing prices had\n\t\t\t\tcontinued to fall in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, and had declined a little in most other capital cities\n\t\t\t\tand regional areas. In March, Sydney prices were 13 per cent below their 2017 peak and\n\t\t\t\tMelbourne prices were 10 per cent below their peak. Although auction clearance rates in Sydney\n\t\t\t\tand Melbourne had increased over the first quarter of 2019, they remained at relatively low levels.\n\t\t\t\tMembers noted that in Perth, housing prices had declined over the previous year, while the rental\n\t\t\t\tvacancy rate had declined sharply and there were signs that newly advertised rents were starting to\n\t\t\t\tincrease. By contrast, rental vacancies in Sydney had risen, particularly in suburbs where the supply of\n\t\t\t\tnew apartments had increased significantly.</p>", "<p>Non-mining business investment had grown solidly in the December quarter, with non-residential\n\t\t\t\tconstruction having made the largest contribution to growth in the quarter, driven partly by strong\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in private sector infrastructure projects, such as roads and renewable energy. Forward-looking\n\t\t\t\tindicators, such as the substantial amount of work still to be done on private infrastructure projects,\n\t\t\t\tthe relatively high level of non-residential building approvals and positive business investment\n\t\t\t\tintentions, pointed to further growth in non-mining business investment. Survey measures of business\n\t\t\t\tconditions had declined in late 2018, but had stabilised at above-average levels.</p>", "<p>Mining activity had subtracted from growth in the second half of 2018, mainly reflecting ongoing\n\t\t\t\tdeclines in mining investment as remaining LNG projects approached completion. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\tinvestment required to sustain capacity and recently announced expansion projects were expected to\n\t\t\t\tsupport stronger mining investment over the medium term. Declines in resource exports, partly related to\n\t\t\t\tsupply disruptions, had also subtracted from growth in the second half of 2018. Coal exports to China\n\t\t\t\thad declined by 20 per cent, partly as a result of weather-related disruptions. The longer\n\t\t\t\ttime taken for imports of coal to clear Chinese customs in recent months was also likely to have played\n\t\t\t\ta role. Liaison contacts had reported that they expected to continue to be able to redirect coal\n\t\t\t\tshipments intended for China to other destinations. Members noted that there had been some disruptions\n\t\t\t\tto iron ore shipments as a result of Tropical Cyclone Veronica, which were likely to have affected iron\n\t\t\t\tore export volumes in March.</p>", "<p>The ongoing effects of the drought had weighed on farm output and income in the December quarter, and\n\t\t\t\trural exports had declined; farm GDP had fallen by more than 6 per cent over the second half\n\t\t\t\tof 2018. Based on the latest estimates from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics\n\t\t\t\tand Sciences, farm production was expected to improve gradually in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span>\n\t\t\t\tassuming rainfall returned to average levels. This was a more favourable outlook than had been assumed\n\t\t\t\tin the forecasts presented in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. However, members\n\t\t\t\tnoted that shortages of water in the Murray-Darling Basin had been severe and that it would take\n\t\t\t\tsignificant rainfall to increase soil moisture content from current low levels in this region.</p>", "<p>Public demand had contributed strongly to GDP growth over 2018, supported by spending on the National\n\t\t\t\tDisability Insurance Scheme and aged care and health services, and investment in infrastructure. Members\n\t\t\t\tnoted that, despite this, the overall fiscal impact on the economy had been negative because of slow\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in some other forms of government expenditure and strong growth in tax revenues.</p>", "<p>The labour market had continued to improve in early 2019, despite the slowing in growth recorded in the\n\t\t\t\tnational accounts through 2018. Employment had increased a little in February, following strong growth\n\t\t\t\tin January, and the unemployment rate had declined to 4.9 per cent, continuing the run of\n\t\t\t\tmonths with an unemployment rate at or around 5 per cent. Other measures of spare capacity,\n\t\t\t\tincluding the underemployment rate and the long-term unemployment rate, had also trended downwards. The\n\t\t\t\tparticipation rate had been relatively stable at a high level over the preceding year or so.</p>", "<p>Employment growth over the previous year had been particularly strong in the health care &amp; social\n\t\t\t\tassistance, professional services and construction industries. Over the same period,\n\t\t\t\temployment-to-population ratios had increased further in New South Wales and Victoria, where\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rates had been around historically low levels. Employment-to-population ratios had declined\n\t\t\t\ta little in other states more recently. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand had been mixed in\n\t\t\t\trecent months.

This was consistent with guidance from major central banks that\n\t\t\t\tmonetary policy would remain more accommodative than earlier expected, given downward revisions to\n\t\t\t\tgrowth forecasts and little upside risk to inflation despite increasingly tight labour markets.</p>", "<p>At its March meeting, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had kept the federal funds rate\n\t\t\t\tunchanged and announced that the decline in the Federal Reserve's asset holdings would slow from\n\t\t\t\tMay and cease after September, which was sooner than had been expected. The FOMC also published the\n\t\t\t\tquarterly update of its members' projections for where they believed the federal funds rate was\n\t\t\t\tlikely to be in coming years. These projections implied that the federal funds rate was likely to remain\n\t\t\t\tunchanged throughout the rest of 2019, followed by one increase (of 25 basis points) in 2020. By\n\t\t\t\tcontrast, at the time of the December 2018 meeting, the median FOMC projection had been for two rate\n\t\t\t\tincreases in 2019 and one in 2020. Policy expectations implied by financial market pricing had also been\n\t\t\t\trevised down since December. These implied that the next move in the federal funds rate was expected to\n\t\t\t\tbe down.</p>", "<p>In the euro area and Japan, financial market pricing indicated that policy rates were expected to be\n\t\t\t\tmaintained at very low levels for an extended period, in line with recent statements by the respective\n\t\t\t\tcentral banks. In March, the European Central Bank had announced that it would roll over a long-term\n\t\t\t\tlending program to euro area banks. In Canada, New Zealand and Australia, financial market pricing\n\t\t\t\timplied that declines in policy rates were expected in the coming year or so.</p>", "<p>Members noted that 10-year government bond yields had declined noticeably across all major markets over\n\t\t\t\tthe preceding month. In some cases, including in Australia, yields had declined to historic lows. These\n\t\t\t\tdeclines had reflected lower expected paths for monetary policy, lower term premiums and, to varying\n\t\t\t\textents, lower inflation expectations. In Germany and Japan, long-term bond yields had again turned\n\t\t\t\tnegative, approaching the lows that had been reached in 2016. In the United States, long-term rates had\n\t\t\t\tmoved below some short-term rates for a brief period, with market commentators noting that past episodes\n\t\t\t\tof yield curve inversion had tended to precede recessions. At the same time, the recent decline in risk\n\t\t\t\tpremiums in credit and equity markets suggested financial market participants did not consider a\n\t\t\t\trecession to be likely.</p>", "<p>Members observed that financing conditions for corporations had improved. Corporate bond yields had\n\t\t\t\tmoved lower, reflecting the decline in government bond yields as well as a decline in spreads following\n\t\t\t\tincreases in late 2018. Non-financial firms had increased their bond issuance in 2019, particularly in\n\t\t\t\tthe US dollar high-yield sector. By contrast, issuance of leveraged loans had been more subdued, which\n\t\t\t\tpartly reflected an easing in investors' appetites for floating rate securities in response to\n\t\t\t\tthe lowering of policy rate expectations. Equity markets in the advanced economies had been little\n\t\t\t\tchanged in March, having previously rebounded from their sharp fall in late 2018.</p>", "<p>In China, equity markets had risen particularly sharply since the end of 2018, which was likely to have\n\t\t\t\treflected some easing in US–China trade tensions, as well as the authorities' stimulus\n\t\t\t\tmeasures. Growth in total social financing had increased a little in recent months, as the authorities\n\t\t\t\thad taken measures to encourage bond issuance. They had also encouraged banks to provide finance to\n\t\t\t\tsmaller private firms. To support this, the authorities had signalled additional targeted monetary\n\t\t\t\teasing for the period ahead. These changes had followed a slowing in the growth of total social\n\t\t\t\tfinancing over the preceding year or more as the authorities had taken measures to reduce non-bank\n\t\t\t\tlending, which had been an important source of funding for private firms, in order to reduce overall\n\t\t\t\trisks in the financial system.</p>", "<p>In other emerging markets, conditions had been relatively stable in 2019, although Argentina and Turkey\n\t\t\t\thad experienced renewed depreciation of their exchange rates in response to continued macro-financial\n\t\t\t\tand political risks in those economies.</p>", "<p>Members noted that there had been little change in major economies' foreign exchange markets\n\t\t\t\tover the preceding month. The Australian dollar had also been little changed, remaining at the lower end\n\t\t\t\tof its range of recent years. The strength in commodity prices and the terms of trade had been\n\t\t\t\tsupporting the exchange rate, while the continued decline in Australian government bond yields relative\n\t\t\t\tto those in other major markets had been working in the opposite direction.</p>", "<p>Growth in housing lending to owner-occupiers had slowed to 4¾ per cent in\n\t\t\t\tsix-month-ended annualised terms, although the monthly growth rate had increased slightly in February.\n\t\t\t\tGrowth in housing lending to investors remained at a very low level. Housing loan approvals were\n\t\t\t\tmaterially below the levels of a year earlier, but had also increased slightly in February, with the\n\t\t\t\tsmall uptick in approvals broadly based across types of borrowers. Members observed that the slowing in\n\t\t\t\thousing lending over the preceding year had been driven largely by weakness in demand, particularly from\n\t\t\t\tinvestors. There had also been some tightening in lending practices. Lenders continued to compete for\n\t\t\t\tborrowers of high credit quality by offering lower interest rates on new loans than typically paid on\n\t\t\t\texisting loans.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the major banks' funding costs had declined over the preceding couple of\n\t\t\t\tmonths. The cost of debt funding had declined as pressures had eased in short-term money markets and\n\t\t\t\tbank bond spreads had narrowed. Deposit rates had also continued to edge downwards.</p>", "<p>Funding conditions for Australian businesses more broadly were accommodative. Three-year bond yields\n\t\t\t\tfor corporations across all major sectors had declined to record lows, reflecting the decline in both\n\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields and spreads. Bond issuance by non-financial corporations in the first quarter of\n\t\t\t\t2019 had been in line with that of recent years. Growth in bank lending to businesses had remained\n\t\t\t\trobust, in part reflecting increased lending by the major banks, although other institutions had\n\t\t\t\taccounted for most of the growth. Members observed that the growth in business lending had been entirely\n\t\t\t\tto large businesses. Meanwhile, credit conditions for some small businesses were reported to have\n\t\t\t\ttightened further recently.</p>", "<p>Financial market participants' expectations of a rate cut had been brought forward following\n\t\t\t\tweaker than expected data, most notably the December quarter national accounts. Financial market pricing\n\t\t\t\timplied that the cash rate was expected to be lowered in the second half of 2019 and then again in\n\t\t\t\t2020.</p>"], "Financial Stability": ["<p>Members were briefed on the Bank's regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system.\n\t\t\t\tOverall, members noted that financial stability risks were slightly higher than six months earlier but\n\t\t\t\twere not especially elevated.</p>", "<p>Globally, investors were receiving little compensation for taking on risk. Notably, risk-free rates\n\t\t\t\twere very low and the term premium in the United States had briefly turned negative. Furthermore,\n\t\t\t\tcorporate bond spreads remained low. These conditions had contributed to the significant increase in\n\t\t\t\tborrowing by businesses since the global financial crisis. However, members noted that debt servicing\n\t\t\t\tcosts had not increased to the same extent, given the decline in interest rates over this period. The\n\t\t\t\thigh prices of a range of assets in this environment meant that there was heightened risk of an abrupt\n\t\t\t\trepricing in response to news.</p>", "<p>Members observed that the profitability of banks globally had generally increased. In part, this\n\t\t\t\treflected above-trend economic growth in the first half of 2018. However, some European banks remained\n\t\t\t\tfragile, given large stocks of non-performing loans, high cost structures and overcapacity. The large\n\t\t\t\tstock of sovereign debt held by some European banks, along with concerns about sovereign debt\n\t\t\t\tsustainability, raised potential issues about the resilience of some banking systems.</p>", "<p>In China, the authorities had taken measures to contain risks in the financial system. As a result, the\n\t\t\t\tpace of growth in debt had slowed to below the pace of growth in the economy. However, given the earlier\n\t\t\t\trapid growth in debt, China's ratio of non-financial debt to GDP remained higher than in other\n\t\t\t\teconomies with comparable income and even higher than in many high-income economies. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\tthe earlier rapid growth in debt had also raised concerns about the lending standards under which those\n\t\t\t\tloans had been made.</p>", "<p>In Australia, conditions in the housing market had remained weak. Housing prices had fallen further in\n\t\t\t\tthe capital cities and regional areas. Over the preceding six months, the falls had been largest in\n\t\t\t\tSydney and Melbourne, but prices in these cities had remained more than 40 per cent higher\n\t\t\t\tthan in 2012. Falls in housing prices had resulted in some borrowers having negative equity, where the\n\t\t\t\tvalue of their loans exceeded that of their properties. Nationally, just over 2 per cent of\n\t\t\t\tborrowers, accounting for less than 3 per cent of housing debt, were estimated to have\n\t\t\t\tnegative equity. Around 90 per cent of these borrowers were in Queensland, Western Australia\n\t\t\t\tand the Northern Territory. Members observed that negative equity by itself was not a concern for\n\t\t\t\tfinancial stability. However, if unemployment were to rise and borrowers were not able to continue to\n\t\t\t\tmake repayments, then financial institutions would incur increased losses. Members noted that the\n\t\t\t\tdecline in high loan-to-valuation ratio (LVR) lending in recent years was expected to lessen any losses\n\t\t\t\tfor lenders. In recent quarters, almost all loans to investors had LVRs less than 90 per cent.\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, a decade earlier only 85 per cent of loans to investors had LVRs less than\n\t\t\t\t90 per cent. The share of owner-occupiers with high LVR loans had also declined.</p>", "<p>Members noted that total household payments on housing debt as a share of income had been broadly\n\t\t\t\tstable in recent years. Within the total, however, an increase in scheduled principal repayments had\n\t\t\t\troughly offset a fall in unscheduled principal repayments. Members noted that households' excess\n\t\t\t\tpayments amounted to about two-and-a-half years' worth of scheduled repayments on average.\n\t\t\t\tHousing loan interest payments had increased slightly as housing debt had increased.</p>", "<p>Banks' assets had continued to perform well overall. Although banks' non-performing\n\t\t\t\thousing loans had increased, they remained low at less than 1 per cent of their total housing\n\t\t\t\tlending. Members noted that the increase in housing loan arrears had been driven by loans remaining in\n\t\t\t\tarrears for longer, on average. Banks' business loans had been performing well, with\n\t\t\t\tnon-performing loan rates around their lowest levels in a decade. Banks had continued to accumulate\n\t\t\t\tcapital, with the capital ratios of the four major banks all exceeding or close to the\n\t\t\t\t‘unquestionably strong’ benchmarks set out by the Australian Prudential Regulation\n\t\t\t\tAuthority (APRA).</p>", "<p>The tightening in banks' housing lending practices over recent years had been accompanied by an\n\t\t\t\tincrease in lending by non-banks, although this was still estimated to account for less than\n\t\t\t\t5 per cent of total housing credit. Members noted that, while not subject to prudential\n\t\t\t\tregulation by APRA, non-banks' housing lending is subject to responsible lending obligations. The\n\t\t\t\tavailable evidence suggested that the riskiness of non-bank housing lending had not increased.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the International Monetary Fund's Financial Sector Assessment Program report\n\t\t\t\ton the Australian financial system was generally positive about the resilience of domestic financial\n\t\t\t\tinstitutions and the quality of regulatory and supervisory oversight, but made several high-level\n\t\t\t\trecommendations for improving current arrangements.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that growth in the global economy had\n\t\t\t\tslowed over the second half of 2018 and into 2019. Trade tensions and political developments in Europe\n\t\t\t\tremained sources of uncertainty. At the same time, though, global financial conditions had eased in\n\t\t\t\tpreceding months and, in China, the authorities had provided targeted stimulus to support domestic\n\t\t\t\tgrowth. In a number of economies, continued strength in labour market data and moderating GDP growth\n\t\t\t\twere sending different signals about the momentum in economic activity. Members noted that this was also\n\t\t\t\tthe case in Australia. While the labour market had continued to improve in early 2019, GDP growth had\n\t\t\t\tslowed over 2018. Continued low growth in household disposable income and the adjustment in housing\n\t\t\t\tmarkets had weighed on household spending.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the sustained low level of interest rates over recent years had been supporting\n\t\t\t\teconomic activity and had contributed to progress in reducing the unemployment rate and returning\n\t\t\t\tinflation towards the midpoint of the target, albeit only gradually. The central scenario was for\n\t\t\t\tfurther gradual progress to be made on both unemployment and inflation. Members observed that a pick-up\n\t\t\t\tin growth in household disposable income was an important element of these forecasts. Given this outlook\n\t\t\t\tfor further progress towards the Bank's goals, members agreed that there was not a strong case\n\t\t\t\tfor a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Members recognised that it was not possible to fine-tune\n\t\t\t\toutcomes and that holding monetary policy steady would enable the Bank to be a source of stability and\n\t\t\t\tconfidence.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that inflation was likely to remain low for some time. Wages growth had remained low,\n\t\t\t\tthere continued to be strong competition in the retail sector and governments had been working to ease\n\t\t\t\tcost of living pressures, including through their influence on administered prices. In these\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances, members agreed that the likelihood of a scenario where the cash rate would need to be\n\t\t\t\tincreased in the near term was low.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the scenario where inflation did not move any higher and unemployment trended\n\t\t\t\tup, noting that a decrease in the cash rate would likely be appropriate in these circumstances. They\n\t\t\t\trecognised that the effect on the economy of lower interest rates could be expected to be smaller than\n\t\t\t\tin the past, given the high level of household debt and the adjustment that was occurring in housing\n\t\t\t\tmarkets. Nevertheless, a lower level of interest rates could still be expected to support the economy\n\t\t\t\tthrough a depreciation of the exchange rate and by reducing required interest payments on borrowing,\n\t\t\t\tfreeing up cash for other expenditure.</p>", "<p>Taking account of the further progress expected towards the Bank's goals, members assessed that\n\t\t\t\tit was appropriate to hold the cash rate steady. Looking forward, the Board will continue to monitor\n\t\t\t\tdevelopments, including how the current tensions between the domestic GDP and labour market data evolve,\n\t\t\t\tand set monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and achieve the inflation target\n\t\t\t\tover time.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.</p>"]}},

Members also observed that the outlook for China continued to be a significant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty for the global growth outlook, as were trade tensions, which had escalated again between the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States and China immediately prior to the meeting. Global financial conditions had become more\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative since the turn of the year. Members noted that this could lead to stronger growth than\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected, although there were still risks of events occurring that could lead to both tighter financial\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions and lower global growth.</p>", "<p>March quarter GDP growth had been stronger than expected in the United States and the euro area, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been quite weak in a number of trade-intensive economies in east Asia. The latest monthly data had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshown that growth in Chinese industrial production, fixed asset investment and total social financing\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased, suggesting momentum had picked up in response to targeted policy easing by the Chinese\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities. Conditions in Chinese property markets had also strengthened. Members noted that economic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentiment in China had improved since the beginning of the year, partly because small to medium-sized\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses were obtaining improved access to finance and government infrastructure spending was boosting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the sharp slowing in global trade had been related to slowing growth in China. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in the value of Chinese imports had been broadly based across regions, although the large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in the value of trade with the United States suggested that trade diversion as a result of new\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttariffs had also been a factor. Growth in China was expected to slow gradually over the forecast period\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the middle of 2021. This was expected to continue to weigh on external demand for trade-intensive\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies in east Asia and the euro area; recent data on export orders in east Asia had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued.</p>", "<p>Members discussed various longer-term policy initiatives in China, including policies on investment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabroad and modernisation of China's manufacturing sector. China's infrastructure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment abroad had served to support land and sea trade routes, although there had been some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenges that Chinese authorities had been addressing. Members also noted the authorities'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tefforts to promote innovation, particularly in China's technology sector, and to upgrade the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese manufacturing sector significantly.</p>", "<p>For some economies, the slowing in external demand had been accompanied by lower investment and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment intentions. In some east Asian economies in particular, including South Korea, the turn in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cycle in the global electronics industry had dampened exports and investment. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirms would also be less likely to commit to long-term investments given the uncertainty around the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevolution of international trade policy.</p>", "<p>In many economies, domestically focused sectors, such as services and retail trade, had been more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresilient than externally focused sectors. This was particularly the case in the advanced economies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere tight labour market conditions had supported growth in spending. Unemployment rates had remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround multi-decade lows in many advanced economies and wages growth had increased noticeably. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States and Japan, recent wage increases had been larger for low-wage earners than high-wage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearners.</p>", "<p>Core inflation had remained subdued in most economies and, following weaker inflation data in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States, was below target in the three major advanced economies.</p>", "<p>There had been some large movements in commodity prices over recent months. Iron ore prices had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained high as a result of supply disruptions in Brazil and Australia. Oil prices had also risen,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had led to higher headline consumer price inflation in most economies and was expected to flow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough to higher prices for Australian liquefied natural gas exports over the following couple of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarters. As a result, the forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised higher, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were still expected to decline over the forecast period to the middle of 2021.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that growth had been subdued in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe second half of 2018. Indicators of household consumption suggested that growth had remained subdued\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter. In addition, demand for new dwelling construction was expected to have remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak. These factors had been the main drivers of a downward revision to the domestic growth outlook in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe near term. Beyond 2019, these effects were broadly offset by upward revisions to export growth and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome newly announced mining investment projects. Members noted that, overall, the Bank expected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended GDP growth to be 2¾ per cent over 2019 and 2020.</p>", "<p>Growth in consumption had been weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 and retail sales data\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the March quarter suggested that this weakness had continued into 2019. Members noted that, as had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen the case for some time, the outlook for growth in consumption was a key uncertainty for the overall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth outlook. The risks to consumption were tilted to the downside, given the extended period of low\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome growth and the adjustment occurring in housing markets. The forecast for an improvement in growth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin consumption depended on an increase in growth in household disposable income over the forecast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod. The forecast increase in household disposable income growth was supported by employment growth,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta pick-up in wages growth and lower growth in tax payments, partly because of the introduction of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow- and middle-income tax offsets announced in the Australian Government 2019-20 Budget. Members noted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there was uncertainty about the outlook for fiscal policy and how this might affect the outlook for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in household disposable income.</p>", "<p>Housing markets had remained weak in the preceding month. The rental vacancy rate in Sydney had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased to the highest level in around 15 years and housing prices in established markets had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to decline. More positively, the pace of price declines had moderated and the modest recovery\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin auction clearance rates since the start of the year had been sustained.</p>", "<p>Information obtained through the Bank's liaison program continued to indicate that sales\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions for off-the-plan apartments and new detached housing had been difficult. The spike in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential building approvals in February had largely been unwound in March, confirming that underlying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions for new dwelling activity remained weak. Data released since the previous meeting had shown\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the pipeline of residential work to be done had decreased in the December quarter, but remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh. Members noted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the forecasts for dwelling investment suggested that population growth could exceed growth in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstock of housing towards the end of the forecast period, and that this possibility had been suggested by\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta number of the Bank's liaison contacts.</p>", "<p>Survey measures of business conditions had moved a little higher in March and April and had remained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly above average, though well below the high levels that had prevailed throughout most of 2018.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForward-looking indicators of non-mining business investment had been mixed; non-residential building\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprovals had declined, but the pipeline of infrastructure work remained high. Non-mining business\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was expected to support growth in output over the forecast period.</p>", "<p>Mining investment had declined in the December quarter, but was expected to increase over the forecast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, reflecting investment required to sustain current production levels and an expectation that a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of new projects would commence towards the end of the forecast period. Recent trade data\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested resource exports would contribute to output growth in the March quarter, and exports were\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to contribute to output growth throughout the forecast period. Members noted that the forecast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in rural exports from 2020 depended on a return to normal weather conditions.</p>", "<p>Public demand was expected to continue to support aggregate growth over the forecast period; a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant share of this expenditure was associated with delivering goods and services to households,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Members noted that the Victorian Government had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannounced measures to contain growth in labour costs in an environment of expected lower stamp duty\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevenues.</p>", "<p>Growth in employment in the March quarter had been strong, following similar outcomes over much of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018. Most of the growth in employment since mid 2018 had been in full-time employment. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had remained around 5 per cent in March. Members observed that conditions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe labour market had signalled a significantly stronger pace of economic activity since mid 2018\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan indicated by the GDP data. Leading indicators of labour demand had eased over recent months and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovided a mixed picture of the near-term outlook. As a result, employment growth was expected to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar to the growth rate of the working-age population in the near term. The unemployment rate was\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to remain around 5 per cent through most of the forecast period, before declining to\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 4¾ per cent in 2021.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the forecasts for the labour market suggested that there would be some spare\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity in the labour market throughout the forecast period, although there was uncertainty about how\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquickly the spare capacity would decline and how progress would feed into wage pressures. The central\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast was for wages growth to pick up gradually. In combination, the forecasts for wages growth and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumer price inflation implied that real consumer wage growth would be low but positive over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast period.</p>", "<p>The inflation data in the March quarter CPI release were noticeably lower than expected. The CPI\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased by 0.1 per cent (seasonally adjusted) in the quarter, while the underlying rate of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation was ¼ per cent. In year-ended terms, headline inflation was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.3 per cent, with the underlying rate at 1½ per cent. The earlier exchange\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate depreciation and the drought-related increase in some food prices had led to relatively strong\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail price inflation in the March quarter. However, these inflationary pressures had been more than\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffset by broad-based weakness in other CPI components, which was likely to be more persistent.</p>", "<p>Rental inflation had remained low, driven by a marked slowing in rental inflation in Sydney; data on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnewly advertised rents suggested that rents had started to pick up in Perth. Developer discounts and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincentives had weighed on the prices of newly built homes, particularly in Melbourne and Brisbane. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\trange of government policy decisions had contributed to lower inflation in administered prices in recent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarters. Market and survey-based measures of inflation expectations had declined in recent months, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been the case in other advanced economies.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the recent CPI data had led the Bank to reassess the disinflationary effects of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak housing market. Combined with the lower GDP growth outlook, this had led to a downward revision to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inflation outlook, although there was also some uncertainty about the persistence of downward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure from utilities and administered price changes and the effect of housing market weakness. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral forecast scenario was for underlying inflation of around 1¾ per cent over 2019,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 per cent over 2020 and a little higher after that.</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that global financial\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were accommodative and had eased significantly since the start of the year. Market\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations for the future path of monetary policy in a number of economies had declined earlier in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, in line with guidance from major central banks that policy was likely to be more accommodative\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan previously expected. The expectation that policy rates would remain little changed for some time\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad contributed to very low levels of volatility in most financial markets.</p>", "<p>In the United States, with inflation close to but a bit below target and the federal funds rate close\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto neutral, the Federal Reserve (Fed) had reiterated that it would take a patient and flexible approach\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto its policy decisions. While the Fed's recent forecast update implied that one more policy rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease was likely by the end of 2020, market pricing implied that the Fed was expected to lower its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy rate around twice over that period. At its April meeting, the European Central Bank had\n\t\t\t\t\t\treiterated that it expected policy rates to remain at current levels at least through to the end of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2019. The Bank of Japan had indicated that its very stimulatory policy settings will remain in place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil at least mid 2020. Market participants expected the next moves in policy rates in Canada, New\n\t\t\t\t\t\tZealand and Australia to be down.</p>", "<p>Government bond yields remained at very low levels in the advanced economies, having declined since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2018 in line with downward revisions to growth and inflation projections, and the lowering of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy rate expectations by market participants. In Germany and Japan, long-term bond yields were around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tzero, close to the record lows of 2016. Members noted that Australian government bond yields had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined by more than those in other major markets over the preceding six months, following\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker-than-expected inflation data and a lower expected path for monetary policy. By contrast, Chinese\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields had increased over the preceding month, as signs emerged that policy stimulus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was providing support to economic activity.</p>", "<p>Members noted that, following the brief inversion of segments of the US yield curve in March, the slope\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the US yield curve had increased a little in April. While market commentators had noted that past\n\t\t\t\t\t\tepisodes of yield curve inversion had tended to precede recessions, the decline in credit spreads and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise in equity valuations in 2019 suggested market participants did not perceive this to be a particular\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisk.</p>", "<p>Members observed that financing conditions for corporations remained favourable. In the advanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, corporate bond yields had declined, partly because of a decline in spreads. In addition,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequity prices had increased substantially since the start of 2019 to be at their highest levels in over\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta decade, including in Australia.</p>", "<p>In China, growth in total social financing had been steady in recent months and a little higher than in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018, supported by bank lending and bond issuance. Off-balance sheet financing had continued to decline,\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting the authorities' efforts to discourage riskier forms of financing. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Chinese authorities had introduced additional measures to encourage banks to lend to small private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector firms, which had previously made use of off-balance sheet financing that was now less readily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavailable. Members also noted the substantial local government bond issuance to finance infrastructure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects, which was a key part of the authorities' stimulus measures.</p>", "<p>In foreign exchange markets, volatility had remained low over the preceding month, including in most\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerging markets. Members noted, however, that risks remained pronounced for a small number of economies\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith specific vulnerabilities, most notably Turkey and Argentina, where financial conditions had\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightened again.</p>", "<p>The Australian dollar had depreciated a little following the weaker-than-expected March quarter CPI\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelease, but overall had been little changed over recent months and remained around the lower end of its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnarrow range of the past few years. Members noted that this reflected the offsetting influences of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise in commodity prices and decline in Australian government bond yields relative to those in the major\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets over 2019. The difference between long-term government bond yields in the United States and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia had increased to a historically large 75 basis points.</p>", "<p>Housing credit growth had slowed over the preceding year, but the monthly pace of growth had stabilised\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent months. In three-month-ended annualised terms, growth in housing lending was around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4½ per cent for owner-occupiers and ½ per cent for investors. Loan\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprovals also appeared to have stabilised in recent months. Members noted that, although lending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpractices were tighter than they had been for some time, the decline in housing credit growth over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding year had been driven largely by weaker demand for finance, associated with the decline in\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing prices.</p>", "<p>The average interest rate charged on outstanding variable-rate housing loans had remained broadly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteady. While banks had increased their standard variable reference rates since mid 2018, rates on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew loans had remained materially below the average of those on outstanding loans. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks had recently reduced the rates charged on new fixed-rate loans.</p>", "<p>Funding costs for the major banks had declined to record lows in preceding months, as the increase in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshort-term money market rates in 2018 had been fully unwound and retail deposit rates had continued to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tedge lower. Despite the low cost of funding, bank bond issuance in 2019 so far had been a little below\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe average of recent years. Issuance of bonds by other corporations and of residential mortgage-backed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurities had been broadly in line with the average of recent years.</p>", "<p>The pace of growth in business lending had been maintained in recent months at rates that were above\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose of the preceding few years, driven by lending to large businesses. Lending to small businesses had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined over the preceding year. Interest rates on variable-rate loans to large businesses, which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlinked to bank bill swap rates, had declined in the March quarter. Members observed that the rates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharged on small business loans remained markedly higher than those on large business loans, with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgap between small and large business loan rates having doubled following the global financial\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrisis.</p>", "<p>Financial market participants' expectations of cash rate cuts were brought further forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the release of the March quarter CPI. Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to be lowered by 25 basis points within the next three months and again by the end of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2019.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that growth in Australia's major\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrading partners had slowed, driven by a sharp slowing in global trade associated with slower growth in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina. Members also noted, however, that targeted stimulus measures in China appeared to be having an\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect and global financial conditions remained very accommodative. In a number of advanced economies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour markets had continued to tighten and wages growth had increased, but inflationary pressures had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained subdued.</p>", "<p>Domestically, members noted that the sustained low level of interest rates over recent years had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupporting economic activity and had contributed to a decline in the unemployment rate. However,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold income growth had remained low and the March quarter inflation data indicated that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflationary pressures in the Australian economy were lower than previously thought.</p>", "<p>After updating the forecasts for the new information, the central forecast scenario remained for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogress to be made on the Bank's goals of reducing unemployment and returning inflation towards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe midpoint of the target, but at a more gradual pace than previously expected. Under the central\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscenario, GDP growth had been revised lower in the near term, but was expected to pick up to be around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2¾ per cent over 2019 and 2020. The unemployment rate was expected to remain around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5 per cent over 2019 and 2020\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore declining a little to 4¾ per cent in 2021. This implied that spare capacity would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain in the economy for some time. Given this, and the subdued inflationary pressures across the\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy, underlying inflation was expected to be 1¾ per cent over 2019,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 per cent over 2020 and a little higher after that.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the central forecast scenario was based on the usual technical assumption that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate followed the path implied by market pricing, which suggested interest rates were expected to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe lower over the next six months. This implied that, without an easing in monetary policy over the next\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsix months, growth and inflation outcomes would be expected to be less favourable than the central\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscenario.</p>", "<p>At the same time, members also recognised that there were risks to the forecasts in both directions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe risks to the global economy remained tilted to the downside, with uncertainty remaining around the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevolution of international trade policy. Domestically, the outlook for household consumption remained a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkey uncertainty, with the risks tilted to the downside given ongoing low income growth and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment occurring in housing markets. On the upside, it was possible that the combined effects of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued accommodative financial conditions, the increase in Australia's terms of trade, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenewed expansion in the resources sector and the expected lift in household disposable income growth\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould result in stronger growth in output than in the central forecast scenario.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the outlook for the domestic labour market in some detail. As in the previous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting, members discussed the scenario where inflation did not move any higher and unemployment trended\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup, recognising that in those circumstances a decrease in the cash rate would likely be appropriate. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted at the previous meeting, members recognised that the effect on the economy of lower interest rates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould be expected to be smaller than in the past, given the high level of household debt and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment that was occurring in housing markets. Nevertheless, a lower level of interest rates could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill be expected to support the economy through a depreciation of the exchange rate and by reducing\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequired interest payments on borrowing, freeing up cash for other expenditure.</p>", "<p>In light of the recent run of inflation data, the Board then discussed the likelihood that the economy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould sustain a stronger labour market with lower rates of unemployment than previously estimated, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tachieving inflation consistent with the target. In this context, members observed that the recent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinternational experience was that inflation had remained low despite historically low rates of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment. Given the international evidence and the recent Australian inflation data, members agreed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a further decline in the unemployment rate would be consistent with achieving Australia's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-term inflation target. Given this, members considered the scenario where there was no further\n\t\t\t\t\t\timprovement in the labour market in the period ahead, recognising that in those circumstances a decrease\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cash rate would likely be appropriate.</p>", "<p>Taking into account all the available information, including the various uncertainties about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook, members judged that it was appropriate to hold the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting, noting that holding monetary policy steady had enabled the Bank to be a source of stability and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence over recent years. In view of the spare capacity that remained in the economy, however,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers agreed that it was important to continue to pay close attention to developments in the labour\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket and set monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and achieve the inflation\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget over time.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.</p>"]}},

However, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdownside risks to the global outlook had increased in the preceding few months. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it was difficult to predict the effectiveness of recent policy measures in China and how\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe authorities would balance their objectives of supporting growth and containing financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks. Trade tensions and signs of slowing domestic demand had also increased the risks to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook for China.

There had been ongoing speculation that the United States\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight impose tariffs on automotive imports, which would affect imports from Germany and Japan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome economies, particularly in the east Asian region, had been affected by the trade tensions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they provide inputs to Chinese exports as part of global supply chains. A number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies had also faced a moderation in export growth because Chinese domestic demand had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowed. However, members noted that there had also been reports of firms accelerating existing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplans to shift production from China to other low-cost producers in the east Asian region.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour markets had tightened further in most advanced economies and wages growth had increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCore inflation had picked up to be close to target in some advanced economies, but remained low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin others. Headline inflation had declined towards the end of 2018 because oil prices had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby almost 30 per cent from their peak in October.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth in the United States had remained strong over 2018. Fiscal stimulus and strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth had supported consumption growth. The labour market had continued to tighten\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin early 2019 and wages growth had picked up. However, the outlook for investment had softened.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome measures of business and consumer confidence had fallen sharply in January. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers noted that it was difficult to determine whether this reflected uncertainty associated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith volatility in financial markets or a genuine deterioration in the circumstances facing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses and consumers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth in Japan was expected to recover after the sharp slowing in the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had mainly reflected disruptions from natural disasters. Growth in consumption had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by a strong labour market and a pick-up in wages growth. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption would receive a short-term boost as consumers brought forward spending ahead of an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in the consumption tax in October. Recent data suggested that business conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJapan had also remained positive. By contrast, growth in output in the euro area had slowed over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018, reflecting a combination of weaker external demand, especially from China, and some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocalised factors that could have persistent effects, particularly if they were not resolved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquickly.

However, there were signs that underlying momentum in the Chinese economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad slowed by more than suggested by the GDP data. The authorities had responded with further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttargeted policy measures. Many of these measures were aimed at encouraging spending on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure, which had led to a lift in growth in public infrastructure investment and an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupgrade to the outlook for steel demand. In India, crude steel production had remained high in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018, despite an easing in GDP growth overall.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe improved outlook for steel demand and stockpiling ahead of the Chinese New Year had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported prices for iron ore at the end of 2018, and earlier increases in oil prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboosted liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices. As a result, Australia's terms of trade were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to have increased in the December quarter. Iron ore prices had increased further in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2019, following the collapse of a tailings dam at an iron ore mine in Brazil and the subsequent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclosure of a number of other similar mines. Members observed that iron ore prices could remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh for some time, but prices were still expected to decline over the medium term. Looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead, the effect of higher iron ore prices on the terms of trade was expected to be offset by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effect of lower prices for LNG, as the decline in oil prices since October gradually feeds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe September quarter national accounts had been released the day after the December meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that growth in real GDP of 0.3 per cent in the quarter and 2.8 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year had been noticeably below expectations. There had also been downward revisions to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth in previous quarters, which had subtracted around ¼ percentage point from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended growth rate. Taking account of this and other information, the Bank had revised down\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits forecast for growth in the Australian economy by around ¼ percentage point for both 2019 and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2020. This primarily reflected a modest downgrading of the outlook for household consumption and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential construction.

GDP growth was expected to moderate to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2¾ per cent over 2020 because LNG output was expected to reach targeted levels of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction and would therefore no longer materially add to growth. Dwelling investment was also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to decline more sharply than previously expected, consistent with the decline in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential building approvals and the fall in housing prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in consumption had slowed to 2½ per cent over the year to the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Revisions to previously published data made it difficult to assess the underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmomentum of consumption over the preceding year. On balance, the slower reported growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption, together with subdued growth in retail sales in the December quarter and the likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect of lower housing prices and reduced housing market activity on consumption, warranted a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdownward revision to the outlook for consumption. As a result, year-ended growth in consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to pick up only a little over the forecast period. Members noted that uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the recent momentum of consumption and factors affecting households' future\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption decisions remained a key risk for the domestic economic outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment was likely to have been close to its peak in the second half of 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough there was still a large pipeline of residential work to be done and few signs that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects already under way were being cancelled, it had become more difficult for new apartment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects to obtain finance, and building approvals were the lowest they had been for five years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a result, dwelling investment was expected to remain at a high level in the near term, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen to decline faster than previously expected.

Non-residential construction had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined, but the pipeline of work yet to be done had remained relatively high, suggesting that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential construction would recover in coming quarters. Investment in machinery &amp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequipment and computer software had grown solidly in the September quarter. A reasonably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositive outlook for investment was supported by continued growth in corporate profits and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative financial conditions for larger firms, although conditions for smaller firms had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen more constrained. While information from liaison implied that the economy had reasonable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmomentum around the turn of the year, surveyed business conditions had declined to around their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong-run average.

Mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to increase over the forecast period as mining firms invest to maintain production;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis outlook was supported by mining firms' profitability having remained strong. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the declines in mining investment that had weighed on growth for the previous six\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears were close to an end, and instead mining investment was expected to make a small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontribution to output growth in the forecast period. Recent trade data suggested that supply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisruptions had continued to affect resource exports in the December quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFarm output had fallen by 8 per cent over the year to the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubtracting around ¼ percentage point from year-ended GDP growth. Members noted that the outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the farm sector continued to depend on the timing and magnitude of rainfall;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrier-than-average conditions in key farming areas were expected to continue in the near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent trade data suggested that rural exports had fallen in the December quarter, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences had revised down its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast for farm production in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2018/19</span>.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted the continued improvement in conditions in the labour market and that the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket data had been stronger than other data on economic activity. Employment had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrow faster than the working-age population in the December quarter, with most of this growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfull-time employment. Forward-looking indicators had been consistent with above-average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth over the first half of 2019. The unemployment rate had declined to 5 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was the lowest rate since 2011 and lower than had been expected a year earlier. Labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket conditions had been particularly strong in New South Wales and Victoria, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rates had fallen to be between 4 and 4½ per cent. The national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate was expected to edge a little lower to around 4¾ per cent over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing few years. Tightening labour market conditions were expected to put upward pressure on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twages, although to date wages growth in Australia and elsewhere had been slower to pick up than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin previous expansions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the latest data on inflation, members noted that inflation had remained low in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter, with both headline and underlying inflation a little under ½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the quarter and around 1¾ per cent over the year. Headline inflation had been lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan forecast, largely because fuel prices had been lower than expected in the quarter. Domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost pressures had been relatively subdued, partly because wages growth had remained low. More\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently, utilities prices had increased only modestly, after substantial increases in previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears, and inflation in the prices of other administered services had declined noticeably as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult of government pricing decisions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStrong competition in the retail sector had continued to dampen inflation, although deflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures in the retail sector appeared to have eased somewhat in the December quarter. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould have reflected some pass-through of the modest depreciation of the Australian dollar over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018. The drought had also contributed to higher retail inflation for food, particularly meat.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInflation in rents had remained subdued and data on newly advertised rents suggested there was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle prospect of a pick-up in the near term. Rent inflation had started to trend lower in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSydney, where the rental vacancy rate had risen and was expected to rise further in the near\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm as more supply becomes available. Rents in Perth had fallen further, although the pace of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeflation had eased. Inflation in the cost of new housing construction had trended lower,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespite the high level of dwelling investment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the inflation outcome for the December quarter had been fairly close to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations. However, the forecast pick-up in underlying inflation was now expected to occur a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle later than previously expected, mainly as a result of the lower forecast for growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP and downside risks to utilities and administered price inflation in the near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderlying inflation was expected to increase to 2 per cent by the end of 2019\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(previously by mid 2019) and to reach 2¼ per cent by the end of 2020. Headline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation was expected to fall to 1¼ per cent in mid 2019 as a result of the fall in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfuel prices since the December quarter, on the assumption the lower oil price is sustained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers spent some time considering a paper on the implications of recent developments in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing markets for the economic outlook. After rising by almost 50 per cent over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfive years to September 2017, national housing prices had fallen by around 8 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be back around mid-2016 levels. Members noted the significantly different developments in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing prices across the country. Housing prices had fallen by 12 per cent in Sydney\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand by 9 per cent in Melbourne from their peaks in 2017. There had also been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant falls in housing prices in Perth and Darwin over recent years. By contrast, housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices in Hobart and Canberra had increased over 2018, while housing prices in Adelaide,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrisbane and many regional centres had been flat. Members noted that the cumulative falls in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing prices in Sydney and Melbourne were relatively large by historical standards, and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was unusual for housing prices to fall significantly in an environment of low mortgage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates and a declining unemployment rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that some of the dynamics in housing prices could be explained by the fact that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe supply of housing does not respond quickly to changes in demand. In particular, the run-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin housing prices had occurred during a period when housing supply had not picked up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficiently to match higher demand from more rapid population growth. Over time, higher housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had eventually led to a sizeable increase in supply, but this had taken longer than in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious cycles. Another factor weighing on prices was a noticeable decline in demand from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeign buyers in recent years, which had also been apparent in housing markets in some other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRental vacancy rates are one key indicator of the balance of supply and demand in the housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket. In most states, rental vacancies had been around or somewhat below average at the end of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018, suggesting supply and demand for housing had been roughly balanced. In Melbourne, despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fall in prices and large increase in supply, the vacancy rate had declined. By contrast,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trental vacancies in Sydney had been increasing and advertised rents had fallen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers also noted that housing credit growth had declined further in preceding months and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had been a notable drop in loan approvals by the major banks. Growth in lending to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors had slowed sharply since mid 2017 to be close to zero, while growth in lending to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers had moderated to around 5½ per cent in six-month-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannualised terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe slower growth in lending for housing over the preceding year appeared to reflect weaker\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand. Nevertheless, credit conditions for some borrowers had remained tighter than they had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen for some time following the strengthening of lending policies and practices over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. Liaison with mortgage brokers suggested that the increased public scrutiny associated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndustry may have led some individual loan assessors at banks to apply stricter criteria than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspecified in official lending requirements. However, banks reported that while loan assessors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been referring more approvals to credit officers, final loan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproval rates had remained high. Moreover, lenders had continued to compete for borrowers of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh credit quality by offering new loans at lower interest rates than those offered on existing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom a longer-run perspective, members assessed that, following such large increases in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices, the effect of the recent price falls on overall economic activity was expected to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively small. However, members observed that if prices were to fall much further,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption could be weaker than forecast, which would result in lower GDP growth, higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment and lower inflation than forecast. From a financial stability perspective, tighter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending standards, an improving labour market and low interest rates were all likely to support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds' capacity to service their debt. Few households were in negative equity positions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespite the falls in housing prices, implying that banks' losses would be limited even if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold financial stress were to become more widespread.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to other financial market developments, members observed that while housing credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had declined, business credit growth had strengthened over 2018, with contributions from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe foreign banks and the major banks. However, this growth had been driven by increased lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto large businesses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that conditions had tightened somewhat in a number of Australian financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, in line with global developments. Spreads of bank bond yields to Australian government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbonds had widened a little, reflecting a global rise in risk premiums. Nevertheless, yields on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbank bonds were little changed around the level of the preceding few years, given the decline in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian government bond yields. Australian equity prices had declined in the December quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong with global equity markets, but had recovered in January to be back around their October\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels. Members noted that share prices of Australian banks had risen on the morning of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting, following the release of the final report of the royal commission and the Government's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponse the preceding afternoon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoney market interest rates had remained higher than a year earlier, contributing to a small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in banks' funding costs over the period since then. In response, most lenders had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased their standard variable mortgage interest rates a little since mid 2018. However, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect of rising standard variable rates had been partly offset by borrowers refinancing at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower rates, given the strong competition for low-risk borrowers. Members noted that, overall,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmortgage interest rates remained relatively low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to global financial markets, members observed that financial conditions had tightened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat in recent months in most advanced economies, with increased volatility and a general\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise in equity and credit risk premiums. Nevertheless, there had been a partial retracement of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tightening in recent weeks and financial conditions remained accommodative.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt its January meeting, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had left the federal funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate unchanged and removed its forward guidance for further interest rate increases. The FOMC\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad emphasised that it would be patient in making any future adjustments to the federal funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate, and that future monetary policy decisions would be more closely guided by the incoming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata because interest rates were closer to estimates of neutral. The FOMC had also indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it would be open to slowing the pace of its planned balance sheet reduction if warranted by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic or market developments. Financial market pricing had shifted to imply that the next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmove in the federal funds rate was expected to be down, although this was not expected to occur\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil at least late 2020. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to maintain their stimulatory policy settings for an extended period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that government bond yields had declined across the major global markets over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding two months, reflecting the downward shift in expectations for future policy rates,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong with a fall in compensation for future inflation following falls in oil prices. These\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanges had also reflected increased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. Australian government bond yields had declined broadly in line with global developments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith long-term government bond yields in Australia remaining around 50 basis points below those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been a modest depreciation of the US dollar in nominal trade-weighted terms since late\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018, reflecting the more noticeable shift in the outlook for monetary policy in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates than in other major economies. Members noted that the depreciation had been more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpronounced against the Japanese yen, which had appreciated to around its highest level in two\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears on a trade-weighted basis. The Chinese renminbi had also appreciated modestly over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding month, reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar as well as signs of some progress\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton US–China trade negotiations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had depreciated a little further in nominal trade-weighted terms over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding two months, largely reflecting the appreciation of the yen and renminbi. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverall, the Australian dollar had remained within the range observed over the preceding few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. Members observed that there had been two broadly offsetting influences on the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar exchange rate over the preceding year: the increase in commodity prices and the terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade had been supporting the Australian dollar over this period, while the relative decline in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian government bond yields had been working in the opposite direction.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn global capital markets, corporate bond spreads had risen in recent months and bond issuance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad eased, particularly for lower-rated borrowers.

Similarly, global equity markets had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined sharply in late 2018, before recovering somewhat since. The widening in credit spreads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand decline in equity prices had reflected lower expectations for corporate earnings growth, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as a rise in the risk premium demanded by investors. However, members observed that overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing costs for corporations had remained low as a result of low government bond yields, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe corrections in these markets had followed an extended period of elevated valuations,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the authorities had implemented further targeted measures to support lending to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate firms, particularly small-sized enterprises, in the context of slowing economic growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese firms' access to finance had been tightened over the course of 2018 as a result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier measures by the authorities to reduce risks in the financial system by restricting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavailability of ‘shadow finance’. Since the latter part of 2018, the authorities had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen encouraging banks to increase their lending to these types of firms, although members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat larger banks were less accustomed to lending to this sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that conditions in other emerging markets had stabilised in recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing a tightening in conditions during 2018.

These developments had reflected policy adjustments in some countries, lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy rate expectations in the United States and the associated depreciation of the US dollar,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, for oil-importing countries, the decline in oil prices. However, members noted that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained a risk that financial conditions in emerging markets could tighten further. Concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout trade tensions and a slowdown in growth, particularly in China, remained particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant for emerging markets in Asia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market pricing implied that the Australian cash rate was expected to remain unchanged\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a considerable period, with some expectation of a decrease by late 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that the global economy had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to grow at an above-trend pace in 2018, although growth had moderated in some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies in the second half of the year. In particular, growth in China had slowed further and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe authorities had continued to ease policy in a targeted way to support growth, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector.

More broadly, however, financial conditions had tightened somewhat in most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor advanced economies, but remained accommodative.

However, members noted that there were significant uncertainties around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forecasts, with scenarios where an increase in the cash rate would be appropriate at some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would be appropriate. Moreover, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprobabilities around these scenarios were now more evenly balanced than they had been over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding year, when an eventual increase in the cash rate had appeared more likely.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers would continue to assess the outlook carefully. However, given that further progress in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treducing unemployment and lifting inflation was a reasonable expectation, members agreed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, they assessed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstability and confidence while further progress unfolds. Members judged that holding the stance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy and achieving the inflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

GDP growth outcomes for the March quarter in some economies had been\n\t\t\t\tslightly stronger than the second half of 2018, while labour markets had remained tight. However, global\n\t\t\t\ttrade and conditions in the global manufacturing sector had remained weak. New export orders had been\n\t\t\t\tlittle changed at subdued levels and growth in industrial production had slowed in many economies,\n\t\t\t\tincluding those economies in east Asia that are closely integrated with global supply chains.</p>", "<p>The US–China trade dispute had escalated in May, intensifying the downside risk posed to the\n\t\t\t\tglobal economic outlook from this source. The United States had proceeded to increase tariffs from\n\t\t\t\t10 per cent to 25 per cent on US$200 billion of imports from China, and China had\n\t\t\t\tresponded by announcing that tariffs would increase by 5–25 per cent on\n\t\t\t\tUS$60 billion of US imports from 1 June 2019. In the days leading up to the meeting, the\n\t\t\t\tUS administration had also announced tariff measures affecting Mexico and India.</p>", "<p>In the major advanced economies, GDP growth for the March quarter had been somewhat stronger than in\n\t\t\t\tthe second half of 2018. However, in both Japan and the United States the contribution from domestic\n\t\t\t\tdemand had declined, and investment intentions in Japan pointed to only moderate investment growth over\n\t\t\t\tthe period to early 2020. Nevertheless, labour markets in the advanced economies had remained tight. As\n\t\t\t\ta result, wages growth had continued to increase, reaching around the highest rates recorded during the\n\t\t\t\tcurrent expansion in the three major advanced economies. Moreover, firms' employment intentions\n\t\t\t\thad remained positive at high levels and firms had continued to report widespread difficulties in\n\t\t\t\tfilling jobs.</p>", "<p>Inflation had remained subdued globally despite tight labour markets and rising wages growth in many\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies. Core inflation had been below target in the three major advanced economies,\n\t\t\t\tfollowing the decline in core inflation in the United States in recent months. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\ttemporary factors had been contributing to the decline in the US core inflation measure, with the\n\t\t\t\ttrimmed mean underlying inflation measure close to 2 per cent over recent months.</p>", "<p>In China, indicators of activity had moderated in April. The moderation had partly reversed the\n\t\t\t\tunusually strong results in March, which had included activity brought forward ahead of tax changes that\n\t\t\t\tcame into effect on 1 April 2019. Growth in fixed asset investment had slowed in April, driven by a\n\t\t\t\tsharp fall in manufacturing investment, while infrastructure investment had been supported by increased\n\t\t\t\tgovernment spending. Industrial production had slowed across a wide range of products in April, although\n\t\t\t\tproduction of construction-related materials – such as steel, plate glass and cement – had\n\t\t\t\tremained strong.</p>", "<p>Elsewhere in east Asia, growth had slowed further in the March quarter, mainly because of weaker growth\n\t\t\t\tin exports and investment. Growth in India had been at the lower end of the range of recent experience,\n\t\t\t\twith members noting that the recent tariff announcements by the US administration could adversely affect\n\t\t\t\tIndian exports of goods.</p>", "<p>Commodity price movements had been mixed since the previous meeting. Iron ore and rural prices had\n\t\t\t\tincreased. The increase in iron ore prices had been underpinned by supply constraints, strong demand\n\t\t\t\tfrom China and an increase in steel production. On the other hand, the prices of coal, oil and base\n\t\t\t\tmetals had declined. Members noted that the decline in oil prices had mainly reflected renewed concerns\n\t\t\t\taround the outlook for global oil demand.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members noted that national accounts data for GDP growth in the March quarter would be released the day\n\t\t\t\tafter the meeting. GDP growth was expected to have been a little firmer than in the preceding two\n\t\t\t\tquarters, supported by growth in exports, non-mining business investment and public spending. Growth in\n\t\t\t\tconsumption, however, was expected to continue to be sluggish and dwelling investment was expected to\n\t\t\t\thave declined further in the March quarter.</p>", "<p>Information received for the June quarter and indicators of future economic activity had been mixed.\n\t\t\t\tBusiness conditions and consumer sentiment had been broadly stable at or slightly above average levels.\n\t\t\t\tInformation from the ABS capital expenditure survey and the Bank's business liaison contacts\n\t\t\t\tsuggested that mining investment was close to its trough, while the available information pointed to\n\t\t\t\tongoing modest growth in non-residential building investment. Members noted that the low- and\n\t\t\t\tmiddle-income tax offset, including the increase announced in the Australian Government Budget for\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span>, would boost household disposable income and could support household\n\t\t\t\tconsumption in the second half of 2019.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the distributional implications of low interest rates on household incomes.\n\t\t\t\tLower interest rates lead to a decline in the interest that households pay on their debt, but also lead\n\t\t\t\tto a decline in the interest income that households receive from interest-bearing assets, such as term\n\t\t\t\tdeposits. As such, changes in interest rates have different effects on different groups of households.\n\t\t\t\tIn particular, members recognised that many older Australians rely on interest income, which would\n\t\t\t\tdecline with lower interest rates. The overall net effect of lower interest rates was nevertheless\n\t\t\t\texpected to boost aggregate household disposable income and thus spending capacity.</p>", "<p>Conditions in established housing markets had remained weak. Housing prices had continued to decline in\n\t\t\t\tSydney and Melbourne during May, although the pace of decline had eased from earlier in the year.\n\t\t\t\tHousing prices had continued to decline markedly in Perth. Members noted that the housing market was\n\t\t\t\tlikely to be affected by the removal of uncertainty around possible changes to taxation arrangements\n\t\t\t\trelating to housing. They also considered the effects of the Australian Prudential Regulation\n\t\t\t\tAuthority's (APRA's) proposal to amend its requirement for banks to determine the\n\t\t\t\tborrowing capacity of loan applicants using a specified minimum interest rate. While it remained too\n\t\t\t\tearly to determine the overall effects, auction clearance rates had increased noticeably in Sydney the\n\t\t\t\tweekend following these developments. Building approvals had declined further in April, however, to be\n\t\t\t\tmore than 20 per cent lower over the preceding 12 months. This suggested that, even if\n\t\t\t\tthere were a marked turnaround in housing sentiment, given the lags involved it would take some time for\n\t\t\t\tthis to translate into higher residential construction activity.</p>", "<p>Several key domestic data series relating to the labour market had been released over the previous\n\t\t\t\tmonth. The wage price index had increased by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter to be\n\t\t\t\t2.3 per cent higher over the year. While wages growth had been higher than a year earlier in\n\t\t\t\tmost industries and states, the low rate of wages growth provided further evidence of spare capacity in\n\t\t\t\tthe labour market. Wages growth in the private sector had been unchanged in the March quarter, and had\n\t\t\t\tincreased to 2.4 per cent over the year (2.7 per cent including bonuses). The Fair\n\t\t\t\tWork Commission had recently granted a 3.0 per cent increase in the national minimum and award\n\t\t\t\tclassification wages, which would take effect from 1 July 2019. Members noted that this decision\n\t\t\t\tdirectly affected the wages of around one-fifth of workers in Australia. Public sector wages growth had\n\t\t\t\tbeen little changed in recent years because of caps on salary increases for public sector employees.\n\t\t\t\tMembers also noted that an increasing proportion of business liaison contacts were expecting wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth to be stable in the year ahead, although the proportion of contacts expecting wages growth to\n\t\t\t\tdecline had continued to fall.</p>", "<p>The data on conditions in the labour market in April had been mixed. The unemployment rate had\n\t\t\t\tincreased to 5.2 per cent in April from (an upwardly revised) 5.1 per cent in March.\n\t\t\t\tThis followed a six-month period during which the unemployment rate had remained at around\n\t\t\t\t5 per cent. The increase in the unemployment rate had been accompanied by an increase in the\n\t\t\t\tparticipation rate to its highest level on record. The underemployment rate had also increased in April.\n\t\t\t\tWhile the unemployment rate in both New South Wales and Victoria remained historically low, in both\n\t\t\t\tstates it had increased since the beginning of 2019. Employment growth nationwide had moderated in 2019,\n\t\t\t\tbut had remained above growth in the working-age population. Employment growth had been robust in most\n\t\t\t\tstates in preceding months; the exceptions were Western Australia and Tasmania, where the level of\n\t\t\t\temployment had been roughly unchanged since mid 2018.</p>", "<p>Forward-looking indicators of labour demand pointed to a moderation in employment growth in the near\n\t\t\t\tterm, to around the rate of growth in the working-age population. Measures of job advertisements had\n\t\t\t\tdeclined over recent months. Employment intentions reported by the Bank's business liaison\n\t\t\t\tcontacts had been lower than in mid 2018, but these intentions were still generally positive.</p>", "<p>Members had a detailed discussion of spare capacity in the labour market. Although difficult to measure\n\t\t\t\tdirectly, the extent of spare capacity in the labour market is an important factor that affects wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth and price inflation. On a number of measures, it was apparent that the labour market still had\n\t\t\t\tsignificant spare capacity. The main approach to measuring spare capacity is to compare the current\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate with an estimate of the unemployment rate associated with full employment, which is\n\t\t\t\tthe rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation. The Bank's estimate of this\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had declined gradually over recent years, to be around 4½ per cent\n\t\t\t\tcurrently.</p>", "<p>Members noted the significant uncertainty around modelled estimates of the unemployment rate consistent\n\t\t\t\twith full employment. They also discussed other measures of spare capacity, including underemployment of\n\t\t\t\tpart-time workers, recognising that the supply side of the labour market had been quite flexible. Strong\n\t\t\t\temployment growth over recent years had encouraged more people to join the labour force, allowing the\n\t\t\t\teconomy to absorb increased activity without generating inflationary pressure. Notwithstanding the\n\t\t\t\tuncertainties involved, members revised their assessment of labour market capacity, acknowledging the\n\t\t\t\taccumulation of evidence that there was now more capacity for the labour market to absorb additional\n\t\t\t\tlabour demand before inflation concerns would emerge.</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that escalating trade\n\t\t\t\tdisputes had led to a rise in volatility in global financial markets over preceding weeks, most notably\n\t\t\t\tin equity markets. Nevertheless, with central banks expected to maintain expansionary policy settings\n\t\t\t\tand risk premiums generally low, global financial conditions remained accommodative.</p>", "<p>The escalation in the trade dispute between the United States and China had resulted in declines in\n\t\t\t\tglobal equity markets. The fall in equity prices had been particularly sharp in China, but substantial\n\t\t\t\tdeclines had also been seen in the United States as well as in a range of other advanced economies.\n\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the declines in equity prices had been largest for sectors more directly exposed\n\t\t\t\tto the announced and prospective tariff changes and/or deriving a larger share of revenue from\n\t\t\t\tinternational trade.</p>", "<p>By contrast, Australian equity prices were little changed at close to their highest level in a decade.\n\t\t\t\tMembers noted that a sharp increase in Australian banks' share prices, following the federal\n\t\t\t\telection, had partly offset a recent decline in resource stocks in the context of escalating trade\n\t\t\t\ttensions.</p>", "<p>Members noted that there had been only a modest tightening in financial conditions in emerging markets,\n\t\t\t\tincluding in Mexico, where trade tensions with the United States had recently resurfaced. Equity prices\n\t\t\t\thad declined and sovereign credit spreads had widened somewhat, and there had been modest outflows from\n\t\t\t\tbond and equity funds in emerging markets. Currencies of emerging market economies had also generally\n\t\t\t\tdepreciated a little, although there had mostly been little change in yields on government bonds\n\t\t\t\tdenominated in local currencies.</p>", "<p>In the advanced economies, there had been some widening in yield spreads between corporate and\n\t\t\t\tsovereign debt, particularly for corporations rated below investment grade. Members observed that\n\t\t\t\tfinancing costs for corporations remained low nonetheless, with government bond yields having declined\n\t\t\t\tfurther over the preceding month, in some cases to historic lows. This had partly reflected a shift down\n\t\t\t\tin market participants' expectations of future policy interest rates in several advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies, including Australia, in an environment of ongoing trade tensions and subdued inflation. In\n\t\t\t\tthe cases of the United States, Canada and New Zealand, members noted that market pricing implied a\n\t\t\t\tlowering of policy rates in the period ahead, although central banks in these economies had not\n\t\t\t\tindicated that a near-term change in policy rates was in prospect.</p>", "<p>Volatility in foreign exchange markets had generally remained low, although the Japanese yen had\n\t\t\t\tappreciated over recent weeks, as tends to be the case in periods of increased uncertainty. There had\n\t\t\t\tbeen a moderate depreciation of the Chinese renminbi over the preceding month.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated a little over preceding months, remaining\n\t\t\t\taround the lower end of its narrow range of the preceding few years. Members also noted that while the\n\t\t\t\tstrength in commodity prices had supported the exchange rate, the decline in Australian government bond\n\t\t\t\tyields relative to those in the major markets over 2019 had worked in the opposite direction. Long-term\n\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields in Australia remained noticeably below those in the United States, although this\n\t\t\t\tgap had narrowed a little recently as market participants' expectations for the future path of\n\t\t\t\tthe US federal funds rate were revised sharply lower.</p>", "<p>Housing credit growth had stabilised in recent months, having slowed substantially over the preceding\n\t\t\t\tyear. Growth in housing lending to owner-occupiers was running at around 4½ per cent in\n\t\t\t\tsix-month-ended annualised terms, while the rate of growth in housing lending to investors had been\n\t\t\t\tclose to zero since early 2019. Although standard variable reference rates for housing loans had\n\t\t\t\tincreased since mid 2018, the average rate paid on outstanding loans had been little changed since\n\t\t\t\tthen, as banks had continued to compete for new borrowers by offering materially lower rates on new\n\t\t\t\tloans. Borrowers shifting from interest-only to principal-and-interest loans had also put downward\n\t\t\t\tpressure on average outstanding mortgage rates.</p>", "<p>Members were briefed on the changes proposed by APRA to its requirement that banks determine the\n\t\t\t\tborrowing capacity of loan applicants using a specified minimum interest rate. Members observed that the\n\t\t\t\tproposed changes would be likely to result in a modest increase in borrowing capacity for those with\n\t\t\t\tlower interest rate loans, typically owner-occupiers and borrowers with principal-and-interest loans.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, some borrowers facing higher-than-average interest rates would not see an increase in their\n\t\t\t\tborrowing capacity. Members observed that such a change to serviceability assessments would mean that\n\t\t\t\tany reduction in actual interest rates paid would increase households' borrowing capacity a\n\t\t\t\tlittle. This would be in addition to the positive effect on the cash flow of the household sector\n\t\t\t\toverall.</p>", "<p>The pace of growth in business lending had slowed in recent months, with lending to large businesses\n\t\t\t\tcontinuing to be the sole source of growth. Lending to small businesses had declined over the preceding\n\t\t\t\tyear. Members noted that the stricter verification of income and expenses required for consumer lending\n\t\t\t\twas also being applied to many small businesses.</p>", "<p>Members noted that financing conditions for both financial and non-financial corporations were highly\n\t\t\t\tfavourable, with Australian bond yields at historic lows. Yields on residential mortgage-backed\n\t\t\t\tsecurities were also at low levels, having declined in line with the one-month bank bill swap rate\n\t\t\t\t(BBSW), which is the reference rate for these securities. Members observed that the increase in BBSW and\n\t\t\t\tother short-term money market rates in 2018 had been fully unwound. As a result, the major banks'\n\t\t\t\tdebt funding costs were now at a historic low. The major banks' retail deposit rates were also\n\t\t\t\thistorically low, with deposit rates having continued to edge lower. The average interest rate paid on\n\t\t\t\tretail deposits by banks was slightly below the cash rate, although only a small share of deposits by\n\t\t\t\tvalue received a rate below 0.5 per cent (predominantly deposits on transaction\n\t\t\t\taccounts).</p>", "<p>Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate target was expected to be lowered by 25 basis\n\t\t\t\tpoints at the present meeting, with a further 25 basis point reduction expected later in the\n\t\t\t\tyear.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the stance of monetary policy, members observed that the outlook for the global economy\n\t\t\t\tremained reasonable, although the risks from the international trade disputes had increased. Members\n\t\t\t\tnoted that the associated uncertainty had been affecting investment intentions in a number of economies\n\t\t\t\tand that international trade remained weak. At the same time, the Chinese authorities had continued to\n\t\t\t\tprovide targeted stimulus to support economic growth, and global financial conditions remained very\n\t\t\t\taccommodative. In most advanced economies, labour markets had remained tight and wages growth had picked\n\t\t\t\tup, while inflation had remained subdued.</p>", "<p>Members observed that the outlook for the Australian economy also remained reasonable, with the\n\t\t\t\tsustained low level of interest rates continuing to support economic activity. A pick-up in growth in\n\t\t\t\thousehold disposable income, continued investment in infrastructure and a renewed expansion in the\n\t\t\t\tresources sector were expected to contribute to growth in output over coming years. The unemployment\n\t\t\t\trate was expected to decline a little towards the end of the forecast period, and underlying inflation\n\t\t\t\twas expected to pick up gradually, to be at the lower end of the target range in the next couple of\n\t\t\t\tyears. Members noted that this outlook was based on the usual technical assumption that the cash rate\n\t\t\t\tfollowed the path implied by market pricing, which suggested interest rates would be lower in the period\n\t\t\t\tahead.</p>", "<p>The most recent data on labour market conditions had shown that, despite ongoing strong growth in\n\t\t\t\temployment, the unemployment rate had not declined any further in the preceding six months and had edged\n\t\t\t\tup in the most recent two months. Reasonably strong demand for labour had been met partly by a rise in\n\t\t\t\tlabour force participation. Members observed that this increased flexibility on the supply side of the\n\t\t\t\tlabour market, together with ongoing subdued growth in wages and inflation, suggested that spare\n\t\t\t\tcapacity was likely to remain in the labour market for some time. While wages growth had picked up from\n\t\t\t\ta year earlier, it had remained subdued and recent data suggested the pick-up was only very gradual.\n\t\t\t\tTogether, these data suggested that the Australian economy could sustain a lower rate of unemployment\n\t\t\t\tthan previously estimated, while achieving inflation consistent with the target.</p>", "<p>Members observed that underlying inflation had been below the 2–3 per cent target\n\t\t\t\trange for three years and that the lower-than-expected March quarter inflation data – at\n\t\t\t\t1½ per cent in underlying terms – had pointed to ongoing subdued inflationary\n\t\t\t\tpressures. In part, this reflected continued slow growth in wages. Members also observed that\n\t\t\t\tcompetition in retailing, very weak growth in rents in the context of the housing market adjustment and\n\t\t\t\tgovernment initiatives to reduce cost-of-living pressures had been dampening inflation pressures. These\n\t\t\t\tfactors were likely to continue for some time. Members recognised that Australia's flexible\n\t\t\t\tinflation targeting framework did not require inflation to be within the target range at all times,\n\t\t\t\twhich allows the Board to set monetary policy so as best to achieve the Bank's broad objectives.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, they also agreed that the inflation target plays an important role as a strong medium-term\n\t\t\t\tanchor for inflation expectations, to help deliver low and stable inflation, which in turn supports\n\t\t\t\tsustainable growth in employment and incomes.</p>", "<p>In these circumstances, members agreed that further improvement in the labour market would be required\n\t\t\t\tfor wages growth and inflation to rise to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, while the Bank's central forecast scenario for growth and inflation was unchanged, the\n\t\t\t\taccumulation of data on inflation and labour market conditions over recent months had led members to\n\t\t\t\trevise their assessment of the extent of inflationary pressure in the economy and, relatedly, the extent\n\t\t\t\tof spare capacity in the Australian labour market.</p>", "<p>Given these considerations, members considered the case for a reduction in the cash rate at the current\n\t\t\t\tmeeting. A lower level of interest rates would support growth in the economy, thereby reducing\n\t\t\t\tunemployment and contributing to inflation rising to a level consistent with the target.</p>", "<p>Members recognised that, in the current environment, the main channels through which lower interest\n\t\t\t\trates would support the economy were a lower value of the exchange rate, reduced borrowing rates for\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses, and lower required interest payments on borrowing by households, freeing up cash for other\n\t\t\t\texpenditure. Although households are net borrowers in aggregate, members recognised that there are many\n\t\t\t\tindividual households that are net savers and whose interest income would be reduced by lower interest\n\t\t\t\trates. Carefully considering these different effects, members judged that a lower level of interest\n\t\t\t\trates was likely to support growth in employment and incomes, and promote stronger overall economic\n\t\t\t\tconditions.</p>", "<p>Members also considered the risks associated with a lower level of interest rates in the period ahead.\n\t\t\t\tGiven the high level of household debt, the adjustment under way in housing markets and the tightening\n\t\t\t\tin lending practices, members judged that a decline in interest rates was unlikely to encourage a\n\t\t\t\tmaterial pick-up in borrowing by households that would add to medium-term risks in the economy. Members\n\t\t\t\tcontinued to recognise that there were risks to the forecasts for growth and inflation in both\n\t\t\t\tdirections. However, given the extent of spare capacity in the economy and the subdued inflationary\n\t\t\t\tpressures, they judged there was a low likelihood of a decline in interest rates resulting in an\n\t\t\t\tunexpectedly strong pick-up in inflation. Members also observed that a lower level of interest rates\n\t\t\t\twould stimulate activity and thereby improve the resilience of the Australian economy to any future\n\t\t\t\tadverse shocks.</p>", "<p>Taking into account all the available information, the Board decided that it was appropriate to lower\n\t\t\t\tthe cash rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. A lower level of the cash rate would assist in\n\t\t\t\treducing spare capacity in the labour market, providing more Australians with jobs and greater\n\t\t\t\tconfidence that inflation will return to be comfortably within the medium-term target range in the\n\t\t\t\tperiod ahead. Given the amount of spare capacity in the labour market and the economy more broadly,\n\t\t\t\tmembers agreed that it was more likely than not that a further easing in monetary policy would be\n\t\t\t\tappropriate in the period ahead. They also recognised, however, that lower interest rates were not the\n\t\t\t\tonly policy option available to assist in lowering the rate of unemployment, consistent with the\n\t\t\t\tmedium-term inflation target. Members agreed that, in assessing whether further monetary easing was\n\t\t\t\tappropriate, developments in the labour market would be particularly important.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent, effective 5 June.</p>"]}},

Trade\n\t\t\t\ttensions had remained elevated, although no new measures had been introduced since the previous\n\t\t\t\tmeeting.</p>", "<p>In China, recent indicators of economic activity suggested that growth had slowed since the March\n\t\t\t\tquarter. Growth in industrial production had fallen following a strong reading in March and the level of\n\t\t\t\tfixed asset investment had declined. Conditions in the Chinese property market had also softened and\n\t\t\t\tunderlying demand conditions were expected to moderate over time, given the ageing of the population and\n\t\t\t\ta slowing in the rate of urbanisation. Over the preceding month, the Chinese authorities had introduced\n\t\t\t\tadditional measures to support growth, including more favourable financing conditions for local\n\t\t\t\tgovernments investing in infrastructure projects.</p>", "<p>In east Asia, the combination of weaker Chinese growth, the downturn in global semiconductor demand and\n\t\t\t\tthe trade and technology disputes had weighed on trade, although new export orders suggested that\n\t\t\t\tconditions might be stabilising. The effect of the US–China trade dispute had not been even\n\t\t\t\tacross the region. Some economies, such as Thailand and Vietnam, had seen strong growth in their exports\n\t\t\t\tto the United States, which reflected some diversion of trade that had previously been between the\n\t\t\t\tUnited States and China.</p>", "<p>Growth in output in the United States had continued to be supported by strong growth in consumption,\n\t\t\t\twhile growth in investment appeared to have slowed further. Members noted that capital goods orders had\n\t\t\t\tslowed and that the stimulus to investment from tax cuts had largely run its course. Growth in domestic\n\t\t\t\tdemand in the euro area had been relatively resilient in the March quarter, but more recent data had\n\t\t\t\tbeen mixed. Growth in Japanese domestic demand had slowed in early 2019, partly as a result of\n\t\t\t\tspillovers from weak external demand conditions, but growth was likely to be supported in the near term\n\t\t\t\tby a pick-up in consumption growth in the lead-up to an increase in the consumption tax in October\n\t\t\t\t2019.</p>", "<p>Labour markets remained tight in the major advanced economies. Members noted that participation rates\n\t\t\t\tfor people aged between 15 and 64 years had increased significantly in recent years and unemployment\n\t\t\t\trates were at historically low levels. This suggested that there was relatively little spare capacity in\n\t\t\t\tthese labour markets. Members noted that participation rates of people aged 65 years and over had also\n\t\t\t\tbeen increasing. Wages growth had picked up, but this had not yet been translated into stronger\n\t\t\t\tinflationary pressures and inflation remained below target in most advanced economies. Although\n\t\t\t\tinflation had been around target in the United States, some measures suggested US inflation had shifted\n\t\t\t\tlower more recently. The decline in oil prices, by around 15 per cent since their peak in mid\n\t\t\t\tMay, would weigh on headline inflation globally in the near term.</p>", "<p>Iron ore prices had increased by more than 25 per cent since the previous meeting and had\n\t\t\t\tmore than doubled over the previous year. Chinese steel production had continued to grow strongly in\n\t\t\t\trecent months, despite slowing industrial activity in China. At the same time, there was limited spare\n\t\t\t\tcapacity in the seaborne market to increase supply and inventories of iron ore at Chinese ports had been\n\t\t\t\tdeclining. Rising iron ore prices had underpinned a 3 per cent increase in the Australian\n\t\t\t\tterms of trade in the March quarter.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members noted that the main domestic economic news over the previous month had been the release of the\n\t\t\t\tnational accounts for the March quarter and updates on the labour and housing markets.</p>", "<p>The national accounts reported that the domestic economy had grown by 0.4 per cent in the\n\t\t\t\tMarch quarter. Public demand had continued to support growth in the quarter, with public consumption\n\t\t\t\tboosted by the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and increased spending on the\n\t\t\t\tPharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Growth in public sector investment had been positive despite a decline\n\t\t\t\tin defence spending. Members noted that there was a strong pipeline of public infrastructure projects\n\t\t\t\tthat could support activity for some time.</p>", "<p>Private demand had contracted for the third consecutive quarter because there had been further falls in\n\t\t\t\tmining investment and housing construction. Consumption growth had remained subdued.</p>", "<p>Growth in business investment had been weaker than expected in the March quarter. This was partly\n\t\t\t\tbecause it had taken longer than expected for liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects to reach final\n\t\t\t\tcompletion. However, investment in automation and other productive efficiencies had supported machinery\n\t\t\t\t&amp; equipment investment in the mining sector. Non-mining business investment had continued to expand\n\t\t\t\tin the March quarter, supported by a further increase in non-residential construction, while non-mining\n\t\t\t\tmachinery &amp; equipment investment had fallen. Members observed that there had been some differences\n\t\t\t\tin the findings of surveys of business conditions. In the main, surveyed measures of business conditions\n\t\t\t\thad declined to around or a little above average levels. However, both the retail and transportation\n\t\t\t\tsectors had experienced well below-average conditions.</p>", "<p>Exports had increased in the March quarter, primarily driven by growth in rural and service exports.\n\t\t\t\tThe boost to meat exports in the quarter as a result of ongoing drought conditions leading to destocking\n\t\t\t\thad been larger than the subtraction from lower crop exports. Resource exports (excluding non-monetary\n\t\t\t\tgold) had fallen in the March quarter because of temporary supply disruptions. More recent data on trade\n\t\t\t\tand shipments suggested that iron ore and LNG exports had increased since the March quarter, while coal\n\t\t\t\texports appeared to have fallen. Higher iron ore prices had supported overall export values and the\n\t\t\t\ttrade surplus had increased to almost 3 per cent of GDP in the March quarter. The trade\n\t\t\t\tsurplus was at its highest level, and the current account deficit at its lowest level, measured as a\n\t\t\t\tshare of GDP, since the 1970s.</p>", "<p>Consumption had grown by 1.8 per cent over the year to the March quarter, which was well\n\t\t\t\tbelow average. Members noted that, in per capita terms, consumption had been broadly flat. Growth in\n\t\t\t\thousehold spending on essential items had been relatively steady, while the level of spending on\n\t\t\t\tdiscretionary items had fallen in the March quarter. This weakness had been broadly based across the\n\t\t\t\tstates and recent retail trade data suggested that discretionary spending had remained soft in the June\n\t\t\t\tquarter.</p>", "<p>Members had a detailed discussion of the effects on price inflation in the retail trade sector of\n\t\t\t\tincreased competition from foreign entrants and online retailers over the preceding decade or so.\n\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the increase in the supply of retail items and lower retail prices in response to\n\t\t\t\tincreased competition were positive developments for consumers, other things equal. Many retailers and\n\t\t\t\twholesalers had also become more efficient in response to more intense competition, often using new\n\t\t\t\ttechnology (including in logistics), which had resulted in relatively rapid multifactor productivity\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in these sectors. Members noted that the adjustment in the retail sector had been protracted and\n\t\t\t\thad put downward pressure on inflation for some years. In the more recent period, the effects on prices\n\t\t\t\tof greater competition had been difficult to separate from the effects of the prevailing weak demand\n\t\t\t\tconditions.</p>", "<p>Growth in household disposable income had increased in recent quarters, supported by growth in labour\n\t\t\t\tincome, but had remained low in year-ended terms. Members noted that growth in labour income had been\n\t\t\t\tdriven by strong employment growth and that growth in hourly earnings had remained subdued. New private\n\t\t\t\tsector enterprise bargaining agreements had incorporated slightly faster wages growth than agreements\n\t\t\t\treached a year earlier. However, wages growth for workers on existing enterprise bargaining agreements\n\t\t\t\thad remained subdued, and there was little prospect of a near-term pick-up in public sector outcomes\n\t\t\t\tgiven the ongoing wage caps.</p>", "<p>A small decline in growth in tax payments had also contributed to growth in household disposable income\n\t\t\t\tin the March quarter. By contrast, the income of unincorporated enterprises had remained weak, partly\n\t\t\t\tbecause of drought-related falls in farm incomes and the downturn in housing construction. Members noted\n\t\t\t\tthat this weakness was likely to continue in the near term.</p>", "<p>Dwelling investment had declined in the March quarter. Further falls were expected given the sharp\n\t\t\t\tdecline in building approvals over the preceding year and a half. While the pipeline of construction\n\t\t\t\twork yet to be done in New South Wales and Victoria remained high, liaison contacts expected housing\n\t\t\t\tconstruction could drop off more sharply because pre-sales activity had been so weak.</p>", "<p>Conditions in the established housing markets of Sydney and Melbourne had improved a little since the\n\t\t\t\tprevious meeting. Housing prices had stabilised in June in these cities and auction clearance rates had\n\t\t\t\tpicked up further, albeit still on low volumes. More generally, turnover in the housing market had\n\t\t\t\tremained low. Housing prices had continued to fall in Perth and Darwin.</p>", "<p>Employment growth had remained strong, at 2.9 per cent over the year to May. Despite this,\n\t\t\t\tthere was still spare capacity in the labour market. Some of the additional labour demand had been met\n\t\t\t\tby an increase in the participation rate, which had reached its highest level on record. Even so,\n\t\t\t\tforward-looking indicators, such as job advertisements and employment intentions, suggested that growth\n\t\t\t\tin employment would moderate over coming months. The unemployment rate had remained at\n\t\t\t\t5.2 per cent in May and the underemployment rate had remained elevated.</p>", "<p>In view of the fact the meeting was held in Darwin, members had a thorough discussion of economic\n\t\t\t\tconditions and future economic opportunities in the Northern Territory. They noted that the Northern\n\t\t\t\tTerritory economy had experienced a significant cycle related to the construction and then completion of\n\t\t\t\tthe INPEX LNG plant. The downturn in the mining cycle had had significant spillovers to other parts of\n\t\t\t\tthe Northern Territory economy because, aside from the public sector, mining and construction are the\n\t\t\t\tlargest industries in terms of gross value added. Employment had fallen in the Northern Territory over\n\t\t\t\t2019 and this had been accompanied by large flows of people moving to other parts of the country. As a\n\t\t\t\tresult, the unemployment rate for the Northern Territory had increased, but it remained lower than the\n\t\t\t\tnational average. More generally, the Northern Territory had a relatively young population and high\n\t\t\t\tlabour market participation rates. The decline in the Northern Territory population had also led to a\n\t\t\t\tsignificant decline in dwelling investment in the Northern Territory over recent years.</p>", "<p>Members observed that the broad statistics on the labour market for the Northern Territory masked the\n\t\t\t\trelative disadvantage of the Indigenous population. The unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians on\n\t\t\t\taverage was relatively high, and Indigenous Australians were less likely to complete school and more\n\t\t\t\tlikely to experience poor health. These measures of Indigenous disadvantage were particularly acute in\n\t\t\t\tremote locations, where it is more difficult to deliver services.</p>", "<p>Members noted that there were a number of opportunities for economic growth in the Northern Territory\n\t\t\t\tin the future, including tourism, agricultural exports (including live beef exports), the defence\n\t\t\t\tindustry and mining. Higher mining investment in the Northern Territory in the future could come from\n\t\t\t\tsome small-scale mining projects that had not yet reached final investment decision and the possibility\n\t\t\t\tof some onshore unconventional gas projects.</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting the significant change in the\n\t\t\t\texpected path of monetary policy around the world, particularly in the United States. This change had\n\t\t\t\treflected a combination of weaker-than-expected economic activity and inflation over recent months, as\n\t\t\t\twell as the downside risks from the trade and technology disputes between the United States and\n\t\t\t\tChina.</p>", "<p>Monetary policy in the United States had been unchanged in June, but the Federal Reserve had indicated\n\t\t\t\tthat it was prepared to act to sustain the economic expansion. Members of the Federal Open Market\n\t\t\t\tCommittee (FOMC) saw a stronger case to reduce the federal funds rate during 2019, in contrast with the\n\t\t\t\tearlier ‘patient’ stance as the FOMC had awaited further data. Market pricing had moved to\n\t\t\t\timply an expectation that the federal funds rate would decline by 100 basis points over the\n\t\t\t\tfollowing year, compared with 50 basis points a month earlier.</p>", "<p>In other major economies, the European Central Bank had indicated that it was prepared to add more\n\t\t\t\tmonetary stimulus if the outlook for growth and inflation did not improve, including by expanding its\n\t\t\t\tbond-buying program. The Bank of Japan had intimated that it would allow bond yields to move below the\n\t\t\t\tlower end of its ‘yield curve control’ target and reiterated that there was scope to ease\n\t\t\t\tmonetary policy further if needed. And in China, market participants expected the People's Bank\n\t\t\t\tof China to ease monetary policy further in the period ahead.</p>", "<p>As expectations for monetary policy easing had firmed over the course of this year, government\n\t\t\t\tbond yields had declined further in major markets, to a record low in Germany and further into negative\n\t\t\t\tterritory in Japan. In the United States, lower bond yields reflected lower expected real policy rates\n\t\t\t\tfor an extended period, as well as persistently low inflation and term premia. Yields on 10-year\n\t\t\t\tAustralian government bonds had reached a historical low of 1.3 per cent, with yields\n\t\t\t\tremaining around 70 basis points below US treasury bond yields of similar maturity. Compensation\n\t\t\t\tfor risk on corporate bonds globally remained compressed, as market participants judged that policy\n\t\t\t\teasing would support growth in economic activity and profits. Members noted that, as a result, the cost\n\t\t\t\tof funds for corporations remained low, including in Australia.</p>", "<p>Equity prices had increased in\n\t\t\t\tmajor markets over the preceding month, to a record high level in the United States, despite prominent\n\t\t\t\tdownside risks. Higher equity prices owed primarily to a lowering of discount rates, reflecting the\n\t\t\t\texpected easing of monetary policies, whereas the outlook for corporate earnings had been little\n\t\t\t\tchanged. Recent movements in equity prices in Australia had broadly followed international trends, with\n\t\t\t\tincreases in equity prices in all main sectors over the preceding month. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\tanalysts' forecasts of earnings of Australian non-resource companies had declined over the course\n\t\t\t\tof the past year, consistent with broader surveys of business conditions.</p>", "<p>Members noted that\n\t\t\t\tbank liquidity conditions in China had remained accommodative overall. However, the solvency and\n\t\t\t\tliquidity of small banks (which account for one-quarter of banking assets) had been attracting more\n\t\t\t\tscrutiny from both investors and the authorities after a period of rapid asset growth, amid wider\n\t\t\t\tfinancial stability concerns.</p>", "<p>In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had remained\n\t\t\t\taround multi-year highs on a trade-weighted basis, although it had depreciated somewhat in the weeks\n\t\t\t\tleading up to the meeting as US bond yields had declined relative to those in other major economies. The\n\t\t\t\teuro had remained within the relatively narrow range of the preceding few years on a trade-weighted\n\t\t\t\tbasis, while the yen had broadly appreciated over recent months. The Australian dollar had been largely\n\t\t\t\tunchanged following the decision to lower the cash rate in June. Nevertheless, having depreciated by\n\t\t\t\tabout 3 per cent in TWI terms since late 2018, the Australian dollar was around its lows of\n\t\t\t\trecent years, with the effect of the decline in Australian bond yields relative to other major markets\n\t\t\t\tover that period partly offset by the unexpected strength in commodity prices.</p>", "<p>In Australia,\n\t\t\t\tmonthly housing credit growth had remained broadly stable in recent months, particularly for lending for\n\t\t\t\towner-occupation. Aggregate housing credit had been growing at an annualised rate of around\n\t\t\t\t3 per cent, with much of the decline in the rate of growth over the preceding year driven by\n\t\t\t\tweaker demand for finance associated with the correction in the housing market. Loan approvals by both\n\t\t\t\towner-occupiers and investors had continued to decline in May. However, an easing in the loan\n\t\t\t\tserviceability interest-rate floor was likely to see a boost in borrowing capacity for many new\n\t\t\t\tborrowers, which would be in addition to the positive effect on the cash flow of the household sector\n\t\t\t\toverall following the reduction in the cash rate at the previous meeting.</p>", "<p>The three-month bank\n\t\t\t\tbill swap rate (BBSW) had declined further over the preceding month. Accordingly, the increase in the\n\t\t\t\tspreads of BBSW and other short-term money market rates to the overnight indexed swap rate in 2018 had\n\t\t\t\tbeen fully unwound. Wholesale funding costs (which affect two-thirds of banks' debt funding) had\n\t\t\t\talso declined in line with the cash rate. As a result, the major banks' debt funding costs had\n\t\t\t\treached a historic low.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the favourable financing conditions for non-financial\n\t\t\t\tcorporations had supported corporate bond issuance. Although business credit growth had declined over\n\t\t\t\trecent months, growth in total business debt had remained little changed. Meanwhile, yields on\n\t\t\t\tresidential mortgage-backed securities had also been at low levels and issuance by non-banks in this\n\t\t\t\tmarket had increased significantly in the June quarter, to levels not seen since prior to the global\n\t\t\t\tfinancial crisis.</p>", "<p>Members noted that most lenders had passed on the 25 basis points\n\t\t\t\treduction in the cash rate in June to mortgage rates. Business borrowing rates had declined in line with\n\t\t\t\tthe decline in BBSW. Members also noted that the reduction in the cash rate had been passed through to\n\t\t\t\tmany retail deposit rates, although some of these rates were already very low.</p>", "<p>Market pricing\n\t\t\t\timplied that further monetary policy easing was expected following recent data and the Bank's\n\t\t\t\tcommunication since the previous meeting. A 25 basis points reduction in the cash rate had been\n\t\t\t\tfully priced in by August 2019, with a further easing expected by the end of the year.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>Members observed that the outlook for the global economy remained reasonable, although the risks from\n\t\t\t\tthe international trade and technology disputes remained high. Growth in trade had remained weak and\n\t\t\t\tthere had been further signs that heightened uncertainty was affecting investment decisions. Despite\n\t\t\t\ttight labour markets and rising wages growth, inflation had generally remained low in the advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies. Both the trade-related downside risks to global growth and ongoing subdued inflation had\n\t\t\t\tspurred an increased expectation that major central banks would ease monetary policy. This had\n\t\t\t\treinforced already very accommodative conditions in global financial markets.</p>", "<p>In considering the policy decision, members discussed the recent data on output and the labour market.\n\t\t\t\tOn the former, GDP growth had been well below trend over the year to the March quarter. Despite strong\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in employment, growth in household disposable income had remained low and this had contributed to\n\t\t\t\tlow growth in consumption. Members noted the near-term prospects for a lift in income growth and the\n\t\t\t\tcontribution of the low and middle income tax offset. Higher growth in disposable income was expected to\n\t\t\t\tsupport consumption, although the outlook for consumption remained uncertain. Accommodative monetary\n\t\t\t\tpolicy, strong public demand, a renewed expansion in the resources sector and growth in exports were\n\t\t\t\talso expected to support a return of GDP growth to trend over coming years.</p>", "<p>Members observed that employment growth continued to outpace growth in the working-age population.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, most of the strength in labour demand over preceding months had been met by an increase in\n\t\t\t\tparticipation, which had risen to a record high level, rather than a decline in the unemployment rate.\n\t\t\t\tAlthough there had been a modest pick-up in wages growth in the private sector, wages growth had\n\t\t\t\tremained low overall. In combination, these factors suggested that spare capacity was likely to remain\n\t\t\t\tin the labour market for some time.</p>", "<p>Declining housing prices had also contributed to low growth in consumption, although there were signs\n\t\t\t\tthat conditions in some housing markets, notably in Sydney and Melbourne, had stabilised. Members noted\n\t\t\t\tthat mortgage rates were at record lows and that there was strong competition for borrowers of high\n\t\t\t\tcredit quality. However, demand for credit by investors continued to be subdued and credit conditions\n\t\t\t\tfor small and medium-sized businesses remained tight.</p>", "<p>In assessing the outlook for inflation, members agreed that further improvements in the labour market\n\t\t\t\twould be required for wages growth to increase materially. As assessed at the previous meeting, members\n\t\t\t\tagreed that the Australian economy could sustain a lower rate of unemployment, while achieving inflation\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with the target. In light of this, the recent run of data and the lower level of interest\n\t\t\t\trates resulting from the decision taken at the previous meeting, the case for a further reduction in the\n\t\t\t\tcash rate was considered.</p>", "<p>Members recognised that, in the current environment, the main channels through which lower interest\n\t\t\t\trates would support the economy were a lower value of the exchange rate than otherwise would be the case\n\t\t\t\tand lower required interest payments on borrowing, which would free up cash for other expenditure by\n\t\t\t\thouseholds and businesses.</p>", "<p>Members judged that a further reduction in the level of interest rates would support the necessary\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in employment and incomes, and promote stronger overall economic conditions, which would in turn\n\t\t\t\tsupport a gradual increase in underlying inflation. Members also judged that the extent of spare\n\t\t\t\tcapacity in the economy, and the likely pace at which it would be absorbed, meant that a decline in\n\t\t\t\tinterest rates was unlikely to encourage an unwelcome material pick-up in borrowing by households that\n\t\t\t\twould add to medium-term risks in the economy. Members recognised the uneven effect of lower interest\n\t\t\t\trates on different households.</p>", "<p>Taking into account all the available information, the Board decided that it was appropriate to lower\n\t\t\t\tthe cash rate by 25 basis points. This decision, together with the reduction in the cash rate\n\t\t\t\tdecided at the previous meeting, would assist in reducing spare capacity in the economy and making\n\t\t\t\tfaster progress in reducing the unemployment rate. Lower interest rates would provide more Australians\n\t\t\t\twith jobs and assist with achieving more assured progress towards the inflation target. The Board would\n\t\t\t\tcontinue to monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy if needed to\n\t\t\t\tsupport sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1.00 per cent.</p>"]}},

They discussed the escalation of the\n\t\t\t\tUS–China trade and technology disputes, which had intensified the downside risks to the global\n\t\t\t\toutlook. By contrast, conditions in more domestically focused sectors had generally continued to be\n\t\t\t\tresilient, supported by ongoing strength in labour markets. Employment growth had remained robust in the\n\t\t\t\tmajor advanced economies, although it had eased a little in some economies in recent months, and\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rates had remained low. Although wages growth had picked up, year-ended inflation had\n\t\t\t\tremained below target in the major advanced economies. Members noted that inflation in the United States\n\t\t\t\thad increased in recent months.</p>", "<p>The main development over the previous month had been the escalation of the US–China trade and\n\t\t\t\ttechnology disputes. The United States had announced higher tariffs on most imports from China,\n\t\t\t\tincluding consumer goods that had not previously been subject to the tariff increases, to take effect\n\t\t\t\tover the remainder of 2019. Members noted that recent and prospective increases in tariffs could\n\t\t\t\tincrease consumer price inflation in the United States by between ¼ and ½ percentage\n\t\t\t\tpoint over the following few years, based on a range of published estimates. In response to the US\n\t\t\t\tannouncements, China had suspended purchases of US agricultural products and had announced plans to\n\t\t\t\tincrease tariffs on around one-half of the value of US imports. In value terms, US exports to China\n\t\t\t\thad contracted by around 20 per cent over the year to June, while US imports from China\n\t\t\t\thad been around 3 per cent lower. Members also noted that some other east Asian economies were\n\t\t\t\tbenefiting from the diversion of US imports away from China.</p>", "<p>More generally, global trade volumes had fallen over the previous year, reflecting both the escalation\n\t\t\t\tof trade tensions and slower growth in Chinese domestic demand. Weak external demand had been reflected\n\t\t\t\tin slowing growth in global industrial production and below-average conditions in the global\n\t\t\t\tmanufacturing sector. Recent indicators suggested trade-related activity would remain weak for some\n\t\t\t\ttime.</p>", "<p>Members noted that weak external demand and heightened geopolitical uncertainty had contributed to\n\t\t\t\tlower growth in business investment in many economies, including the United States, the euro area and\n\t\t\t\tthe United Kingdom. These economies had also recorded declines in investment intentions. By contrast, in\n\t\t\t\tthe United States the household sector had been resilient, but overall GDP growth had slowed in the June\n\t\t\t\tquarter. GDP growth had also slowed in most euro area countries in the June quarter; Germany had\n\t\t\t\trecorded a small contraction in GDP. By contrast, GDP growth in Japan had been moderate, supported by\n\t\t\t\tconsumption brought forward ahead of a scheduled increase in the consumption tax in October, as well as\n\t\t\t\tongoing growth in investment, bolstered by the need to address labour shortages.</p>", "<p>Recent data suggested that growth in China had eased further. Most indicators of economic activity had\n\t\t\t\tslowed in July, including in components being supported by recent policy measures, such as\n\t\t\t\tinfrastructure investment. The level of steel production had declined slightly. Retail sales growth had\n\t\t\t\tresumed its downward trend, after having received a boost from strong growth in car sales in recent\n\t\t\t\tmonths ahead of tighter emission standards coming into effect. In India, recent indicators had also\n\t\t\t\tpointed to output growth slowing.</p>", "<p>Weak global trade had continued to weigh on growth in east Asia. Trade within the region and with China\n\t\t\t\thad contracted further in June. Growth in industrial production and survey measures of manufacturing\n\t\t\t\tconditions had remained weak. Political unrest had weighed on economic conditions for businesses and\n\t\t\t\thouseholds in Hong Kong, while an ongoing dispute with Japan had disrupted South Korean production of\n\t\t\t\telectronics. However, domestic demand elsewhere in the region had held up, supported by government\n\t\t\t\tpolicies in some cases.</p>", "<p>Iron ore prices had declined since the previous meeting, but were around 40 per cent higher\n\t\t\t\tthan a year earlier. Market reports had attributed these declines to a number of factors, including\n\t\t\t\tconcerns about the outlook for steel demand in China following the escalation of the disputes between\n\t\t\t\tthe United States and China in early August, lower steel prices and an easing in supply concerns. The\n\t\t\t\tprices of coal and rural commodities had been somewhat lower over the prior month, while oil and base\n\t\t\t\tmetals prices had been little changed, except where there had been disruptions to the supply of specific\n\t\t\t\tmetals.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>The main information on the domestic economy received since the previous meeting had been on the labour\n\t\t\t\tmarket as well as partial indicators of output growth in the June quarter in the lead-up to the\n\t\t\t\tpublication of the national accounts. Quarterly GDP growth was expected to be around\n\t\t\t\t½ per cent, supported by a strong recovery in resource exports from earlier supply\n\t\t\t\tdisruptions.</p>", "<p>The ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey suggested that mining investment had grown in the June\n\t\t\t\tquarter, driven by an increase in machinery &amp; equipment investment. The Capex survey suggested there\n\t\t\t\thad also been an increase in machinery &amp; equipment investment by the non-mining sector in the June\n\t\t\t\tquarter, while non-residential construction was expected to have declined. Investment intentions for\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span> had been positive for the mining sector, but had been modestly\n\t\t\t\tlower for the non-mining sector. Members noted that the outlook for the construction sector was\n\t\t\t\tparticularly weak.</p>", "<p>Members recognised that, overall, Australian businesses had not appeared to have been affected by the\n\t\t\t\tweak trade environment to the same extent as businesses in other advanced economies. This was partly\n\t\t\t\tbecause Australia's exports are more exposed to Chinese domestic demand and less integrated in\n\t\t\t\tglobal supply chains.</p>", "<p>Consumption growth was expected to have remained low in the June quarter. Retail sales volumes had been\n\t\t\t\tweak in the June quarter and the value of retail sales had fallen in July. The low- and middle-income\n\t\t\t\ttax offset (LMITO) was expected to boost household income, and thus support consumption growth, in\n\t\t\t\tcoming quarters. However, the Bank's liaison with retailers suggested that this had yet to lift\n\t\t\t\tspending noticeably. Members noted that even if the LMITO was used to pay off debts, this would still\n\t\t\t\tbring forward the point at which households could increase their spending.</p>", "<p>Established housing market conditions had steadied in recent months. Reported housing prices in Sydney\n\t\t\t\tand Melbourne had risen noticeably in August and auction clearance rates had increased further, although\n\t\t\t\tvolumes had remained low. Housing market conditions had been subdued elsewhere, although there were\n\t\t\t\tsigns of housing prices stabilising in Brisbane. Housing turnover had remained low. Consequently,\n\t\t\t\tspending on home furnishings and other housing-related items was not expected to contribute to\n\t\t\t\tconsumption growth in the near term. Indicators suggested that dwelling investment had declined further\n\t\t\t\tin the June quarter and indicators of earlier stages of residential building activity had remained weak;\n\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals had declined further in June and other measures of early-stage activity and buyer\n\t\t\t\tinterest had remained at low levels.</p>", "<p>Employment growth had remained strong in July, but the unemployment rate had remained at\n\t\t\t\t5.2 per cent. Employment growth over preceding months had been broadly based across states and\n\t\t\t\thad predominantly been in full-time work. Strong employment growth had been accompanied by a further\n\t\t\t\tincrease in the participation rate, which had recorded another all-time high. Members noted that the\n\t\t\t\tincrease in participation had been particularly notable for New South Wales. Forward-looking indicators\n\t\t\t\thad continued to suggest that employment growth would moderate over the following six months.\n\t\t\t\tInformation from liaison suggested employment intentions had remained weak in the residential\n\t\t\t\tconstruction sector but positive among services firms.</p>", "<p>Wages growth had remained low and the upward trend in wages growth appeared to have stalled. The wage\n\t\t\t\tprice index had increased by 2.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter. Private sector\n\t\t\t\twages growth had been unchanged in the quarter, while public sector wages growth had been a little\n\t\t\t\thigher. Most of this increase had been the result of a one-off adjustment to equalise the wages of\n\t\t\t\tnurses and midwives in Victoria with those in New South Wales.</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that government bond yields had\n\t\t\t\tdeclined and were at record lows in many countries, including Australia. Volatility and risk premiums in\n\t\t\t\tglobal financial markets had increased in August, following the escalation of the disputes between the\n\t\t\t\tUnited States and China and disappointing economic data releases in Germany and China. The persistent\n\t\t\t\tdownside risks to the global economy, combined with subdued inflation, had led a number of central banks\n\t\t\t\tto reduce interest rates in recent months and further monetary easing was widely expected.</p>", "<p>In the United States, market pricing implied that the federal funds rate was expected to decline by\n\t\t\t\taround 100 basis points over the following year. Market participants also expected the European\n\t\t\t\tCentral Bank to provide additional monetary stimulus in the near term, including renewed asset purchases\n\t\t\t\tand a reduction in its policy rate further into negative territory. Central banks in a number of other\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies had also eased policy, or signalled that they were prepared to do so, in response to\n\t\t\t\tsubdued inflation, moderating activity and downside risks to growth. For similar reasons, central banks\n\t\t\t\tin emerging markets had also been easing policy over recent months and had signalled the possibility of\n\t\t\t\tfurther easing.</p>", "<p>Financial conditions for corporations remained accommodative globally. This reflected market\n\t\t\t\tparticipants' ongoing expectations that central banks were likely to deliver further monetary\n\t\t\t\teasing to sustain the global economic expansion. Corporate bond spreads had increased a little in\n\t\t\t\tAugust, but remained low. Equity prices had declined somewhat, reflecting concerns about the outlook for\n\t\t\t\tgrowth, but remained substantially higher over the year to date. In Australia, equity prices were\n\t\t\t\t5 per cent below the record high reached in late July. Australian listed companies'\n\t\t\t\tprofits had risen, driven by the resources sector. At the aggregate level, companies had increased their\n\t\t\t\tdividends over the preceding year, although this reflected higher dividends in the resources sector in\n\t\t\t\tparticular.</p>", "<p>In China, the authorities had intervened to support three small banks in preceding months, and the\n\t\t\t\tPeople's Bank of China had continued to maintain a high level of liquidity in the banking system.\n\t\t\t\tWhile funding conditions for smaller banks had tightened this year, money market rates and corporate and\n\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields in China had generally remained low and market participants were expecting\n\t\t\t\tfurther easing in monetary policy in the period ahead.</p>", "<p>In foreign exchange markets, the Chinese renminbi had depreciated against the US dollar in August\n\t\t\t\tfollowing the escalation of the US–China disputes, while the Japanese yen had appreciated over\n\t\t\t\tthe month. The Australian dollar had been little changed at around its lowest level in some years.</p>", "<p>In Australia, borrowing rates for both businesses and households were at historically low levels, as\n\t\t\t\twere banks' funding costs. Variable mortgage rates had declined broadly in line with the reductions\n\t\t\t\tin the cash rate in June and July. Fixed mortgage rates had also declined substantially over the\n\t\t\t\tpreceding six months. Financial market pricing continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to be\n\t\t\t\tlowered by another 25 basis points by November 2019, with a further cut expected in the early part\n\t\t\t\tof 2020.</p>", "<p>Growth in housing credit had been little changed over the year to July, having declined steadily\n\t\t\t\tthrough 2018. Credit to investors had declined slightly over previous months. Meanwhile, housing loan\n\t\t\t\tapprovals to both owner-occupiers and investors had increased for the second consecutive month in July.\n\t\t\t\tThis pick-up in loan approvals had followed a significant decline over the preceding two years and was\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with the signs of stabilisation in the established housing market. Borrowing by large\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses had continued to grow at a relatively strong pace. In contrast, small businesses' access\n\t\t\t\tto finance remained difficult, and had become more difficult over the preceding year as banks had\n\t\t\t\ttightened their lending practices. While new sources of non-traditional finance had been growing,\n\t\t\t\tincluding equity funding from family offices and private equity funds, they remained a small share of\n\t\t\t\tbusiness funding.</p>", "<p>Members had a detailed discussion of the ways in which financial conditions abroad affect Australia.\n\t\t\t\tThey discussed how shifts in world interest rates and global risk premiums flow through to domestic\n\t\t\t\tfinancial conditions. While Australia's floating exchange rate means that monetary policy can be\n\t\t\t\tset largely according to domestic considerations, members discussed the large shifts in\n\t\t\t\tsavings/investment decisions globally, which were affecting the level of interest rates everywhere,\n\t\t\t\tincluding in Australia. Members also noted the critical role that the exchange rate had played over many\n\t\t\t\tyears as a shock absorber for the Australian economy. One important factor here has been that Australian\n\t\t\t\tentities raising offshore funding are able to do so in Australian dollars, either directly or via\n\t\t\t\thedging markets.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>Turning to the policy decision, members observed that the news on the international economy had\n\t\t\t\tconfirmed that the risks to the global growth outlook were to the downside. The trade disputes between\n\t\t\t\tthe United States and China had escalated and growth in China had continued to slow. There had been\n\t\t\t\tfurther indications that these developments were affecting trade and investment decisions in overseas\n\t\t\t\teconomies, although businesses had continued hiring and labour market conditions had remained\n\t\t\t\ttight.</p>", "<p>Against this backdrop and with ongoing low inflation, a number of central banks had reduced interest\n\t\t\t\trates over recent months and further monetary easing was widely expected. Long-term government bond\n\t\t\t\tyields had declined and were at record lows in many countries, including Australia. Borrowing rates for\n\t\t\t\tboth businesses and households were also at historically low levels, and the Australian dollar exchange\n\t\t\t\trate was at the lowest level that it had been in recent times.</p>", "<p>Domestically, members considered a number of developments over preceding months that had a bearing on\n\t\t\t\tthe monetary policy decision. First, employment had continued to grow strongly and the participation\n\t\t\t\trate was at a record high. However, the unemployment rate had remained steady at around\n\t\t\t\t5.2 per cent over recent months. At the same time, wages growth had remained low and there\n\t\t\t\twere few indications that wage pressures were building. Members noted that a further gradual lift in\n\t\t\t\twages growth would be a welcome development. Taken together, recent outcomes suggested that spare\n\t\t\t\tcapacity remained in the labour market and that the Australian economy could sustain lower rates of\n\t\t\t\tunemployment and underemployment.</p>", "<p>Second, there had been further signs of a turnaround in established housing markets, especially in\n\t\t\t\tSydney and Melbourne, although housing turnover had remained low. Housing credit growth had remained\n\t\t\t\tsubdued, although mortgage rates were at record low levels and there was strong competition for\n\t\t\t\tborrowers of high credit quality. Data on residential building approvals and information from the\n\t\t\t\tBank's liaison program suggested that there was likely to be further weakness in dwelling\n\t\t\t\tinvestment in the near term; members recognised that this could sow the seeds of an upswing in the\n\t\t\t\thousing price cycle at some point, particularly given the lengthy stages in the construction of\n\t\t\t\thigher-density residential housing. Demand for credit by investors continued to be subdued and credit\n\t\t\t\tconditions, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, remained tight.</p>", "<p>Finally, based on partial indicators, GDP growth in the June quarter was expected to have been around\n\t\t\t\t½ per cent. The largest contributions to growth were expected to have been from exports\n\t\t\t\tand public demand. Private final demand, which includes consumption, business investment and dwelling\n\t\t\t\tinvestment, was expected to have been weak.</p>", "<p>Looking forward, the outlook for output growth was being supported by the low level of interest rates,\n\t\t\t\trecent tax cuts, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets and a brighter outlook for\n\t\t\t\tthe resources sector. A key uncertainty continued to be the outlook for consumption growth, which was\n\t\t\t\texpected to increase over time, supported by a gradual pick-up in growth in household disposable income\n\t\t\t\tand improvements in conditions in the housing market. Inflation pressures remained subdued, but\n\t\t\t\tinflation was expected to increase gradually to be a little above 2 per cent over 2021 as\n\t\t\t\toutput growth picked up and the labour market tightened.</p>", "<p>Based on the information available, members judged that it was reasonable to expect that an extended\n\t\t\t\tperiod of low interest rates would be required in Australia to make sustained progress towards full\n\t\t\t\temployment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target. Members would assess\n\t\t\t\tdevelopments in both the international and domestic economies, including labour market conditions, and\n\t\t\t\twould ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy and the\n\t\t\t\tachievement of the inflation target over time.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.00 per cent.</p>"]}},

Near-term indicators relating to trade, manufacturing and\n\t\t\t\tinvestment had remained subdued, although consumption growth had been relatively resilient, supported by\n\t\t\t\tstrong labour market conditions especially in the advanced economies. Despite wages growth having\n\t\t\t\tgenerally trended higher over the preceding few years, inflation had remained below target in a range of\n\t\t\t\teconomies.</p>", "<p>Growth in major trading partners was expected to slow a little in 2019 and 2020. This outlook had been\n\t\t\t\trevised down a little since the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> in light of the escalation\n\t\t\t\tof the US–China trade and technology disputes and the related weakness in indicators of\n\t\t\t\tinvestment. Members noted the recent announcement by the US administration of a 10 per cent\n\t\t\t\ttariff to be imposed on a further US$300 billion of Chinese exports to the United States. Further\n\t\t\t\tescalation presented a downside risk to the outlook, particularly if heightened uncertainty weighed\n\t\t\t\tfurther on business investment. Members noted that investment intentions had already eased significantly\n\t\t\t\tin a number of economies, including the United States and the euro area, and investment had fallen in a\n\t\t\t\tnumber of economies with a high exposure to international trade, including South Korea.</p>", "<p>In China, a range of activity indicators suggested that domestic economic conditions had slowed further\n\t\t\t\tin the June quarter. Further monetary and fiscal stimulus measures had also been announced. Fiscal\n\t\t\t\tsupport had encouraged investment in infrastructure, while residential construction had continued to\n\t\t\t\tgrow relatively strongly, which in turn had supported steel production. The outlook for the Chinese\n\t\t\t\teconomy had been revised lower, largely because of the ongoing US–China trade and technology\n\t\t\t\tdisputes. Uncertainty about how these disputes would play out and how effective domestic policy measures\n\t\t\t\twould be in supporting Chinese demand continued to be an important consideration for the global growth\n\t\t\t\toutlook and, from an Australian perspective, the future demand for steel and bulk commodities.</p>", "<p>The US–China disputes and the slowing in Chinese domestic demand had affected export and\n\t\t\t\tinvestment growth in the east Asian region. However, exports to the United States had increased for some\n\t\t\t\teconomies in the region, including Vietnam, as a result of trade diversion. By contrast, growth in\n\t\t\t\tconsumption in the east Asian region had generally remained more resilient. Growth in output in India\n\t\t\t\thad slowed and the outlook was weaker than previously forecast, largely because there had been less\n\t\t\t\tfiscal support and trade tensions with the United States were emerging.</p>", "<p>In the major advanced economies, risks to the outlook remained tilted to the downside, reflecting the\n\t\t\t\ttrade disputes. The US economy had continued to grow relatively strongly into the June quarter. This was\n\t\t\t\tdespite the effects of the trade dispute on the manufacturing sector and on business investment more\n\t\t\t\tgenerally, partly because tight labour markets had supported strong consumption growth. Members noted\n\t\t\t\tthat the most recent round of tariff announcements would affect US imports of consumption goods from\n\t\t\t\tChina and could boost US consumer prices to some extent. Further slowing in investment seemed likely as\n\t\t\t\tthe effect of earlier fiscal stimulus waned and the uncertainty related to the trade and technology\n\t\t\t\tdisputes persisted.</p>", "<p>Weaker global trade and greater uncertainty had also affected growth in output in the euro area. Growth\n\t\t\t\tin Japan was expected to be boosted temporarily by spending brought forward ahead of an increase in the\n\t\t\t\tconsumption tax in October, although weaker external demand had weighed on export growth.</p>", "<p>Commodity prices had generally fallen since the previous meeting, partly in response to the escalation\n\t\t\t\tof trade tensions in early August. After more than doubling in the first half of 2019, iron ore prices\n\t\t\t\thad declined to be below US$100 per tonne. Coal and oil prices had also declined over the previous\n\t\t\t\tmonth. Rural commodity prices had been little changed. Members noted that the terms of trade for\n\t\t\t\tAustralia in the June quarter had been higher than expected.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that GDP growth was expected to have been firmer in the\n\t\t\t\tJune quarter after three weak quarters. This was partly because resource exports had recovered from\n\t\t\t\tearlier supply disruptions and mining investment was likely to be less of a drag on growth. Partial\n\t\t\t\tindicators suggested that consumption growth had remained subdued in the June quarter; the volume of\n\t\t\t\tretail sales had been subdued and sales of new cars had declined. While dwelling investment was expected\n\t\t\t\tto have declined further in the June quarter, public demand and non-mining business investment were\n\t\t\t\texpected to have continued to support growth.</p>", "<p>Members observed that the lower near-term GDP growth forecast mostly reflected the fact that\n\t\t\t\tconsumption growth had been weaker than expected over recent quarters. Members noted that consumption\n\t\t\t\tgrowth per capita had been particularly weak recently. The forecast for GDP growth over 2019 had been\n\t\t\t\tlowered to 2½ per cent. Growth was expected to pick up to 2¾ per cent over\n\t\t\t\t2020 and to around 3 per cent over 2021. This was supported by a range of factors, including\n\t\t\t\tlower interest rates, tax measures, signs of an earlier-than-expected stabilisation in some established\n\t\t\t\thousing markets, the lower exchange rate, the infrastructure pipeline and a pick-up in activity in the\n\t\t\t\tmining sector.</p>", "<p>Members noted that although the outlook for consumption remained uncertain, the risks around the\n\t\t\t\toutlook were more balanced than they had been for some time. The low- and middle-income tax offset was\n\t\t\t\texpected to boost income growth, with a surge in the lodgement of tax returns since the end of June. In\n\t\t\t\taddition, signs of a recovery in some established housing markets suggested that the dampening effect of\n\t\t\t\tdeclining housing prices on consumption could dissipate earlier than had previously been assumed.</p>", "<p>The evidence that conditions in housing markets were showing signs of a turnaround had strengthened in\n\t\t\t\tJuly. In Sydney and Melbourne, housing prices had increased, housing turnover appeared to have reached a\n\t\t\t\ttrough and auction clearance rates had risen further. Outside the two largest cities, housing market\n\t\t\t\tconditions had shown tentative signs of improvement; prices had risen in Brisbane, while the pace of\n\t\t\t\tdecline had slowed in Perth. Rental vacancies had been low in most cities except in Sydney, where they\n\t\t\t\thad risen further as new apartments were added to the rental stock.</p>", "<p>Members observed that it could take some time for the stabilisation of conditions in the established\n\t\t\t\thousing market to translate into a pick-up in construction activity. Indeed, leading indicators\n\t\t\t\tsuggested that dwelling investment was likely to decline further in the near term. Residential building\n\t\t\t\tapprovals had declined further over May and June and were around their lowest levels in six years.\n\t\t\t\tTimely information from liaison contacts suggested that increased buyer interest had yet to translate\n\t\t\t\tinto more housing sales. However, members noted that signs of a turnaround in housing markets suggested\n\t\t\t\tthere were some upside risks to dwelling investment later in the forecast period, particularly given the\n\t\t\t\texpected strength in population growth.</p>", "<p>Forward-looking indicators for business investment had been mixed. Survey measures of business\n\t\t\t\tconditions had been less positive than a year earlier, especially in the retail and transport sectors,\n\t\t\t\tbut generally had remained around average. By contrast, non-residential building approvals had trended\n\t\t\t\tup in recent months and the pipeline of work under way was already quite high. There was also a large\n\t\t\t\tpipeline of private sector projects to build transport and renewable energy infrastructure, which was\n\t\t\t\texpected to support non-mining business investment.</p>", "<p>Although mining investment had declined in the March quarter as large liquefied natural gas (LNG)\n\t\t\t\tprojects approached completion, the medium-term outlook for mining investment had remained positive. A\n\t\t\t\tnumber of projects had been committed and others were under consideration, which would add to investment\n\t\t\t\tin coming years if they went ahead. Members noted that the outlook for mining investment had not been\n\t\t\t\taffected by the recent elevated levels of iron ore prices. However, they observed that higher iron ore\n\t\t\t\tprices would add to government taxation revenues and boost household income and wealth through dividends\n\t\t\t\tand the effect on share prices. At the margin, this could provide greater impetus to spending than\n\t\t\t\tcurrently assumed.</p>", "<p>Resource exports had picked up during the June quarter as some supply disruptions to iron ore had been\n\t\t\t\tresolved and LNG production had increased further. Resource exports were expected to contribute to\n\t\t\t\tgrowth over the forecast period and the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar was expected to\n\t\t\t\tsupport further growth in service and manufacturing exports.</p>", "<p>Members noted that recent labour market data had been mixed. The unemployment rate had remained at\n\t\t\t\t5.2 per cent for the third consecutive month, which was higher than had been expected in May.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, growth in employment had continued to exceed growth in the working-age population in the June\n\t\t\t\tquarter and had been stronger than forecast in May. As a result, the employment-to-population ratio and\n\t\t\t\tthe participation rate had remained around record highs. Over the previous year, there had been a\n\t\t\t\tparticularly notable increase in the participation rates of women aged between 25 and 54 years\n\t\t\t\tand workers aged 65 years and over. Members noted that the increase in participation by older\n\t\t\t\tworkers had more than offset any tendency for the ageing of the population to reduce aggregate\n\t\t\t\tparticipation in the labour force. Members discussed some of the factors that could be contributing to\n\t\t\t\tthese trends, including slow income growth, improvements in health and greater flexibility in the labour\n\t\t\t\tmarket.</p>", "<p>Leading indicators implied a moderation in employment growth over the following six months: job\n\t\t\t\tvacancies had declined slightly over the three months to May (but remained high as a share of the labour\n\t\t\t\tforce) and firms' near-term hiring intentions had moderated, to be just above their long-run\n\t\t\t\taverage. The unemployment rate forecast had been revised higher, with the unemployment rate expected to\n\t\t\t\tremain around 5¼ per cent for some time before declining to about 5 per cent as\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in output picked up.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the outlook for the labour market was one of the key uncertainties for the\n\t\t\t\tforecasts, with implications for growth in wages, household income and consumption. The outlook for\n\t\t\t\twages growth had been revised a little lower because the outlook for the labour market suggested that\n\t\t\t\tthere would be more spare capacity than previously thought. Private sector wages growth was expected to\n\t\t\t\tpick up only modestly, while public sector wages growth would be contained by government caps on wage\n\t\t\t\tincreases. Members observed that the outlook for household consumption spending could be weaker if\n\t\t\t\thouseholds expected low income growth to persist for longer.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the June quarter CPI had been largely as expected. Trimmed mean inflation had\n\t\t\t\tincreased a little to 0.4 per cent in the June quarter, but had remained at\n\t\t\t\t1.6 per cent over the preceding year, consistent with the forecast in May. Headline inflation\n\t\t\t\thad been 0.7 per cent (seasonally adjusted), partly because fuel prices had increased by\n\t\t\t\taround 10 per cent in the June quarter; over the year, headline inflation had also been\n\t\t\t\t1.6 per cent. Overall, members noted that there had been few signs in the June quarter CPI\n\t\t\t\tnumbers of inflationary pressures emerging.</p>", "<p>Inflation in market-based services had remained steady, which was consistent with a lack of wage\n\t\t\t\tpressures in the economy. Inflation in the housing-related components of the CPI had been around\n\t\t\t\thistorical lows. New dwelling prices had declined again in the June quarter, reflecting the use of bonus\n\t\t\t\toffers and purchase incentives by developers to counter the weak housing conditions. Rent inflation had\n\t\t\t\tbeen flat in the quarter in aggregate, but had fallen noticeably in Sydney, consistent with the rising\n\t\t\t\tvacancy rate; rent deflation had eased in Perth and had been steady in most other cities. Members noted\n\t\t\t\tthat low inflation in new dwelling costs and rents, which represent around one-sixth of the CPI basket,\n\t\t\t\twas likely to persist in the near term.</p>", "<p>There had been an increase in inflation for retail items because there had been some pass-through of\n\t\t\t\tthe exchange rate depreciation and the drought had boosted certain food prices. These effects were\n\t\t\t\texpected to dissipate if there was no further exchange rate depreciation, as is usually assumed in the\n\t\t\t\tforecasts, and once normal seasonal conditions returned. Inflation in the prices of administered items\n\t\t\t\tand utilities had remained well below typical increases recorded a few years earlier.</p>", "<p>Inflation was expected to pick up more gradually than previously forecast because of subdued wage\n\t\t\t\toutcomes and the evidence of spare capacity in the economy. The experience of other economies suggested\n\t\t\t\tthat any pick-up in wages growth might take longer to translate into inflation than in the past.\n\t\t\t\tUnderlying inflation and headline inflation were both expected to pick up to be a little above\n\t\t\t\t2 per cent over 2021, as spare capacity in the labour market declined and as growth increased\n\t\t\t\tto run above potential. Members noted that there were downside risks to some individual CPI components.\n\t\t\t\tIn the near term, electricity prices could grow at a below-average pace or even fall, and government\n\t\t\t\tcost-of-living initiatives could weigh on other items in the CPI basket. Inflation rates for both new\n\t\t\t\tdwelling prices and rents were also expected to remain low in the near term, but were more uncertain\n\t\t\t\ttowards the end of the forecast period.</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that central banks in the major\n\t\t\t\teconomies had eased, or were expected to ease, policy settings in response to downside risks to growth\n\t\t\t\tand subdued inflation outcomes. Financial market volatility had increased recently from low levels, in\n\t\t\t\tresponse to the escalation of the trade and technology disputes between the United States and\n\t\t\t\tChina.</p>", "<p>The US Federal Reserve lowered its policy rate target by 25 basis points in July. Market pricing\n\t\t\t\tsuggested that the federal funds rate was expected to decline by a further 100 basis points or so\n\t\t\t\tover the following year. The Federal Reserve noted that the US labour market had remained strong.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, it was perceived by members of the Federal Open Market Committee that there was room for some\n\t\t\t\teasing of monetary policy given the implications of global developments for the US economic outlook and\n\t\t\t\tsubdued inflation pressures. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank (ECB) had foreshadowed additional\n\t\t\t\tmonetary stimulus unless the outlook for inflation in the euro area improved. The ECB indicated that it\n\t\t\t\tcould expand its bond-buying program, among other measures, and market pricing suggested that the ECB\n\t\t\t\twas likely to reduce its policy rate over the following months. Market participants were also expecting\n\t\t\t\tthe Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further in the period ahead.</p>", "<p>In response to the shift in the outlook for monetary policy, long-term interest rates had declined to\n\t\t\t\t\thistorical lows in several markets, including in Australia. Yields on government bonds were negative\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a number of European sovereigns and Japan. In addition, corporate bond spreads were low globally,\n\t\t\t\t\twith a growing portion of corporate debt in the euro area trading at yields below zero. Members\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the implications of the low level of bond yields for corporate balance sheets and\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestment.</p>", "<p>Global equity markets had declined sharply prior to the meeting, in response to the recent escalation\n\t\t\t\t\tof the trade and technology disputes. Nevertheless, equity market indices were still well above their\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels earlier in the year, supported by lower bond yields and expectations that earnings growth would\n\t\t\t\t\tbe reasonable. During July, equity market indices in the United States and Australia had reached record\n\t\t\t\t\thigh levels.</p>", "<p>In foreign exchange markets, prior to the meeting there had been an increase in volatility, from very\n\t\t\t\t\tlow levels, in response to the escalation of the trade and technology disputes. In particular, the yen\n\t\t\t\t\thad appreciated against the US dollar while the Chinese yuan had depreciated. Members took note of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe market commentary that the US and Japanese authorities could intervene in an effort to lower the\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue of their currencies. The Australian dollar had depreciated in recent times to be at its lowest\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel in many years.</p>", "<p>In Australia, the reduction in variable mortgage rates had been broadly consistent with the reduction\n\t\t\t\t\tin the cash rate in June and July. The degree of pass-through of the cash rate reductions was also\n\t\t\t\t\tcomparable to that observed over the preceding decade. Housing credit growth had declined in June, for\n\t\t\t\t\tboth owner-occupiers and investors. At the same time, however, loan approvals had picked up in June,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich for investors was the first sizeable increase for some time. This was consistent with other\n\t\t\t\t\tindicators suggesting that the housing market had stabilised over recent months. However, loan\n\t\t\t\t\tapprovals to property developers had remained subdued. Members also noted that access to finance for\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall businesses continued to be tight.</p>", "<p>Banks' debt funding costs and borrowing rates for households and businesses were at\n\t\t\t\t\thistorically low levels. Rates in short-term money markets, bank bond yields and deposit rates had all\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclined to historically low levels. The proportion of bank deposits that attract no interest had\n\t\t\t\t\tincreased marginally to be just under 10 per cent. Despite the low level of funding costs,\n\t\t\t\t\tbanks' bond issuance remained subdued. This reflected slow credit growth, along with the banks\n\t\t\t\t\tincreasing their issuance of hybrid securities to fulfil new regulatory capital requirements. Members\n\t\t\t\t\talso noted that mergers and acquisitions activity had not been especially high, despite funding\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions being very accommodative for large businesses.</p>", "<p>Market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged in August. A 25 basis\n\t\t\t\tpoints reduction had been fully priced in by November 2019, with a further 25 basis points\n\t\t\t\treduction expected in 2020. The low level of bond yields implied that the cash rate was expected to\n\t\t\t\tremain very low for several years.</p>", "<p>Members reviewed the experience of other advanced economies with unconventional monetary policy\n\t\t\t\tmeasures over the preceding decade. These measures comprised: very low and negative policy interest\n\t\t\t\trates; explicit forward guidance; lowering longer-term risk-free rates by purchasing government\n\t\t\t\tsecurities; providing longer-term funding to banks to support credit creation; purchasing private sector\n\t\t\t\tassets; and foreign exchange intervention. Members considered the key lessons from the international\n\t\t\t\texperience, noting that a full evaluation could not be undertaken as many of these measures were yet to\n\t\t\t\tbe unwound. One key lesson was that the effectiveness of these measures depended upon the specific\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances facing each economy and the nature of its financial system. Some measures had been\n\t\t\t\tsuccessful in reducing government bond yields, which had flowed through to lower interest rates for\n\t\t\t\tprivate borrowers. Other measures had been effective in addressing dislocations in credit supply.\n\t\t\t\tMembers noted that a package of measures tended to be more effective than measures implemented in\n\t\t\t\tisolation. Finally, it was important for the central bank to communicate clearly and consistently about\n\t\t\t\tthese measures.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>Turning to the policy decision, members observed that the escalation of the trade and technology\n\t\t\t\tdisputes had increased the downside risks to the global growth outlook, although the central forecast\n\t\t\t\twas still for reasonable growth. Uncertainty around trade policy had already had a negative effect on\n\t\t\t\tinvestment in many economies. Members noted that, against this backdrop, the low inflation outcomes in\n\t\t\t\tmany economies provided central banks with scope to ease monetary policy further if required. Indeed, a\n\t\t\t\tnumber of central banks had reduced interest rates this year and further monetary easing was widely\n\t\t\t\texpected. In China, the authorities had taken steps to support economic growth, while continuing to\n\t\t\t\taddress risks in the financial system.</p>", "<p>Overall, global financial conditions remained accommodative. Long-term government bond yields had\n\t\t\t\tdeclined further and were at record lows in many economies, including Australia. Borrowing rates for\n\t\t\t\tboth households and businesses were also at historically low levels and there was strong competition for\n\t\t\t\tborrowers of high credit quality. Despite this, demand for housing credit, particularly from investors,\n\t\t\t\tremained subdued, while access to credit for some types of borrowers, especially small businesses,\n\t\t\t\tremained tight. The Australian dollar had depreciated to its lowest level in recent times.</p>", "<p>Domestically, growth had been lower than expected in the first half of 2019. Looking forward, growth\n\t\t\t\twas expected to strengthen gradually, to 2¾ per cent over 2020 and to around\n\t\t\t\t3 per cent over 2021. This outlook was supported by a number of developments, including lower\n\t\t\t\tinterest rates, higher growth in household income (including from the recent tax cuts), the depreciation\n\t\t\t\tof the Australian dollar, a positive outlook for investment in the resources sector, some stabilisation\n\t\t\t\tof the housing market and ongoing high levels of investment in infrastructure. Overall, the domestic\n\t\t\t\trisks to the forecast for output growth appeared to be tilted to the downside in the near term, but were\n\t\t\t\tmore balanced later in the forecast period.</p>", "<p>Employment growth had been stronger than expected and labour force participation had increased to a\n\t\t\t\trecord high. However, the unemployment rate had increased and there appeared to have been more spare\n\t\t\t\tcapacity in the labour market than previously appreciated, although there was uncertainty around the\n\t\t\t\textent of this. The unemployment rate was expected to decline to around 5 per cent over the\n\t\t\t\tfollowing couple of years, consistent with the gradual pick-up in GDP growth. Wages growth had been\n\t\t\t\tsubdued and there were few signs of wage pressures building in the economy. Combined with the\n\t\t\t\treassessment of spare capacity in the labour market, this had led to a more subdued outlook for wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth than three months earlier.</p>", "<p>In the June quarter, inflation had been broadly as expected at 1.6 per cent. Members noted\n\t\t\t\tthat inflation had averaged a little below 2 per cent for a number of years. In the near term,\n\t\t\t\tthere were few signs of inflationary pressures building, but, over time, inflation was expected to\n\t\t\t\tincrease gradually to be a little under 2 per cent over 2020 and a little above\n\t\t\t\t2 per cent over 2021.</p>", "<p>Based on the information available and the central scenario that was presented, members judged it\n\t\t\t\treasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates would be required in Australia to\n\t\t\t\tmake sustained progress towards full employment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation\n\t\t\t\ttarget. Having eased monetary policy at the previous two meetings, the Board judged it appropriate to\n\t\t\t\tassess developments in the global and domestic economies before considering further change to the\n\t\t\t\tsetting of monetary policy. Members would consider a further easing of monetary policy if the\n\t\t\t\taccumulation of additional evidence suggested this was needed to support sustainable growth in the\n\t\t\t\teconomy and the achievement of the inflation target over time.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.00 per cent.</p>"]}},

Global GDP growth had picked up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be around 4 per cent over 2017. Globally, consumer price inflation had remained low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand stable, although there had been some signs of wages growth and core inflation picking up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral advanced economies that were operating above estimates of full employment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that growth in industrial production and exports had eased in east Asia (excluding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJapan and China) towards the end of 2017. In contrast, robust growth in Chinese industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction had been maintained during 2017, supported by a relatively strong increase in exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the latter part of the year. Some indicators suggested that conditions in early 2018 had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore positive in the manufacturing and services sectors of a number of east Asian economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted, however, that economic data for Asia were often difficult to interpret early in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe calendar year, given the effects of the Chinese New Year holidays; the usual range of data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton economic activity for China had not been available at the time of the meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, growth in total social financing had slowed in recent months, with a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswitch from non-credit to bank-based financing early in 2018. This suggested the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment's policy efforts to contain financial risks were having some effect. Policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tefforts to restrain the housing market also appeared to have had an effect, with housing price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth having slowed, especially in the larger cities. The authorities had announced a target\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor output growth in 2018 of around 6½ per cent, which was lower than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublished rate of growth for 2017 of 6.9 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOutput in the major advanced economies had grown faster than estimates of potential growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2017 and unemployment rates had declined to levels that were below those consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testimates of full employment. Other labour market indicators had also improved in a range of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries. In particular, despite ageing populations, participation rates had been stable in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro area and the United States, and had continued to increase in Japan. While monetary policies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained expansionary in the major advanced economies, monetary stimulus was expected to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduced gradually in the United States over 2018. At the same time, fiscal policy was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be significantly more expansionary in the United States, given the tax and spending packages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had recently been passed. In contrast, fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy in Japan was projected to be a little more contractionary as a result of the planned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in the consumption tax in 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to commodity prices, members noted that strong demand for high-quality inputs to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tminimise pollution from steel production, as well as buying ahead of the Chinese New Year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholiday, had contributed to increases in iron ore and coking coal prices over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth. However, oil prices had declined modestly and other commodity prices had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged over that period. At the time of the meeting, there had been little change in commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices in response to the announcement of steel and aluminium tariffs in the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the risks to the global economy, and therefore the outlook for Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould rise if other countries also increased trade protection.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the December quarter national accounts would be released the day after the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting, although some partial indicators for the quarter were already available. Net exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere expected to have subtracted from growth in the December quarter owing to temporary factors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat would unwind in 2018. In contrast, growth in consumption was expected to have rebounded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom its low rate in the September quarter, consistent with the increase in retail sales volumes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the December quarter. The Bank's liaison with retailers and measures of consumer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentiment suggested that moderate consumption growth had continued early in 2018, although the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue of retail sales in January had been relatively weak, particularly for smaller retailers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand those with physical shopfronts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment was expected to have fallen in the December quarter, driven mostly by lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in higher-density dwellings in the eastern states. Members noted that dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in detached housing and alterations and additions had fallen over 2017, but that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in higher-density dwellings had been maintained at a high level over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo years or so. Given the step down in building approvals that had occurred at the end of 2016\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the historically high level of residential construction work yet to be completed, dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was not expected to contribute to GDP growth over 2018 but nonetheless to remain at a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that conditions in the established housing market had continued to ease in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths. This had been most evident in Sydney, where housing prices had continued to decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross most segments of the market. Housing price growth had clearly slowed in Melbourne, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis had been most apparent in the more expensive parts of the market. Auction clearance rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined to around average levels in both cities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment was expected to have been higher than previously forecast in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' capital expenditure survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand on work done on non-residential construction by the private sector. Although construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork done by the public sector had ticked down in the December quarter, it was still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly higher as a share of GDP than it had been two years earlier. Early indicators of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity for the March quarter suggested business conditions had remained positive and capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutilisation had continued to trend higher.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe capital expenditure survey had also provided the fifth estimate of investment intentions for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2017/18 and the first estimate for 2018/19. These data suggested that investment in the mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector would decline in both the current and following financial years. The survey suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat nominal investment in the non-mining sector would remain around its present level over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing year or so. Members noted that translating the data from the capital expenditure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvey into national accounts estimates of business investment was challenging because firms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttended to increase their expectations for capital expenditure over time. The degree to which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey did this varied through the economic cycle, but members noted that in recent years the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupward revisions had tended to be larger than average. In addition, significant sectors of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy, such as education and health, as well as investment in intellectual property, were not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured by the capital expenditure survey.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers concluded their discussion of trends in investment by considering the drivers of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining business investment in more detail. Total investment had been very high over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding decade, as a result of the mining investment boom. As this boom had come to an end,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treal non-mining business investment had trended up, but not as quickly or as soon as had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected. One factor considered was the trend decline in the nominal non-mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment-to-GDP ratio, which had been driven by the long-term declines of the agriculture and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanufacturing sectors, both of which are relatively investment intensive. At the same time, for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe manufacturing sector, the share of investment expenditure on machinery and equipment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen, while the share of investment expenditure on intangibles, such as software, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased. On the assumption that these structural changes would persist, but that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment-to-output ratios for other industries would return to their long-run averages, this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested there were some upside risks to the Bank's forecasts for growth in non-mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness investment over the medium term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that a lack of ‘animal spirits’ following the global financial crisis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprobably helped explain why non-mining business investment had not been as strong as expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover this period. Differences in the paths of non-mining business investment across states\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that negative spillovers from the decline in mining investment since 2013 were an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant part of the explanation. Financing constraints may also have played a role.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the labour market, members noted that the improved conditions over 2017 had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed by a further rise in employment in January. The unemployment rate was 5.5 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the level it had been over the preceding five months. Business survey measures of hiring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions and job advertisements pointed to a continuation of above-average growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment over the coming months. The participation rate remained elevated and was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly higher than a year earlier. The increase in the participation rate over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious year or so had been strongest for women aged between 25 and 44 years and older men.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that participation rates for these groups tended to increase when labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were strong and observed that the trend towards less physically demanding work and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timprovements in health outcomes were also likely to have contributed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWages growth had remained low. The wage price index had increased by 0.6 per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe December quarter and growth over the year had increased slightly to 2.1 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcross the states, wages growth had risen to almost 2½ per cent in Victoria,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in Queensland and Western Australia had increased from the lows recorded during 2016/17. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrast, wages growth in New South Wales had been steady at around 2 per cent for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcouple of years, despite the strong labour market conditions in that state.

Short-term borrowing rates in US money markets had also increased since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstart of the year, in part reflecting the significant issuance of Treasury bills by the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTreasury in early 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that market pricing indicated market participants' expectations had risen to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe broadly consistent with the median of projections of members of the Federal Open Market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommittee (FOMC) from the December 2017 meeting, which implied three increases in the federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds rate in 2018.

They also noted that the sharp increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequity market volatility early in February had been mostly reversed, and volatility in financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets generally remained at or a little below longer-run averages. The spread between yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton non-investment grade corporate bonds and government bonds had remained close to the low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels reached before the onset of the financial crisis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial conditions remained accommodative in emerging markets despite flows into equity and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond funds having reversed temporarily at the time of the recent period of equity market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatility.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the US dollar had depreciated noticeably against most currencies since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning of 2017, although it had appreciated a little in February alongside the declines in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal equity markets. The Japanese yen had also appreciated over the preceding month.

The slowing in housing credit growth had been most pronounced for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending to investors, in part reflecting the prudential measures introduced by the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrudential Regulation Authority relating to interest-only lending, which is more common among\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors.

At the aggregate level,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, the likely increase in loan-related payments would amount to a small proportion of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold disposable income and the effect on household consumption growth would be smaller\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market pricing continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring 2018, with a 25 basis point increase expected in the first half of 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that overall conditions in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal economy had continued to improve. The upswing had been broadly based and global spare\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity had continued to fall. Many advanced economies had been growing at above-trend rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand unemployment rates were below estimates consistent with full employment. In China, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities had continued to work on reducing financial stability risks and improving the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustainability of growth in output, and recent announcements suggested the current direction of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy would be maintained in 2018. The pick-up in the global economy had contributed to a rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin oil and other commodity prices over the preceding year. Nonetheless, Australia's terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade were expected to decline over the following few years but remain at a relatively high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobally, inflation remained low, but there had been some signs of inflationary pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding. Further inflationary pressures were in prospect in the United States, where fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy was expected to be more expansionary in the context of limited spare capacity. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tled to some adjustments to financial market pricing, most notably an increase in longer-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yields in the advanced economies.

Employment had grown strongly and the unemployment rate had fallen over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding year. However, the improvement in overall conditions had not yet translated into a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefinitive pick-up in wages growth, which remained low. Forward-looking indicators suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat spare capacity in the labour market would continue to decline gradually over 2018 and, as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequence, wages growth was expected to rise gradually.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had slowed in preceding months and conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing markets elsewhere had been relatively stable.

Although household debt was still considered high,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers saw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly a limited risk of excessive borrowing at the current juncture: household disposable income\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(and thus borrowing capacity) is weak; the memory of recent housing price falls is still fresh;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks are still quite cautious in their appetite to lend.

The outlook for global growth was\n\t\t\t\tbeing supported by accommodative financial conditions.</p>", "<p>In the advanced economies, GDP growth had slowed over the preceding year or so and was forecast to slow\n\t\t\t\ta little further to be around, or somewhat below, trend in 2020. In the United States, GDP growth was at\n\t\t\t\tor above trend; consumption growth had been resilient and residential construction activity had picked\n\t\t\t\tup, although business investment had declined. In the euro area, subdued growth had reflected weak\n\t\t\t\texternal demand and weak production in the automotive industry. Members noted that the introduction of\n\t\t\t\tnew emissions testing and weak global demand for passenger vehicles had contributed to the decline in\n\t\t\t\texports and car production in the euro area since mid 2018. In Japan, growth was expected to slow\n\t\t\t\tfrom an above-trend pace following an increase in the consumption tax in October. The Japanese economy\n\t\t\t\twas also facing slowing external demand, particularly from other parts of Asia.</p>", "<p>In east Asia, GDP growth had been subdued in the September quarter, most notably in the more\n\t\t\t\texport-oriented economies, given their close integration into global supply chains. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\tweak global demand for memory circuits had dampened growth in South Korea and Singapore, while political\n\t\t\t\tunrest had contributed to a fall in output in Hong Kong. Growth in output had been relatively resilient\n\t\t\t\tin the less export-oriented economies. Some governments in the region had offered incentives for\n\t\t\t\tproduction to relocate from China in response to the trade disputes. There had been further signs of\n\t\t\t\tweakness in the Indian economy, mostly unrelated to the slowing in global trade, which authorities had\n\t\t\t\ttried to offset through both monetary and fiscal stimulus.</p>", "<p>In China, GDP had increased at an annual rate of 6 per cent in the September quarter, largely\n\t\t\t\tas expected, with slower growth in domestic demand. Members noted that growth in nominal GDP had also\n\t\t\t\tslowed and that this had implications for debt-servicing capacity. Bilateral trade with the United\n\t\t\t\tStates had contracted further, but, overall, external demand had been steadier and net exports had been\n\t\t\t\tpositive for Chinese growth more recently. Policy measures had continued to support growth and had been\n\t\t\t\ttilted towards steel-intensive activities. This had supported Chinese steel production and, in turn,\n\t\t\t\tdemand for Australian bulk commodities. There remained ongoing uncertainty about how these policy\n\t\t\t\tmeasures and trade tensions with the United States would affect growth in China. As had been the case\n\t\t\t\tfor some time, the mix of policy measures was also an important consideration for how Australia's\n\t\t\t\texports and terms of trade might be affected.</p>", "<p>Movements in commodity prices had been mixed since the previous meeting. Iron ore prices had declined\n\t\t\t\tin response to expectations of lower near-term demand. Oil, coal and base metals prices had increased a\n\t\t\t\tlittle in October. Overall, the terms of trade for the September quarter had been revised a little\n\t\t\t\thigher. They were still expected to decline gradually over the following few years because global demand\n\t\t\t\tfor bulk commodities was expected to ease and more supply was expected to become available.</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>Quarterly GDP growth had picked up a little since its low point in the second half of 2018 and was\n\t\t\t\texpected to have been moderate in the September quarter. Members noted that the forecasts for growth and\n\t\t\t\tthe labour market had been largely unchanged from those presented in August. Growth in output was\n\t\t\t\texpected to increase to 2¾ per cent over 2020 and around 3 per cent over 2021,\n\t\t\t\tsupported by accommodative monetary policy, the low- and middle-income tax offset, improved conditions\n\t\t\t\tin the established housing market, ongoing spending on infrastructure and a pick-up in mining\n\t\t\t\tinvestment. Exports and public spending were also expected to contribute to growth over the forecast\n\t\t\t\tperiod. One near-term downside risk to the Australian economy could be a larger-than-expected\n\t\t\t\tcontraction in housing construction activity. Further out, the risks to the growth outlook were more\n\t\t\t\tbalanced.</p>", "<p>Retail sales volumes had declined in the September quarter, which suggested that consumption growth was\n\t\t\t\tlikely to have remained subdued in recent months despite the tax offset payments and the reductions in\n\t\t\t\tinterest rates. Although some liaison contacts had reported a modest pick-up in sales growth, they had\n\t\t\t\tfound it difficult to attribute this to a specific cause given other factors at play, such as the\n\t\t\t\tpass-through of the exchange rate depreciation. Consumer sentiment had fallen to below-average levels\n\t\t\t\tover recent months.</p>", "<p>Growth in consumption was expected to increase over the forecast period, supported by some recovery in\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in household income and the turnaround in prices in the established housing market. Growth in\n\t\t\t\thousehold disposable income was forecast to increase, because labour market conditions were expected to\n\t\t\t\tcontinue to support labour income and the recent monetary policy easing and tax offsets would lower\n\t\t\t\thousehold interest and tax payments. In the near term, however, forecast growth in household income had\n\t\t\t\tbeen revised slightly lower, partly to reflect the effects of the drought on farm incomes and the\n\t\t\t\tdownturn in housing construction on related businesses, as well as continuing evidence of strong tax\n\t\t\t\tcollections. Overall, although there remained considerable uncertainty around the outlook for\n\t\t\t\tconsumption growth, the medium-term risks were considered to be balanced.</p>", "<p>Members noted that housing market conditions had continued to strengthen in Sydney and Melbourne, and\n\t\t\t\tconditions appeared to have firmed in other cities, including Brisbane. However, housing market\n\t\t\t\tconditions had remained weak in Perth and Darwin. In Sydney and Melbourne, housing prices had been on an\n\t\t\t\tupward trajectory since June, the number of auctions had increased and auction clearance rates had been\n\t\t\t\tat relatively high levels. Housing turnover had remained low across the capital cities, although there\n\t\t\t\thad been signs that turnover was starting to rise.</p>", "<p>Despite the stronger-than-expected pick-up in established housing markets, there had been little\n\t\t\t\tevidence of a lift in the early stages of residential development activity. In the near term, the risks\n\t\t\t\tto growth from dwelling investment were tilted to the downside. Building approvals had declined in the\n\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter, to be more than 20 per cent lower over the year. Liaison with industry\n\t\t\t\tparticipants suggested that the recent improvement in housing market conditions had not yet translated\n\t\t\t\tinto stronger sales for new housing. A larger-than-expected contraction in dwelling investment could\n\t\t\t\tdelay the gradual improvement in GDP growth. Members noted that the recent strengthening in housing\n\t\t\t\tmarket conditions would support building activity in time. The lagged response to higher housing prices\n\t\t\t\tand a period of low building activity had raised the likelihood that dwelling investment would be\n\t\t\t\tstronger in the medium term than currently expected.</p>", "<p>Recent indicators pointed to ongoing support for non-residential construction activity over the\n\t\t\t\tfollowing year or so. Non-residential building approvals had increased in recent months and the pipeline\n\t\t\t\tof work for both non-residential building and private infrastructure had remained at a high level.\n\t\t\t\tBusiness conditions had been around average since the beginning of the year. Mining-related activity was\n\t\t\t\texpected to increase over the forecast period and it was possible that mining investment could be\n\t\t\t\tstronger than expected towards the end of the forecast period. In contrast, members noted that rural\n\t\t\t\tconditions had remained difficult in many parts of the country and that the outlook for rural exports\n\t\t\t\tover the following year had been downgraded.</p>", "<p>Employment had continued to grow strongly, at 2.5 per cent in year-ended terms. The\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had been 5.2 per cent in September, which was little changed since April.\n\t\t\t\tThe employment-to-population ratio had continued to rise and was at its highest level since 2008.\n\t\t\t\tLeading indicators suggested that labour demand would be around average over the following six months.\n\t\t\t\tThe outlook for the labour market had been little changed since August. Employment growth was expected\n\t\t\t\tto ease over the forecast period, but to remain above growth in the working-age population. The\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate was forecast to decline to be just under 5 per cent in late 2021, which was\n\t\t\t\tstill above estimates of full employment.</p>", "<p>Wages growth was expected to remain around its recent rate over the forecast period. A large share of\n\t\t\t\tfirms in the Bank's liaison program had continued to report that they expect wages growth to remain\n\t\t\t\taround this rate over the year ahead and very few firms expect higher wages growth. New enterprise\n\t\t\t\tbargaining agreements were still generally delivering lower wage outcomes than the agreements they were\n\t\t\t\treplacing. Public sector wages growth was also expected to be constrained over the forecast period,\n\t\t\t\towing to ongoing government caps on wage increases.</p>", "<p>Inflation in the September quarter had been in line with forecasts presented in August and confirmed\n\t\t\t\tthat inflationary pressures remained subdued. CPI inflation had been 0.3 per cent in the\n\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter and 1.7 per cent over the year. Trimmed mean inflation had been low and\n\t\t\t\tsteady at 1.6 per cent in year-ended terms, which was consistent with slow output growth,\n\t\t\t\tcontinued spare capacity in the labour market and weak housing market conditions weighing on\n\t\t\t\thousing-related prices.</p>", "<p>In the September quarter, housing-related consumer prices had remained very subdued. New dwelling\n\t\t\t\tprices had declined for the third consecutive quarter. Rent inflation had remained low because of the\n\t\t\t\tstrong supply of rental housing, particularly in Sydney. Electricity prices had fallen as a result of\n\t\t\t\tregulatory changes in the quarter. Overall, inflation in non-tradable items had been steady. In\n\t\t\t\tcontrast, tradable inflation (excluding volatile items) had picked up in the quarter, reflecting\n\t\t\t\tcontinued pass-through of the earlier exchange rate depreciation to retail prices; the prices of\n\t\t\t\tconsumer durables had risen over the previous four quarters, following a decade of declining prices.\n\t\t\t\tGrocery price inflation had also picked up, driven by the ongoing effect of the drought on food prices.\n\t\t\t\tMembers noted that meat prices had also been supported by strong demand from China to replace lost\n\t\t\t\tdomestic pork production as a result of African swine flu and were likely to remain high for some time\n\t\t\t\tafter the drought breaks, given that it would take time to rebuild herds.</p>", "<p>Underlying and headline inflation were expected to increase to around 2 per cent by the end\n\t\t\t\tof 2021. Inflationary pressures were expected to pick up in response to above-trend growth in output and\n\t\t\t\tgradually tightening labour market conditions. However, the upward pressure on prices from the earlier\n\t\t\t\texchange rate depreciation and the drought was expected to be temporary, although there was some\n\t\t\t\tuncertainty around the persistence of these effects. Utilities price inflation was expected to be below\n\t\t\t\taverage over the following few years and could be lower than forecast as more renewable energy capacity\n\t\t\t\tcomes on line. New dwelling inflation was expected to remain subdued until construction activity\n\t\t\t\trecovers later in the forecast period. Rent inflation was expected to increase from its recent low rate\n\t\t\t\tgiven that ongoing population growth was expected to be higher than growth in the housing stock.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the risks to the wage and price inflation forecasts were balanced. Wages could\n\t\t\t\tincrease more quickly than forecast if the pick-up in output growth erodes spare capacity more quickly\n\t\t\t\tthan anticipated. However, an extended period of low wages growth and inflation could mean that\n\t\t\t\twage-setting norms would be slow to move higher. Members observed that a further gradual lift in wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth would be needed for inflation to be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target\n\t\t\t\trange.</p>", "<p>Members considered a detailed review of how the economy had evolved over the preceding year relative to\n\t\t\t\tthe Bank's forecasts for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation. Over the year since the November\n\t\t\t\t2018 forecasts, GDP growth had been much weaker than expected. Inflation had also been lower than\n\t\t\t\tforecast. The extent and breadth of the spillovers from the housing downturn – particularly for\n\t\t\t\tconsumption, household income, dwelling investment and inflation – had been an important driver\n\t\t\t\tof these outcomes. These spillovers had mostly been identified at the time as downside risks to the\n\t\t\t\tforecasts, but their extent had been considerably larger than expected. Despite the slower-than-expected\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in output, there had been sustained strength in employment growth, which had been met with\n\t\t\t\tgreater labour force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate had been only marginally higher\n\t\t\t\tthan forecast and there had been little upward pressure on wages.</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members noted that global financial conditions remained accommodative. Market sentiment had improved\n\t\t\t\t\ta little since the previous meeting, following signs of an easing of some concerns about the downside\n\t\t\t\t\trisks for the global economy.</p>", "<p>While a number of central banks had eased policy in recent months, expectations for additional easing\n\t\t\t\t\thad been scaled back. As widely expected, the US Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate by\n\t\t\t\t\t25 basis points in October, the third successive meeting at which policy rates had been reduced.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Federal Reserve noted the decision had been based on the implications of global developments for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures. However, it also noted that the US economy\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to perform solidly and that it would take a material change in the outlook for the Federal\n\t\t\t\t\tReserve to adjust policy settings further. After announcing a broad-based stimulus package in\n\t\t\t\t\tSeptember, the European Central Bank left policy settings unchanged at its October meeting, but stated\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it was prepared to ease policy further if necessary. The People's Bank of China continued to\n\t\t\t\t\temploy a range of targeted measures to maintain accommodative financing conditions in support of\n\t\t\t\t\teconomic activity, including further cuts to banks' required reserve ratios.</p>", "<p>During October, government bond yields had increased modestly in a wide range of economies, including\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralia. The increase followed positive developments in the US–China disputes and Brexit\n\t\t\t\t\tnegotiations, and was associated with the scaling back of expectations for further monetary policy\n\t\t\t\t\tstimulus. Nevertheless, government bond yields remained close to the very low levels reached in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle of the year.</p>", "<p>Financing conditions for corporations remained accommodative. Globally, equity prices had increased,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the US market was at a record high. Spreads on corporate bonds were low. In Australia, growth in\n\t\t\t\t\tbusiness debt had slowed, reflecting softer demand for funding from large businesses, while credit\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions for small and medium-sized businesses remained tight.</p>", "<p>The US dollar and Japanese yen had depreciated a little over October (after having appreciated\n\t\t\t\t\tover the previous few years) in response to the easing in concerns about global downside risks. After\n\t\t\t\t\tdepreciating over much of 2019, the Chinese renminbi had appreciated somewhat in recent times. The\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar had appreciated slightly in October, but remained at the lower end of its range over\n\t\t\t\t\trecent times.</p>", "<p>In Australia, banks' funding costs had declined following the reductions in the cash rate, which\n\t\t\t\t\thad been reflected in short-term money market rates and deposit rates over recent months. Members\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the range of pricing on deposits. While close to a quarter of deposits were estimated to be\n\t\t\t\t\tearning interest at rates between 0 and 50 basis points, most deposits earned interest at\n\t\t\t\t\trates over 1 per cent. Following the cumulative 75 basis point reduction in the cash\n\t\t\t\t\trate this year, banks were estimated to have lowered the interest rates on at-call retail deposits by\n\t\t\t\t\tan average of 60 to 70 basis points.</p>", "<p>Borrowing rates for households and businesses were at historic lows. A large share of the recent\n\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy easing had been passed through to mortgage rates paid by households. After passing\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough most of the June and July cash rate cuts to standard variable mortgage rates (SVRs), financial\n\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions had passed through less of the October rate cut, bringing the total reduction in SVRs\n\t\t\t\t\tsince June to around 60 basis points. Strong competition for high-quality borrowers had led to\n\t\t\t\t\trates for new and refinanced loans being lower than for existing loans. In addition, borrowers were\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuing to switch from interest-only loans to lower-rate principal-and-interest loans. This meant\n\t\t\t\t\tthat average outstanding mortgage rates had declined by around 65 basis points since the middle of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe year. This process was expected to continue.</p>", "<p>Consistent with the improvements in some housing markets, housing loan approvals had risen strongly\n\t\t\t\t\tsince May, driven largely by approvals to owner-occupiers. Members noted that there was strong\n\t\t\t\t\tcompetition for borrowers of high credit quality. Despite this, the pace of growth in housing credit\n\t\t\t\t\tfor owner-occupiers had picked up only slightly, while the stock of housing credit for investors had\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to decline a little. This implied that the increase in new loans over recent months had been\n\t\t\t\t\taccompanied by faster repayment of existing loans, as usually occurs in the months immediately\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowing an interest rate reduction.</p>", "<p>Financial market pricing implied that expectations for a further reduction in the cash rate had been\n\t\t\t\t\tscaled back since the previous meeting, with some chance of a 25 basis point reduction around the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle of 2020.</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>Turning to the policy decision, members observed that while the outlook for the global economy remained\n\t\t\t\treasonable, the risks continued to be tilted to the downside. Although there had been some recent\n\t\t\t\tprogress in resolving the US–China trade and technology disputes, there was still the potential\n\t\t\t\tfor re-escalation. In the major advanced economies, inflation remained subdued despite low unemployment\n\t\t\t\trates and a lift in wages growth. In China, the authorities had taken steps to support the economy while\n\t\t\t\tcontinuing to address risks in the financial system.</p>", "<p>Global financial conditions remained accommodative, and market sentiment had improved a little despite\n\t\t\t\tongoing concerns about the economic outlook. While a number of central banks had eased policy recently,\n\t\t\t\texpectations for additional easing had declined over the prior month. Government bond yields remained\n\t\t\t\tvery low in many economies, including Australia. Borrowing rates for households and businesses in\n\t\t\t\tAustralia were also at historically low levels and there was strong competition for borrowers of high\n\t\t\t\tcredit quality. There were further signs of a turnaround in established housing markets, although demand\n\t\t\t\tfor credit by investors had remained subdued and credit conditions for some firms, especially small and\n\t\t\t\tmedium-sized businesses, remained tight. The Australian dollar was at the lower end of its range over\n\t\t\t\trecent times.</p>", "<p>The outlook for the Australian economy was little changed since August. After a soft period in the\n\t\t\t\tsecond half of 2018, GDP growth had picked up a little in the first half of 2019 and it appeared that a\n\t\t\t\tgentle turning point had been reached. Looking forward, growth was expected to strengthen gradually to\n\t\t\t\t2¾ per cent over 2020 and around 3 per cent over 2021. This outlook was\n\t\t\t\texpected to be supported by accommodative monetary policy, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on\n\t\t\t\tinfrastructure, the upswing in housing prices in some markets and a pick-up in mining investment. An\n\t\t\t\timportant domestic uncertainty continued to be the outlook for consumption, with the sustained period of\n\t\t\t\tonly modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending.</p>", "<p>Employment had continued to grow strongly and had been matched by strong growth in labour supply. The\n\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had remained steady at around 5¼ per cent and was expected to decline\n\t\t\t\tonly gradually. Spare capacity was likely to remain in the labour market for some years. Wages growth\n\t\t\t\thad remained subdued and was expected to remain at around its current rate for some time yet. Members\n\t\t\t\tagreed that a further gradual lift in wages growth would be a welcome development and was needed for\n\t\t\t\tinflation to be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target range.</p>", "<p>In the September quarter, inflation had been broadly as expected at 1.7 per cent over the\n\t\t\t\tyear. Inflationary pressures had remained subdued, held down by very low housing-related prices and slow\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in labour costs and administered prices. Over time, inflation was expected to increase gradually\n\t\t\t\tin response to some tightening in labour market conditions, to be close to 2 per cent in 2020\n\t\t\t\tand 2021.</p>", "<p>Given this outlook, members considered how best to respond.</p>", "<p>The Board agreed that a case could be made to ease monetary policy at this meeting, but that the most\n\t\t\t\tappropriate approach would be to maintain the current stance of monetary policy and to make another full\n\t\t\t\tassessment once more evidence of the effects of the earlier monetary easing had become available. Global\n\t\t\t\tfinancial markets were signalling a decline in pessimism, which, if sustained, could lead to better than\n\t\t\t\texpected outcomes for the global economy. The significant easing of monetary policy in Australia since\n\t\t\t\tthe middle of the year was supporting employment and income growth and a gradual return of inflation to\n\t\t\t\tthe medium-term target range. The established housing market was picking up, which would have positive\n\t\t\t\tspillovers for the broader economy, although the size of these spillovers was uncertain. Further\n\t\t\t\tevidence on spending by households was required before drawing a conclusion on the effects of the tax\n\t\t\t\tcuts and low interest rates. Having already delivered a substantial monetary stimulus in recent months,\n\t\t\t\tthere was a case to wait and assess the effects of this stimulus, especially given the long and variable\n\t\t\t\tlags.</p>", "<p>In reaching this conclusion, members reviewed the case for a further reduction at the present meeting.\n\t\t\t\tThis case largely rested on only gradual progress having been made towards the Bank's goals. While\n\t\t\t\tmembers judged that lower interest rates were supporting the economy through the usual transmission\n\t\t\t\tchannels (including a lower exchange rate, higher asset prices and higher cash flows for borrowers),\n\t\t\t\tthey recognised the negative effects of lower interest rates on savers and confidence. They also\n\t\t\t\tdiscussed the possibility that a further reduction in interest rates could have a different effect on\n\t\t\t\tconfidence than in the past, when interest rates were at higher levels.</p>", "<p>The Board concluded that the cash rate should be held steady at this meeting. As part of their\n\t\t\t\tdeliberations, members also agreed that it was reasonable to expect that an extended period of low\n\t\t\t\tinterest rates would be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target.\n\t\t\t\tThe Board would continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and was prepared to\n\t\t\t\tease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and\n\t\t\t\tthe achievement of the inflation target over time.</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 0.75 per cent.</p>"]}},

The pick-up in growth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsynchronised across economies and was likely to be sustained in 2018, supported by accommodative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy across the globe and an upturn in international trade. The increase in demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor traded goods had been broadly based across regions and especially pronounced for commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texporters. Stronger economic growth had been accompanied by a further tightening of labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket conditions in many economies, and unemployment rates were low in a number of advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies.

Housing price inflation and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity in the residential property market had also eased over the preceding year, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the larger cities, consistent with policies to address buoyant housing market conditions and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdampen speculation.

Despite recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in the volatility of equity prices around the world, financial conditions continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe accommodative, with bond yields and credit spreads remaining at low levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, business conditions had improved over 2017 but growth in consumption had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a relatively modest pace, constrained by low household income growth despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger-than-expected employment growth and a decline in the unemployment rate over 2017. Even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the strength in the labour market, wage growth was yet to pick up. Inflation also remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow, but was expected to increase gradually as the economy strengthened and wage pressures rose\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the forecast period. Strong competition in the retail sector, which had placed downward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure on the prices of consumer durables and food for some time, was expected to persist in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing market conditions had generally eased in areas where growth had earlier been strong,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially in Sydney. Tighter credit standards, as a result of supervisory measures implemented\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, had been helpful in containing the build-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof risk on household balance sheets and housing credit growth had eased, particularly for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors. However, household debt levels remained elevated and members agreed that household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbalance sheets still warranted careful monitoring.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOver 2017, progress had been made in reducing the unemployment rate and bringing inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcloser to target. The low level of interest rates was continuing to play a role in achieving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis outcome. Further progress on these goals was expected over the period ahead but the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in inflation was likely to occur only gradually as the economy strengthened; the Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral forecast for the Australian economy was for GDP growth to pick up to average a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove 3 per cent over the next two years and for CPI inflation to be a little above 2 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2018.

Consumption and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining business investment had made significant contributions to growth. In contrast, there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been declines in mining and dwelling investment. GDP had not grown as solidly as domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand over 2017 because net exports had subtracted from growth. However, given the momentum in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic demand and expectations that the decline in export volumes would be temporary, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the economy appeared likely to record faster growth over 2018 than the previous year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousehold consumption had increased strongly in the December quarter and had been revised higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin preceding quarters. Members noted that following these revisions, consumption growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2017 had been more consistent with the strength seen in the labour market over that period. More\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently, growth in retail sales values had been below average in early 2018. At least some of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis was likely to reflect ongoing retail price deflation, owing to strong competition in this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. Consumer confidence had declined a little over recent months, but remained above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in household disposable income had picked up over 2017, partly reflecting the strength in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth over the course of the year. Income of unincorporated small businesses, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis attributed to the household sector, had increased in the December quarter. The national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounts measure of wages growth had continued to be lower than wages growth recorded in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twage price index. This suggested that compositional changes in the labour force had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave a dampening effect on household earnings. By sector, the national accounts measure of wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had picked up significantly for business services, but had fallen further for household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices. At the same time, there had been strong employment growth in the household services\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, as well as for goods-related industries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that year-ended growth in employment had remained strong in the first few months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2018, although the monthly increases in employment had moderated. Nationwide, employment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to grow strongly in the household services sector, particularly in the health and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsocial assistance industry. Employment in goods-related industries had picked up sharply over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year to February, mainly reflecting strength in construction employment. Members observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat migration flows from Western Australia had served to mitigate the effect of the end of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmining investment boom on the labour market in that state. The national employment-to-population\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratio had remained at a high level, as employment growth had been strong enough to absorb growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the working-age population, although not high enough to reduce the unemployment rate further.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unemployment rate had been little changed over the preceding six months at around 5½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand measures of underemployment had remained at relatively high levels. Taken together, these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators suggested that there was still some spare capacity in the labour market. Leading\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators continued to point to above-average growth in employment in the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the residential housing market, dwelling investment had declined a little over 2017 but was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to remain at a high level over the following year or so, supported by the large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpipeline of residential construction work yet to be completed associated with the increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential building approvals over 2017. Housing prices had declined further in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne. Members noted that Sydney housing prices had declined by a little under 5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince their peak in mid 2017. Members also noted that declines in housing prices of around 10 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some cities had occurred several times over the preceding 15 years or so. Over recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing prices had been little changed in Brisbane and Perth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that most components of business investment had increased over 2017, with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texception of construction activity in the mining sector. Private non-mining business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased by more than 12 per cent. Public spending had supported growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic activity over 2017 and this momentum was expected to continue in the period ahead. Data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton firms' capital expenditure plans and on the pipeline of non-residential construction work\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyet to be done also suggested that non-mining business investment was expected to grow solidly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the following few years. Consistent with this, survey measures indicated that business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had been around record highs and above average in all industries and states.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExport volumes had fallen in the December quarter. The decline in coal exports was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treverse gradually over the first half of 2018 as shipments from Queensland recover following a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of temporary disruptions. Rural export volumes had fallen as a result of lower crop\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction, which was unlikely to be reversed in the near term. Members noted that the spot\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices of iron ore and coal had declined significantly since the previous meeting, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns about the resilience of Chinese iron ore and coal demand after the Chinese New Year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholiday period, although contract prices for coal had increased. Concerns that an escalation in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal trade protectionism could damage prospects for global growth had also contributed to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower commodity prices. In contrast, the price of oil had increased in recent weeks. Recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in commodity prices suggested that the terms of trade for Australia had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged in the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a backdrop to their discussion on international economic conditions, members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal industrial activity and trade had strengthened over the prior couple of years. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved that although the tariff announcements by the US administration – and by the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities in response – were unlikely to have a significant direct effect on global trade, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossibility of an escalation in trade restrictions represented a risk to the global outlook that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneeded to be monitored closely.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbove-trend growth in the major advanced economies had led to a further tightening in labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets. Business conditions had remained around their highest levels in several years, despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving declined from their peaks in Europe recently. In the United States, fiscal stimulus was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to support growth in output over the period ahead and was likely to add to inflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures as the US economy encountered capacity constraints. Actual and expected growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twages in the advanced economies had increased but remained low. Core inflation had also remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow, although it had picked up over recent months in the United States and Japan, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflationary pressures were expected to build in the major advanced economies in the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the authorities had recently announced a growth target of around 6.5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor 2018, which was similar to the target for 2017, and a continuation of policies designed to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduce pollution and manage financial stability risks. Members recognised that economic data for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina were difficult to interpret early in the calendar year owing to the effect of the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNew Year holidays. Nevertheless, the available data suggested that private investment growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up but remained low. Growth in industrial output had also been subdued, partly because of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicies designed to reduce excess capacity and pollution. However, indicators of consumer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending suggested that consumption growth would continue to run above GDP growth, even though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption growth had eased in recent years. Growth in total social financing had eased in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprior months and housing prices had fallen in the largest cities where housing market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestrictions had been most prominent; growth in dwelling investment in these cities had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderated. Nationwide, conditions in the housing market had been broadly stable.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn some parts of east Asia, output growth had been a little slower around the turn of the year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting an easing in export growth in particular. However, more recent data suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic demand conditions had been somewhat stronger in early 2018 in the high-income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. In India, growth had increased over 2017, driven by strong growth in investment;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in exports of business and financial services had also picked up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected, the US Federal Reserve had raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had published upwardly revised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojections for the US economy and a slightly steeper path for expected future policy rates than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously, partly owing to the US fiscal stimulus. The median of the FOMC's revised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojections implied that the policy rate will reach a neutral stance in 2019, and move a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the FOMC's estimate of the neutral rate in 2020. Financial market pricing suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket participants expected a more modest increase in the policy rate over 2019 and 2020.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that long-term government bond yields in the United States and some other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies had risen over the preceding six months, but had declined a little recently, in part\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting a slight lowering of inflation expectations. Share prices had fallen over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding month, reflecting concerns about international trade policy developments, as well as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregulatory and company-specific developments in the technology sector. Australian equity prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad moved broadly in line with global markets, with prices of resources sector stocks having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined in response to lower commodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers also observed that corporate bond spreads in the United States and euro area had risen a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle over March, which was likely to have reflected investor concerns about trade policies and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduced demand for corporate debt relating to US tax changes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed developments in US dollar money markets, noting the marked increase in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost of borrowing US dollars at short terms since the beginning of 2018. The increase in US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar short-term interest rates appeared to have reflected a number of factors, including a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharp increase in US Treasury bill issuance in the early part of the year and changes to US tax\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangements, which had encouraged US subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions to source\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore of their funding from onshore US money markets. In addition, demand for a range of money\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket instruments from a number of large US corporations was thought to have declined following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanges to US tax arrangements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the developments in US money markets had flowed through to higher short-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing costs in financial markets in Australia. In part, this reflected the use by Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks of funds raised in US markets to finance their domestic assets, in contrast to banks from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother jurisdictions, which funded US dollar assets with the funds raised. There had also been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome flow-through to short-term interest rates in a few other markets, though to a lesser\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\textent. Futures pricing suggested that these pressures in US money markets were expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabate somewhat over the coming months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the announced reorganisation of Chinese financial regulatory agencies, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas designed to strengthen oversight and reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage. The changes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere consistent with greater policy coordination and a continued focus on reducing risks in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese financial system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been fairly modest movements in most major exchange rates over the previous month. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar had depreciated a little further against the US dollar and in trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms, but remained within the relatively narrow range of the preceding two years. The recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation had occurred in the context of lower commodity prices and interest rates in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States having moved above those in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, corporate bond spreads had risen slightly over the preceding month, in line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in international markets, but remained at relatively low levels. Major banks'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnet bond issuance had been relatively strong over 2018 to date. Members noted that major banks'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarginal cost of debt funding had increased a little over the preceding month, reflecting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher cost of borrowing in short-term money markets related to the developments in US money\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets. At the same time, there had been little change in retail deposit rates, limiting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverall effect on bank funding costs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in housing credit had stabilised in 2018, having slowed over the course of 2017, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata on loan approvals suggested that banks had comfortably met the requirements of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) in relation to interest-only lending. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that there had been a number of reductions in banks' advertised interest rates on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestor and interest-only mortgages over the preceding month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market pricing continued to imply that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a considerable period, with a 25 basis point increase expected in mid 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Stability": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the Bank's regular half-yearly assessment of the financial system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt the margin, global financial stability risks had eased. Stronger economic growth had improved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks' loan performance and underlying profitability. For some banks, the increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofits had also reflected the absence of large asset write-downs, fines and restructuring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpenses, which had affected previous outcomes. In China, the authorities had taken measures to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontain the risks to the financial system emanating from the high level of debt and some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher-risk forms of credit intermediation, although risks to the stability of the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial system remained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLow risk-free interest rates continued to underpin the valuations of many assets around the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworld. Members noted that a sharp increase in interest rates toward historically more normal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels that is not associated with stronger growth could see simultaneous price falls across a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trange of assets. In addition, investors had been accepting low levels of compensation for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbearing risk, so a reassessment of this would accentuate possible price falls for risky assets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPast episodes had shown that such price falls could be large for equities and high-yield\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporate bonds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing markets had been strong in a number of small open economies that did not experience\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant housing market downturns during the financial crisis, including Australia. Low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates had contributed to strong growth in household borrowing and housing prices in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese countries. National authorities had implemented ‘macroprudential’ measures to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurtail the associated build-up in risks. Members discussed these prudential measures more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly, observing that the frameworks differed across countries and were still evolving.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeasuring the effectiveness of these policies was difficult. Internationally they had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccessfully constrained the type of borrowing targeted, although in some instances there was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswitching of activity to other forms of finance. While governance arrangements varied across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries, members noted that the strength of the relationships among the different agencies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvolved was crucial to the smooth operation and effectiveness of these policies. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat an important aspect of the arrangements in Australia was the strong relationships among the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregulatory agencies, supported by the Council of Financial Regulators. The Reserve Bank and APRA\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad worked closely to address risks in the housing market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, risks remained from the high level of household debt and the growth of riskier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending in earlier years, but regulatory measures had helped to contain the build-up of risks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that while the growth of household debt had outpaced that of income over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears, household net wealth had continued to grow and, in aggregate, households' housing and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial assets far exceeded their borrowing. Members noted, however, that this was not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflective of the financial positions of all individual households. Nevertheless, measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold financial stress did not indicate a high level of financial stress at present. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso noted that the share of interest-only loans in new lending had fallen sharply and the share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof loans with high loan-to-valuation ratios had also declined since the regulatory measures were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplemented by APRA, which had further tightened lending standards. Housing prices had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney, and to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Price falls had been larger for more expensive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproperties, suggesting that the regulatory measures, which would have had a greater impact on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors and therefore prices of apartments and cheaper dwellings, had not been the sole\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrivers of the slowdown. Members noted that a number of structural factors had also been at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to developments in the commercial property sector, members noted that office property\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had been strongest in Sydney and Melbourne, where the limited net increase in supply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand robust tenant demand had pushed vacancy rates to low levels. Prices had continued to rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaster than rents, with sale prices implying very low rental yields for some properties,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough overall the spread of commercial property yields to government bond yields had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithin its historical range. Demand had been strong from both domestic and international buyers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRents for retail properties had not increased, reflecting the strong competition retailers were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfacing. In this environment, some retail property was being re-purposed to include a greater mix\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof entertainment and hospitality services or to incorporate a greater residential component.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the resilience of the Australian financial system had continued to improve.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian banks' profits had increased in the latest half-year period. Growth in profits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been driven by a wider net interest margin and a decline in bad and doubtful debt charges.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank analysts generally expected the contribution of these factors to profit growth to dissipate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the near term. Banks' asset performance remained robust, with non-performing loan ratios\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalling for business lending and remaining low for housing lending. Members noted that loan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperformance remained weaker in Western Australia, reflecting the end of the mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboom in that state. However, they observed that the deterioration in loan performance had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively modest given the significant decline in economic activity and decline in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices in the state.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe capital ratios of Australian banks had risen further over the preceding half-year and were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstantially higher than a decade prior. Further, a greater share of this was high-quality\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital. The capital ratios of the four major banks were well above the current regulatory\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tminimum and close to the ‘unquestionably strong’ prudential benchmark to apply from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2020. The increase in banks' capital ratios had reflected retained profits and subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in risk-weighted assets as the large banks had reduced the size of their non-mortgage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tportfolios, which carry higher risk weights. Banks continued to hold a large stock of liquid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets, well exceeding the requirements under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the proposed revisions to the capital framework outlined in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsultation paper released by APRA in February 2018. The proposal would see changes in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital required for different loans to make the capital requirement more sensitive to the risk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the loans, but would not raise the aggregate capital requirement for the industry. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the banking sector was the subject of several inquiries, the outcomes of which could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffect how they operate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that conditions in the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy had remained positive in the preceding month. Output in the advanced economies was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to continue to grow at above-trend rates, supported by accommodative monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, in the case of the United States, more expansionary fiscal policy. Over time, this was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to lead to even tighter labour market conditions and further upward pressure on labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts. Globally, inflation remained low, but was expected to increase. A number of central banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad withdrawn some monetary stimulus and further steps in this direction were expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, recent policy announcements were consistent with the trend towards a more sustainable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth path. Of particular note was the ongoing commitment to reducing financial stability risks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough changes to policy and the regulatory structure. Members noted that the high level of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt in China and the significant share of financial market activity in unregulated sectors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to pose important risks to the outlook for the Chinese economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLong-term bond yields had risen in the United States and some other economies over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsix months and credit spreads had widened a little recently, but financial conditions generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained expansionary. There had been some tightening of conditions in US dollar short-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney markets, which had flowed through to higher short-term interest rates in a few other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries, including Australia. Equity market volatility had increased from very low levels,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly because of concerns about the direction of trade policy internationally. The Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar had declined a little since the previous meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, the recent data had generally been consistent with the forecast for a gradual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timprovement in growth. The outlook for non-mining business investment growth remained positive,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by solid domestic demand conditions, the spillover from public infrastructure work and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pipeline of non-residential building work to be completed. Forward-looking indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that spare capacity in the labour market would continue to decline gradually over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018. Consequently, wages growth was expected to rise gradually from its current low rate. Low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in labour costs in combination with strong competition in the retail sector suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat inflation would remain low for some time before also picking up gradually as the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand labour market strengthen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had eased, while conditions in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets elsewhere had been relatively stable. Tighter credit standards and APRA's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupervisory measures had been helpful in containing the build-up of risk on household balance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheets. However, household debt levels remained high, which continued to pose an element of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty for the outlook for consumption growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe low level of interest rates had supported growth over 2017, which had reduced the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate and brought inflation closer to the target. Further progress on these goals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected in the period ahead, but this progress was likely to be gradual. Over 2018, GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was expected to exceed potential growth and CPI inflation was expected to increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually to be a little above 2 per cent. Members noted that an appreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in economic activity and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation than forecast.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn current circumstances, members agreed that it was more likely that the next move in the cash\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate would be up, rather than down. As progress in lowering unemployment and having inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn to the midpoint of the target was expected to be only gradual, members also agreed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Taking into account\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Stronger growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected over the following couple of years, which would reduce spare capacity in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy and lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate. This, in turn, was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to lead to a gradual pick-up in wages growth and inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The inflation data for the March quarter had been in line with the Bank's expectations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInflation had been ½ per cent in the quarter and close to 2 per cent over the year in both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theadline and underlying terms. The largest increases in prices over the year had been for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttobacco, following excise increases, and utilities, reflecting higher electricity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prices of tradable goods and services, excluding volatile items, had been declining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsince late 2016, despite the relative stability in the exchange rate over the preceding few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. Members observed that this was likely to reflect ongoing strong competition in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretail sector. Non-tradables inflation had remained a little above 3 per cent in year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterms. While non-tradables inflation had picked up over the preceding year, it remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than its average over the first decade of the 21st century. Members observed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspare capacity in the labour market and associated low wages growth had continued to keep\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation low, particularly for market services, which have a relatively high domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour cost component.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivate non-mining business investment had grown very strongly over 2017, driven by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential construction.

Survey measures of capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tutilisation had also continued to rise. An increasing proportion of businesses had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treporting that constraints on output were coming from premises and plant limitations and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tavailability of materials. Consistent with this, the NAB survey measure of expected capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpenditure had risen to above-average levels over the preceding year. The pipeline of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential construction work yet to be done had also increased, particularly for office\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuildings in Sydney and Melbourne, where tenant demand had been strong. Public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure spending had also continued to support growth in economic activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExport volumes looked to have recovered somewhat in early 2018, after declining in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports appeared to have increased strongly as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction ramped up in Western Australia, and coal export volumes had partially recovered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the supply disruptions in late 2017. Members noted that further growth in resource exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected as the remaining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLNG projects were completed and additional production capacity came on line. However, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletion of construction on these projects would largely offset the boost to economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth from this source.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prices of Australia's commodity exports, and thus the terms of trade, had been higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan expected a year earlier. However, prices were still expected to decline over the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tahead, as additional global supply of bulk commodities came on line. Members noted that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of trade were expected to remain high relative to the averages of prior decades,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting continued strong global demand for bulk commodities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the housing sector, dwelling investment was expected to remain at a high level over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod ahead, given the historically high pipeline of residential work yet to be done,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in New South Wales and Victoria. In established housing markets, housing prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad eased a little further in Sydney and Melbourne over preceding months, but had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed elsewhere.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members considered estimates of the median level of housing prices across the capital cities,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobserving that the relative ordering of price levels broadly corresponded to the sizes of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe populations across the cities. Members noted that housing prices in Sydney had tended to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave the most pronounced cycles over recent times and that median housing prices in Perth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere at a similar level to those in Brisbane, following the unwinding of the mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment boom.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Household consumption had grown solidly over 2017, and recent data on retail and motor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvehicle sales, as well as information from the Bank's liaison, suggested that this momentum\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued in early 2018.

The growth in employment in the first quarter of 2018\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been in part-time jobs, whereas increases in full-time jobs had driven overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth over 2017. The unemployment rate had remained around 5½ per cent since mid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017, as the growth in employment had been matched by a rise in the participation rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey measures of job vacancies and hiring intentions, as well as information from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBank's liaison, pointed to above-average employment growth in the near term. Consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, an increasing number of firms responding to the NAB business survey had been reporting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tavailability of suitable labour as a constraint on output. Members observed that growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe wage price index had not picked up as much or as quickly as its past correlation with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe NAB business survey measure of availability of suitable labour would have implied. A\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar divergence had also occurred in the corresponding data for the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed possible reasons for this divergence, including competitive pressures from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tglobalisation and technological change.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that the momentum in domestic demand over the second half of 2017 had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger than expected three months earlier, reflecting upward revisions to household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption growth in previous quarters and stronger-than-expected growth in non-mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in the December quarter. Beyond that, the Bank's forecast for GDP growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed. Growth was expected to increase to a little above 3 per cent from late 2018,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by low interest rates and the upswing in the global economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank continued to forecast a gradual pick-up in inflation over the following couple of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears as spare capacity in the economy is absorbed and wages growth gradually picks up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted, however, that spare capacity in the labour market would remain for some time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHeadline CPI inflation was expected to be a little above 2 per cent in both 2018 and 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderlying inflation was also expected to increase from close to 2 per cent currently to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove 2 per cent by the end of the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members were briefed on developments in the South Australian economy. They noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in South Australia had improved over the preceding year, in line with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnational trend. Growth had been broadly based across consumption, business investment and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic demand. Employment growth over recent years had been concentrated in household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tservices, as it had been in the rest of Australia. Wine and wheat exports are important\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributors to the South Australian economy, with fruit, vegetables and meat also becoming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasingly important exports from the state. Members discussed the effect of the closure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the car-building industry in South Australia, noting that, in net terms, manufacturing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployment had been relatively steady over recent years. Members recognised that the car\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplant closures had nevertheless been disruptive and difficult for many individuals and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of international economic conditions by noting that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the global economy overall had remained positive. Economic forecasters had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually upgraded their outlook for the global economy over the preceding year. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal GDP growth was expected to ease a little over the following couple of years, growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas still expected to be at or above trend in most of Australia's trading partners. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshould add to inflationary pressures over time, particularly in the major advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. The outlook for the global economy was little changed from the Bank's previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe global economic expansion of recent years had absorbed spare capacity, particularly in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe major advanced economies, where unemployment rates had moved below estimates of full\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployment and wages growth had picked up modestly.

Members noted that GDP growth in east Asia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(excluding China and Japan) looked to have picked up in early 2018. This was particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe case in the high-income economies, where growth in consumption and investment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthened. Together with a range of other indicators, this suggested that the softer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic data for this region in late 2017 had been temporary.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, economic growth had eased a little around the turn of the year, but had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfairly steady in year-ended terms at around 7 per cent. Members noted that growth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaterially stronger in nominal terms, at 11 per cent over the year, which was helpful in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontext of high levels of debt in the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers had a detailed discussion of the deepening economic linkages between the Chinese and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian economies. They noted that bilateral trade had broadened in scope over the prior\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecade to encompass a wider range of goods and services. Although exports to China are still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweighted towards bulk commodities, Australian exports of tourism and education services had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased notably in recent years. Members noted the strong global competition to supply the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese market and that Australia does not have the same natural comparative advantage in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother exports as it has in some resources. Direct investment in Australia from China had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso increased over the preceding 15 years, driven initially by investment in mining and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenergy, and more recently by a shift towards real estate, transport and infrastructure.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, direct investment from China remains a small share of the total outstanding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstock of foreign investment in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members were also briefed on developments in the Chinese financial system. The evolution of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe financial system since the late 1970s had played a key role in facilitating industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand urban development in China. Members noted that, over the preceding decade, the role of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit in the Chinese economy had become more expansive, reflecting new forms of lending and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing activity and spurred on by regulatory arbitrage (particularly on the part of small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks). While credit growth had helped to sustain strong rates of economic growth, financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstability risks had also risen. In their discussion, members focused on the growing size,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterconnectedness and opacity of the Chinese financial system. They noted that targeted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicies recently implemented had been aimed at preventing a further rise in financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstability risks while minimising the impact on GDP growth. However, it was acknowledged that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable uncertainty remains over the nature of the adjustment that could follow the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecade-long credit boom in China. Members also discussed how the authorities might act to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thelp reconfigure the financial system over the longer term to better support future drivers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof growth in the Chinese economy. Key concerns of the Chinese authorities in this regard were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevelling the playing field for small and medium corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowers, expanding the provision of retirement services and continuing with a measured\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpace of capital account reform.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal financial conditions had been little changed in April and, overall, remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative for households and businesses. This followed a modest tightening in financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in recent months, including an increase in the federal funds rate by the Federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve at its March meeting. In addition to this, the cost to banks and corporations of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing US dollars over short terms had risen and credit spreads on corporate bonds were a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle wider than the narrow levels reached earlier in 2018. Members noted that market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipants had suggested the tightness in short-term funding markets reflected increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUS Treasury bill issuance in the context of a higher US budget deficit as well as the effect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof recent US tax measures. There was uncertainty about how long and to what extent these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures in money markets would persist; some aspects were likely to be temporary, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tothers reflected structural changes in these markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that long-term government bond yields in the advanced economies, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia, had increased somewhat in April. The rise was particularly pronounced in 10-year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yields in the United States, which had moved above 3 per cent for the first time in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover four years. This reflected greater compensation for inflation risk amid recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in oil and some other commodity prices, as well as a rise in real yields.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment bond yields in the euro area had increased to a lesser extent than in other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, consistent with generally weaker-than-expected economic outcomes in the region,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing stronger economic outcomes in 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Central bank policy settings in the major advanced economies were unchanged since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious meeting. In China, the People's Bank of China had lowered the reserve requirement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tratio. Members noted that this would tend to increase liquidity and had been associated with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta general decline in interest rates, which would help to offset the increased cost of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfinance associated with measures aimed at restricting the availability of credit provided by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-bank entities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Global equity markets had been mixed over the preceding month, with changing sentiment around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinternational trade policy developments contributing to higher volatility in share prices in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe United States and China. Australian equity prices had increased slightly, underpinned by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trises in resources and energy stocks following higher commodity prices; share prices of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian financial institutions had fallen by around 7 per cent since the end of 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVolatility in foreign exchange markets remained at low levels. The Australian dollar had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen little changed on a trade-weighted basis over the preceding month, but had depreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby around 5 per cent since the end of 2017 in an environment of lower bulk commodity prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand a declining yield differential between Australia and the United States. The Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar exchange rate had remained in a narrow range over the preceding two years or so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelative to the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed developments in money markets in some detail, noting that increases in US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar borrowing rates (above changes arising from US monetary policy) had influenced money\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket rates for a number of other currencies, with Australian markets particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taffected. This link reflects the fact that Australian banks raise funds in US dollar markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto help fund their Australian dollar assets. Members noted that persistently higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing costs in short-term money markets would increase the overall cost of funds for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trange of financial institutions and some corporate borrowers. Rates on wholesale deposits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toffered by banks had also increased accordingly. Members noted that, more recently, money\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket spreads had declined a little from the levels reached around the end of the March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, corporate bond spreads, including for financial institutions, had risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly over the preceding month, closely in line with developments in international\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, but remained at relatively low levels. The overall funding composition of banks had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen quite stable for a number of years. Members noted the staff assessment that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taggregate cost of both short- and long-term debt funding had risen since February. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toverall effect on bank funding costs had been less than the rise in the cost of wholesale\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt funding since February, in part because there had been little change in interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor retail deposits, which account for around one-third of total bank funding.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rise in funding costs was expected to flow through to a slight increase in lending rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor larger businesses. However, to date, the average variable housing lending rate on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutstanding stock of loans had declined since late 2017. Growth in housing credit had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstabilised in 2018 following declines in the growth rates of lending to both owner-occupiers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand investors in 2017. Members noted that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(APRA) had been conducting a targeted review of lenders’ assessments of reasonable household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpenditures in loan applications as part of efforts to improve lending standards, and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlending standards might be tightened further in the context of the current high level of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic scrutiny of banks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPricing in money markets implied that the cash rate is expected to remain unchanged for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable period, with a 25 basis point increase expected in mid 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the flow of economic data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover the preceding month, for both the global economy and Australia, had pointed to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinuation of the broad trends over the preceding year or so. Conditions in the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy had remained positive and there had been further signs of a gradual strengthening in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Australian economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe global economic environment was expected to remain favourable over the next couple of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears, with most of Australia's major trading partners generally expected to grow at or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove their trend growth rates. Inflation had remained low but had increased a little in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome economies and further increases were expected, given the already tight labour markets,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in the major advanced economies. Against this backdrop, a number of central\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks had withdrawn some monetary stimulus and further moves in this direction were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected. The Chinese economy had continued to grow solidly, with the authorities paying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased attention to the risks in the financial sector and the sustainability of growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow the Chinese authorities navigate these various challenges would be important for growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia and the rest of the world. Developments in US–China trade relations would also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe important for the outlook for the global economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLong-term bond yields in the advanced economies and, more recently, credit spreads had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trisen, but remained low and financial conditions generally remained accommodative. Higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts of borrowing in US dollar short-term money markets had flowed through to higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshort-term interest rates in some other countries, including Australia. Equity market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatility had increased from the very low levels of 2017, in part reflecting concerns over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe direction of international trade policy in the United States. The Australian dollar had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained in its narrow range of the preceding couple of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, inflation had remained low. The recent inflation data were in line with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBank's expectations, with both CPI and underlying inflation running marginally below 2 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcent. Business conditions had remained positive and non-mining business investment had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing strongly. There had been increasing indications of emerging capacity constraints,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talthough this had not yet translated into a material pick-up in wages growth. The strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin employment had supported solid growth in consumption and this momentum looked to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued into 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing market conditions had eased a little further in Sydney and Melbourne, and had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed elsewhere. Tighter credit standards and APRA's supervisory measures had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thelpful in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets. However, household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt levels remained high, which members noted continued to pose an element of uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the outlook for consumption growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe low level of interest rates, along with the global economic upswing, had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunderpin growth in the Australian economy, with progress having been made over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear in reducing unemployment and having inflation return towards the target range. Further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprogress on these goals was expected over coming years. However, this progress was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be gradual. The Bank's central forecast for the economy to grow by a little above 3 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcent from late 2018 was expected to be enough to bring about a modest decline in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate over that period. As demand strengthens, so too should wages growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation, with underlying inflation expected to move higher later in the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increase in wages growth and inflation was expected to be gradual because spare capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the economy was expected to be reduced only slowly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there were risks to the forecasts in both directions. Among these, an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappreciation of the Australian dollar would be expected to result in a slower pick-up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic activity and inflation than otherwise. Members also noted that a further tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin lending standards in Australia, particularly in the context of the current high level of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic scrutiny of banks, was possible, which would affect household borrowing and spending.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the other direction, it was possible that global inflation could turn out to be higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan expected. Domestically, there were uncertainties around the extent and speed of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in wages growth and inflation that might occur as the unemployment rate declined.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the current circumstances, members agreed that it was more likely that the next move in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate would be up, rather than down. As progress in lowering unemployment and having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation return to the midpoint of the target range was expected to be gradual, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso agreed that there was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRather, members assessed that while this progress was unfolding, it would be appropriate to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thold the cash rate steady and for the Reserve Bank to be a source of stability and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking into account the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tachieving the inflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Based on indicators for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter received to date, GDP growth was expected to have picked up to be at least 2¾ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year because export volumes were expected to have recovered after weakness in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter. Growth was also expected to have been supported by consumption, public demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand business investment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Early indicators for the June quarter suggested that surveyed business conditions had remained at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir highest levels since the start of the global financial crisis a decade earlier, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption had been less buoyant. Growth in retail sales had been moderate in April; reports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the Bank's liaison program suggested that unseasonably warm weather had partly explained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively subdued outcomes for sales of clothing in particular and at department stores more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Preliminary data suggested that dwelling investment had picked up in the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInformation from the Bank's liaison program suggested that demand for detached houses had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained strong, while off-the-plan apartment sales had slowed considerably as a result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker investor and foreign demand. Capacity constraints appeared to have limited the pace of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork in higher-density construction, particularly in Sydney. The amount of building work in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpipeline remained high, and had increased recently in Victoria; the pipeline of work was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to support a high level of dwelling investment for some time yet.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Conditions in the established housing market appeared to have eased further in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne. Housing prices had fallen a little in both cities, particularly for more expensive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwellings. Members observed that falls in housing prices in Melbourne had been concentrated in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinner-city areas, whereas the declines in Sydney had been more widespread. Members noted that,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnonetheless, housing prices were still 40 per cent higher in Sydney and Melbourne than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the beginning of 2014, while housing prices in Perth had fallen by around 10 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the same period. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne had fallen to their lowest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels in a number of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Public demand was expected to have grown significantly faster than expenditure in other parts of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy in the March quarter. Both public consumption and public investment, which includes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in infrastructure projects, were expected to have contributed. The Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment budget, tabled in May, had announced $25 billion in infrastructure spending,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough some of this was conditional on state government funding and was expected to commence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome years later; in general, both federal and state government budgets suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure investment was likely to continue to support growth for some time. Stronger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic conditions had resulted in the Australian Government's underlying cash deficit for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018/19 being smaller than earlier projections.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The March quarter capital expenditure (Capex) survey suggested that non-mining business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had continued to grow; investment in machinery &amp; equipment had been stronger than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected in the March quarter, while non-residential construction activity had declined.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-residential construction activity was expected to ease further in 2018/19, based on data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the Capex survey and the decline in non-residential building approvals in the first few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths of 2018. Members observed that the Capex survey did not suggest a further pick-up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmachinery &amp; equipment investment, but they noted that the survey does not provide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation on intangible investments or investment in some parts of the services sector,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding education and health. Members also noted that profits in the non-mining sector as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of output had been resilient, which was positive for future investment. Mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas still expected to fall over the subsequent few quarters, as construction of the remaining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects reached completion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that labour market conditions had eased a little in recent months. Looking through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe monthly volatility in the labour force data, members observed that employment growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowed from a very fast pace in 2017 to something closer to the rate of growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworking-age population. However, forward-looking indicators of labour demand had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint to employment growth increasing to above-average rates in coming months. The unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate had been broadly steady at around 5½ per cent since mid 2017, suggesting that spare\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity remained in the labour market. The ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworkers had remained well below levels seen a decade earlier, which also signalled spare\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity in the labour market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Wages had continued to grow at a low and stable rate. The wage price index had increased by 2.1 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the year to the March quarter. Wages growth had remained faster in the household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices industries, particularly in healthcare and education (where a majority of employees are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaid under collective wage agreements), than in other sectors. The Fair Work Commission had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tawarded a 3.5 per cent increase in the minimum wage and higher-classification award wages,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich would boost wage outcomes in the September quarter. More broadly, members noted that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been some evidence of increased wage pressures in some areas of the economy. An increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of firms in the Bank's liaison program had reported that they expected wages growth to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick up and liaison contacts had continued to report pockets of wage pressures in construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand IT roles for which there had been skill shortages. In addition, a larger number of firms had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treported greater difficulty in hiring workers with the requisite skills.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that export volumes were estimated to have increased strongly in the March quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly unwinding the fall following supply disruptions in the December quarter. LNG production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to contribute to growth over the following year or so before levelling out at a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level. Exports of some other resources used extensively in renewable energy generation and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattery storage, such as copper and lithium, were expected to contribute to growth over this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, but to a much smaller extent than had iron ore, coal and LNG in recent years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Concerns about the durability of Chinese steel demand had eased and demand for Australia's bulk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodities was expected to remain strong in the near term. This had contributed to a recovery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin coking coal prices; by contrast, iron ore prices had been little changed over the prior\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth. Overall, bulk commodity prices had increased a little since the previous meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSustained strength in bulk commodity prices had contributed to a rise in the growth of mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector profits and the terms of trade in the March quarter. Oil prices had increased earlier in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMay to their highest level since 2014, but had fallen back in the period leading up to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members discussed a range of longer-term demographic developments. They noted that Australia had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperienced strong population growth over the preceding decade or so, in large part driven by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnet overseas migration of younger people. The composition of net overseas migration had affected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe age structure of the population. As a result, Australia's median age and old-age dependency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratios were projected to increase by less than those of other advanced economies, despite a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively high life expectancy. This would make Australia one of the youngest populations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithin this group of countries. Demographic trends varied by state. For much of the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecade, population growth had been particularly strong in Victoria and less so, though still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively high, in New South Wales, and the median age had declined in these states. The mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment boom had had a noticeable influence on demographic patterns in Western Australia and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tQueensland over the 2000s.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members observed that the increase in Australia's population and the changes to its demographic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristics had led to significant changes in labour supply and demand for housing. Over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprior decade, females in most age groups and males aged over 55 years had increased their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipation in the labour force by enough to offset the effects of the ageing of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation. Members noted that changes in policy settings and societal attitudes were likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave played an important role in these participation decisions. Differences in demographic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments helped to explain some of the differences in housing investment cycles across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstates. Members observed that continuing investment in infrastructure was required to service\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia's larger population.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members noted that global economic conditions had remained solid. While growth appeared to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teased a little in the major advanced economies early in the year, more recently growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthened in China and global activity indicators, such as growth in industrial production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand survey measures, had remained consistent with an ongoing expansion. In the advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, there had been further evidence of tightening capacity constraints, which were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to translate into higher inflation over time. Inflation in the emerging economies had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained relatively low. The prospect of additional tariff measures being introduced, either by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US administration or in response to its actions, continued to present a downside risk to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal economic outlook. Increased political uncertainty in Italy and concerns about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic prospects of some emerging markets, notably Argentina, Brazil and Turkey, had led to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased volatility in some financial market prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In China, recent indicators suggested economic conditions had strengthened modestly in April.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in industrial production had picked up and steel production had increased, supported by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh margins as well as ongoing demand for steel from the construction sector. Activity in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing sector had been resilient, partly because growth in housing demand had remained strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin cities where tightening measures were not in place. However, growth in infrastructure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had slowed, which partly reflected tighter funding conditions for local governments.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in bank lending had remained steady, while the provision of alternative sources of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancing had continued to contract in the face of tighter regulation and stronger enforcement.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Growth in India had picked up to be close to 8 per cent in year-ended terms. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat government efforts to support investment had contributed to this strength. India's ability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto boost its business service exports over recent years was also viewed as an indicator of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrighter prospects for future growth. GDP growth in Korea had picked up in the March quarter as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta result of stronger domestic demand. Members observed that many economies in east Asia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding Taiwan and Korea, had benefited from the pick-up in demand for electronics in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears and the resulting increase in trade through global supply chains.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Inflation had generally remained low in the Asia-Pacific region. It had picked up in India to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the Reserve Bank of India's 4 per cent target, but had eased further in New Zealand,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly reflecting low imported inflation and subdued wage pressures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In the major advanced economies, GDP growth had eased in the March quarter, after strengthening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent years, but had still been strong enough to continue to absorb spare capacity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnemployment rates in the United States, Japan and Germany had fallen to their lowest levels in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral decades and the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rise in many advanced economies. Although wages growth had picked up in all the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies, it had increased by less than historical experience would imply, given the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\textent of labour market tightness. Core inflation had remained low in Japan and the euro area,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut had increased to be close to target in the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Some slowing in US economic growth had been expected because the boost to consumption and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in the December quarter from the post-hurricane recovery had passed. Surveys and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market indicators nonetheless had confirmed that the underlying momentum in the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy had remained strong ahead of the sizeable fiscal stimulus that was scheduled for 2018\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 2019. The US labour market had continued to tighten and reports that it was difficult to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfind people to hire had become widespread. Members noted that evidence of wage pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding in the United States had become clearer over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The easing of growth in the March quarter in Japan and the euro area had partly reflected bad\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweather and other temporary factors. In Japan, consumption and investment growth were expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be supported by strong business conditions, the tight labour market, accommodative monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy and the global economic upswing. In the euro area, however, surveys suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness conditions had eased somewhat, and that this had continued into the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that political uncertainty in Italy could also weigh on confidence in the euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarea. Members observed that real GDP per capita in Italy was lower than before the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial crisis and that the Italian unemployment rate had declined only marginally after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnearly doubling following the onset of the crisis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal financial conditions had remained expansionary, political risk in the euro area and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstability in some emerging markets had come into greater focus. International trade policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in the United States had also remained a concern for market participants.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Political uncertainty in Italy had been accompanied by a significant increase in Italian bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields and a decline in the price of Italian bank stocks. Members noted that the bulk of Italian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment debt is held domestically and that Italian banks hold a substantial amount of Italian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment debt relative to their assets. The longer-term fiscal and economic challenges facing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly were discussed. Members noted that measures of sovereign risk, as reflected in the yield\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspread of Italian over German bonds, had remained well below levels recorded in the 2011–12\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tepisode of instability in the euro area. There had been limited signs of spillovers to other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro area sovereign markets. It was also noted that a change of government in Spain had not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerated disruptive effects in financial markets there.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members observed that long-term government bond yields for a number of major sovereign issuers,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding Australia, had declined in May. In the euro area, the fall in German yields had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected, in part, the effect of safe-haven flows and an easing in growth momentum in the euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarea. In the United States, 10-year bond yields had traded in a wide range before finishing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly lower for the month, reflecting a modest reduction in expectations for policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightening by the Federal Reserve.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that central bank policy settings in the major advanced economies had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunchanged since the previous meeting. The US Federal Reserve had continued gradually to reduce\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe size of its balance sheet, in accordance with its earlier announced plans, while the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEuropean Central Bank and Bank of Japan had maintained asset purchases consistent with their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighly accommodative policy settings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that conditions in US dollar short-term money markets had eased since early April,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough they remained tighter than in 2017. A similar profile had been evident in Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney markets, although interest rate spreads had begun to pick up again in recent days. It was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso noted that corporate bond spreads in the advanced economies had remained low. Movements in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal equity markets had been mixed over the preceding month. While US equity prices had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by strong corporate earnings, Chinese markets had been little changed and European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had been weighed down by declines in equity prices of financial institutions. Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequity prices had been largely unchanged over May; increases in resource stocks had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderpinned by higher commodity prices, while the equity prices of Australian financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions had declined.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members also discussed developments in emerging markets, noting that problems in a few countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad largely reflected idiosyncratic weaknesses and that spillovers to Asia had been limited to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdate. In particular, large current account and budget deficits, high inflation and political\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty in Argentina and Turkey had contributed to substantial exchange rate depreciations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand widening bond spreads over US Treasuries in those countries. Central banks had intervened in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeign exchange markets in an effort to stem further depreciation and they had raised their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy interest rates. Argentina had also sought financial support from the International\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMonetary Fund. In Brazil, authorities had intervened to slow the depreciation of the real in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontext of heightened political and fiscal uncertainty and high levels of debt. The Mexican peso\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad depreciated in response to developments in Argentina and Brazil, as well as uncertainty over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe future of Mexico's trading relationship with the United States and the upcoming presidential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>By contrast, financial markets in the Asian region had been generally resilient. Bank Indonesia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad raised policy rates twice in the second half of May and intervened in the foreign exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand bond markets in order to dampen volatility; the rupiah had depreciated only modestly over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe course of 2018. Despite considerable uncertainty over international trade developments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese financial asset prices, including the renminbi exchange rate, had been relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstable, and authorities had continued to take measures to reduce risks in the financial system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The Australian dollar had been little changed over the prior month and thus had remained in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trange seen over the preceding two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that housing loan approvals had eased in recent months, driven by approvals to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors, although approvals for owner-occupiers had also declined. This was consistent with an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing in the demand for credit as well as lenders tightening their lending standards. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that banks had recently started to collect more information from loan applicants on living\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpenses to assess a borrower's capacity to service a loan based on actual living expenses,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than relying on a proxy measure of minimum expenses based on survey benchmarks. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that, while there may be some further tightening of lending standards affecting housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth in the period ahead, any such tightening was expected to be modest. At the same\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, lenders had been competing for high-quality borrowers, which had led to a decline of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 15 basis points in the average mortgage interest rate on outstanding loans since August 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSlightly higher funding costs for banks appeared to have had little effect on mortgage rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Pricing in money markets implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable period, with a 25 basis point increase not expected before the second half of 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that conditions in the global economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad strengthened over the prior year. Output in China had grown solidly, which had supported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand for Australia's resource exports and commodity prices. At the same time, Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities had continued to implement policies to manage risks in the financial sector and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tensure the sustainability of future growth. Growth in the major advanced economies had eased a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle in the first quarter of 2018, but underlying momentum in these economies had still been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with above-trend growth. Wage pressures were increasing, particularly in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates and Japan, where labour market conditions were very tight by historical standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Growth in global output was expected to continue to absorb spare capacity, leading to a lift in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation. As a result, a number of central banks had withdrawn some monetary stimulus and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther steps in this direction were expected. Conditions in US dollar short-term money markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere tighter than they had been a year earlier. Although these higher rates had flowed through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto higher short-term interest rates in a few other economies, including Australia, overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial conditions globally remained expansionary. Members noted that the direction of trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy in the United States continued to be uncertain. In addition, concerns about political\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in Italy and developments in some emerging market economies had affected some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial prices. The Australian dollar had been relatively unaffected by these developments and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained within the range it had been in for the preceding two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that recent data had been consistent with the Bank's central forecast for GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth to pick up to be above 3 per cent by the end of 2018. Business conditions were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositive and non-mining business investment was expected to increase. Public spending, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton infrastructure, and exports were also expected to support growth. While consumption was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to grow at a broadly stable rate in the near term, the outlook for consumption growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to be a source of uncertainty, given that household income growth had been slow and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt levels remained high.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Employment had grown strongly over the previous year, but the unemployment rate had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged because strong labour demand had been met by people entering the labour force or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelaying retirement. Although employment growth had slowed over recent months, forward-looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators suggested employment would continue to grow faster than the working-age population\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the period ahead and that, as a result, there would be a gradual decline in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate. Although wages growth had remained low, members noted that there had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore evidence that employers were having difficulty hiring workers with the requisite skills and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat wage pressures were building in some parts of the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Inflation remained low and was likely to remain so for some time, reflecting slow growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour costs and strong competition in the retail sector. However, a gradual pick-up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation to be above 2 per cent was still expected as the economy strengthens and wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth increases. An appreciation of the exchange rate would be expected to result in a slower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in economic activity and inflation than currently forecast.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Conditions had continued to ease in established housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne and had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained subdued in most other capital cities.

An easing in the demand for credit as well the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority's supervisory measures and tighter credit standards\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been helpful in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets, although the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of household debt remained high. While there might be some further tightening of lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards in the period ahead, the average mortgage interest rate on outstanding loans had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined over the previous year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The low level of interest rates was continuing to support the Australian economy.

Measures of growth in average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thourly wages had also increased. Nonetheless, wages growth remained low, consistent with ongoing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspare capacity in the labour market and some structural forces that had also been evident in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother economies. Growth in other sources of household income, including income from government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance, investments and rent, had continued to be weak, as over the prior couple of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the housing market, members noted that data from the national accounts suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelling investment had peaked in late 2016, although residential construction cycles had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiffered significantly across the states. In New South Wales, dwelling investment in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher-density projects had remained at a high level since the beginning of 2016. Liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontacts had suggested there were capacity constraints in Sydney, which meant that, given the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge amount of work in the pipeline in New South Wales, construction activity was likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain at a high level for some time. Dwelling investment in Victoria was also likely to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a high level for some time. Members noted that more of this activity had been in detached\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwellings and that ‘greenfield’ land sites had generally been more readily available in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVictoria. By contrast, the construction cycle for apartments had clearly passed its peak in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tQueensland, while detached housing construction in Western Australia might have reached a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrough.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn established housing markets, housing prices had declined in Sydney and Melbourne following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant increases in previous years. Housing prices had fallen by almost 5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney over the preceding year. Members observed that prices in Sydney and Melbourne had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen the most for more expensive properties, while prices of lower-priced properties had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed, consistent with the typical pattern of larger fluctuations in prices at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher end of the market. In the other state capitals, housing prices had been fairly steady,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the exception of Hobart, where prices had picked up markedly given strong demand and supply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstraints.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the labour market, employment growth had moderated from the very strong rates recorded in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2017 and the participation rate had declined a little from its recent peak. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost of the jobs created over the preceding year had been in the private sector. Much of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength in employment growth over recent years had been in the health and social assistance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry, where about three-quarters of people work in the private sector. In recent quarters,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment had expanded in a broader range of industries, including construction, manufacturing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand professional, scientific and technical services. The unemployment rate had ticked down to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5.4 per cent in May and had remained in a narrow range around 5½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the preceding year. This suggested that there continued to be excess capacity in the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket, as did indicators such as the underutilisation rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that some indicators of demand for labour were at high levels. The Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBureau of Statistics measure of job vacancies had reached its highest level as a share of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour force since the late 1970s, when the series commenced, and measures of firms' hiring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions from business surveys had been strong. However, there had been less momentum in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleading indicators of labour demand based on job advertisements. Overall, leading indicators of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour demand pointed to above-average employment growth over the second half of 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsistent with this, members noted that wage pressures had been building in some parts of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy but had not yet become broadly based.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe public sector had continued to contribute noticeably to GDP growth in the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPublic investment had increased strongly over the year, supported by spending on transport\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure, and the pipeline of work to be done had increased. Public consumption had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrown, partly reflecting spending associated with implementation of the National Disability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInsurance Scheme. The consolidated budget balance for the federal and state governments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated slightly smaller cash deficits over the coming two years than had been expected six\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths previously.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivate non-mining business investment had increased in the March quarter, to be 10 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher over the year. Growth in machinery and equipment investment had picked up, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation from the Bank's liaison program had suggested that the current and prospective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength in public infrastructure investment had improved the investment outlook for many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate sector firms in the construction industry. Members noted that private infrastructure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment, including investment in telecommunications and renewable energy, had also increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter. Data on approvals in recent months suggested that construction of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential buildings was likely to make a smaller contribution to growth in non-mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness investment in future. Mining investment had declined further in the March quarter, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction work at some liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects neared completion. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in machinery and equipment in the mining sector had increased, following a period of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost-cutting that had led to deferral of some investment. Recent survey measures of business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had continued to be at levels well above average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExport volumes had increased strongly in the March quarter. Coal export volumes had rebounded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing resolution of earlier supply disruptions and LNG exports had risen strongly as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects in Western Australia ramped up production. In April, volumes of LNG, iron ore and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthermal coal exports had increased, while the volume of coking coal exports had declined as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult of weather-related disruptions to supply.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia's terms of trade had risen by 3.3 per cent in the March quarter, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a little more than had been expected a few months earlier. The prices of coking and thermal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoal had increased since the previous meeting, supported by higher demand from Asia and various\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstraints on supply in some of the largest exporting economies. Iron ore prices had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed over the previous month and were within their range of the preceding few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that wool prices had increased significantly, but that wool represented quite a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall share of Australia's total exports. Base metals prices had declined over the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth in response to heightened trade tensions. Most other commodity prices had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged since the previous meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers held a detailed discussion of the high level of household debt in Australia, informed by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta special paper prepared for this meeting. Household debt has increased by more than household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome over the preceding three decades in many countries, but particularly so in Australia. Two\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkey drivers of this trend across countries have been the decline in nominal interest rates,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpredominantly reflecting lower inflation, and financial deregulation, both of which have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased households' access to finance. Members noted that a distinguishing feature of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian housing market is that the bulk of dwellings are owned by the household sector. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas contributed to greater borrowing for housing by households in Australia compared with other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries, where the corporate sector owns a larger proportion of rental properties. Another\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeature of the Australian housing market that has contributed to greater borrowing by households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis the higher cost of housing in Australia on account of a larger share of the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation living in urban centres, typically in large detached dwellings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey data indicate that much of Australian household debt is owed by higher-income and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddle-aged people, who tend to have more stable employment and often larger savings buffers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, members recognised that a material share of household debt is held by lower-income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds, which generally have higher debt relative to their income. Household assets in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taggregate are valued at around five times the value of household debt and total assets exceed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe value of debt for most households. Members noted, however, that most household assets are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing and superannuation, and that both of these are illiquid.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that high levels of household debt could affect economic outcomes. For example,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds with high debt levels are more vulnerable to economic shocks and therefore more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to reduce consumption in the face of uncertainty about their future income. Members also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that changes in interest rates have a larger effect on disposable income for households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith high debt levels, but that these households may be less inclined to borrow more at times\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen interest rates fall. Accordingly, members agreed that household balance sheets continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twarrant close and careful monitoring.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the global economy had generally remained positive. Surveyed business conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been above average and growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolid, although below the rates seen in 2017. Domestic demand had also remained quite strong in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost regions, supported by varying combinations of accommodative monetary policy and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasingly stimulatory fiscal policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome of the downside risks to the global growth outlook had increased over the prior month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdditional tariff measures had been confirmed in a number of economies in prior weeks and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprospect of further measures being introduced appeared to have become more likely. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat trade tensions extended beyond the United States and China, and could escalate through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-tariff measures such as administrative delays. An escalation of trade tensions could harm\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal growth by undermining confidence and delaying investment decisions and could dampen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinternational trade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, indicators of economic activity had been mixed in May. Growth in retail sales had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen sharply, while growth in some categories of industrial output had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthen. In particular, strong demand for steel had supported prices at high levels and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraged production. This, in turn, had underpinned demand for Australian exports of coal and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiron ore. Housing prices had been flat or falling in the largest Chinese cities, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestrictions on housing purchases have been most stringent, but had risen rapidly in smaller\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities. Investment in real estate had picked up but most of this had been land purchases rather\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan construction. Infrastructure investment had weakened, which was likely in part to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected ongoing efforts to reform local government finances. Members noted that infrastructure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment activity could recover in coming months, given that many local authorities still have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity to issue more bonds. Growth in total social financing had been steady in May and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese regulators had recently introduced additional measures to strengthen oversight of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanking sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn other east Asian economies, GDP growth had been robust in the March quarter. More recent data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested this pace was likely to have continued in the June quarter. While exports had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to contribute significantly to growth in the region, domestic demand factors had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecome increasingly important.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the major advanced economies, GDP growth had remained above trend rates. In the United States\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Japan, growth looked to have increased in the June quarter, following lower outcomes in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch quarter. In the euro area, however, some indicators of activity had softened further in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months, suggesting a weaker near-term outlook than in the other two major economies. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing had been broadly based across euro area member countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour markets had continued to tighten across all three major advanced economies. Employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been higher than growth in the working-age population for some time and unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates had fallen to be well below estimates consistent with full employment in some economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWages growth had picked up gradually in response. This had supported the outlook for consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in these economies and was expected to lead to rising inflationary pressures. Core\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation had been close to the Federal Reserve's target in the United States, where demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas likely to have been boosted by the effects of recent reductions in corporate and personal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome tax rates. Core inflation had remained below target in both Japan and the euro area,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough in the latter case higher oil prices had meant that CPI inflation was at the level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttargeted by the European Central Bank (ECB).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal financial conditions remained supportive of economic activity. However, financial market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipants remained focused on risks arising from international trade tensions, political\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in Europe and strains in some emerging market economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the major central banks were at different phases of their monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcycles. The Federal Reserve was most advanced in withdrawing monetary stimulus, consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe relative strength in economic activity and inflation in the US economy. By contrast, the ECB\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Bank of Japan had continued to ease policy through ongoing asset purchases, further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpanding their balance sheets. Moreover, both central banks had maintained negative policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had raised the federal funds rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby 25 basis points at its June meeting, as had been widely expected. The median of FOMC members'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojections for the federal funds rate had been revised upwards slightly since the March FOMC\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting, implying a faster increase over 2018. While the federal funds rate was projected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmove above FOMC members' estimates of its long-run neutral level by the end of 2019, sooner\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan in the previous projections, the median projection for the end of 2020 was unchanged at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround ½ percentage point above the long-run neutral level. Members noted that market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations for the federal funds rate remained below those of FOMC members.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank of Canada and Bank of England were also expected by market participants to take further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteps to withdraw some monetary stimulus in coming months, although if that came to pass their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy rates would remain accommodative. At its June meeting, the ECB Governing Council\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannounced its intention to wind down its net asset purchase program by the end of 2018, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould bring an end to the ECB's easing cycle, while maintaining the current level of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnegative policy rates at least through the (northern hemisphere) summer of 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the cash rate in Australia was higher than the policy rates of the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral banks, with the exception of the Federal Reserve, and that the Reserve Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbalance sheet had been little changed since the global financial crisis, compared with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant balance sheet expansions undertaken by some other central banks over that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLong-term government bond yields in a number of the major markets had declined slightly over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune, in part reflecting concerns about international trade policies. However, US long-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields remained higher than at the end of 2017, consistent with continued robust growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations of rising inflation and further removal of monetary stimulus in the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn European markets, sovereign yield spreads over German bonds had declined in Spain, Portugal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Italy, following an easing in earlier political tensions. While spreads in Spain and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPortugal had returned to levels observed in 2017, Italian spreads had remained elevated,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting ongoing market concerns about the expansionary fiscal plans of the new Italian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConcerns about rising international trade tensions had weighed on global equity prices, most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticeably in Asian markets. US equity prices had remained high, having risen substantially over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2017, reflecting continued strength in corporate profits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the US dollar had appreciated against a broad range of currencies over 2018\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the context of relatively strong US growth prospects and rising US interest rates as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFederal Reserve withdrew monetary stimulus. After appreciating in the earlier part of the year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Chinese renminbi had depreciated in June, reflecting the broad-based strength in the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar as well as international trade tensions and a moderation in economic growth. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar had depreciated over 2018, largely against the US dollar, but remained within\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe range it had traded in over the preceding couple of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProblems in a few emerging market economies had resulted in local financial market stresses,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in Argentina, Turkey and Brazil. Members noted that the International Monetary Fund\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad approved a larger-than-expected financial assistance package for Argentina. Stresses in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother emerging markets had generally been limited, although capital outflows had picked up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe recent period. Members noted that volatility in financial markets, both in emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies and more generally, had risen a little in prior months but remained close to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger-run averages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, authorities had continued to take measures to contain risks in the financial system\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand overall credit growth had eased further. Members noted, however, that the People's Bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof China had recently reduced banks' required reserve ratios to assist banks in making\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogress on debt-for-equity swaps or increasing lending to small and micro-sized enterprises.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to domestic financial conditions, members noted that Australian long-term bond yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad moved broadly in line with developments in global markets in recent months and remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow US long-term bond yields. Money market rates in Australia had also been moving broadly in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tline with those in international markets earlier in the year, but in the weeks preceding the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting had increased independently of other markets. Members observed that this was consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the recent pattern of rising funding pressures at the end of each calendar quarter, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that it was uncertain how persistent these pressures would be. As a result, funding costs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the major banks had risen a little over 2018, reflecting the higher bank bill swap rate over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis period, but had remained low relative to history. Banks' net bond issuance in 2018 had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing credit growth had continued to slow in May. The slowing in housing credit growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe prior year had been driven largely by slower growth in lending to investors, which had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined to the lowest rate since early 2016. Members discussed the important role that demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfactors had played in slowing the pace of borrowing. A softening in demand for housing credit in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe context of high household debt levels was consistent with the slowing growth, and in some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets outright falls, that had been seen in housing prices. Declines in advertised interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates for new borrowers by some banks had also suggested some softening in demand for credit.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted, however, that there had also been some tightening in supply of credit as a result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof tighter lending standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn recent months, the major banks had announced lower interest rates for some new loans,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding some loan products for investors and interest-only loans. Some smaller banks had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased their advertised standard variable mortgage rates over the previous month. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved that, while changes in advertised housing lending rates had not been in a particular\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirection overall, lending rates for new and outstanding variable housing loans had drifted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdownwards over much of the prior year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, although growth in Australian business debt had increased from a year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier, it remained moderate as businesses tend to rely on internal funding for investment. On\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan accumulation basis, Australian share prices had generally moved in line with international\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets over recent years but had outperformed other markets in June. Company profits were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally expected to continue growing, especially in the resources sector, which had benefited\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom higher commodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the global economic expansion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued. A number of advanced economies were growing at an above-trend rate and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperiencing increasingly tight labour market conditions. Growth in the Chinese economy appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have moderated a little, and there was some uncertainty around how the authorities there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould respond given the trade-offs involved in achieving the target for output growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanaging financial stability risks. Concerns about the direction of international trade policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States and its effect on the global outlook had intensified over the prior month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStrains had continued in a few emerging market economies, largely for country-specific reasons,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had affected some financial market pricing, although spillovers to other markets had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlimited. Concerns about political developments in several European countries had generally eased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the prior month, although concerns about political developments in Italy had remained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been further evidence of rising wage pressures in the major economies where labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket conditions had been tight. Strong global growth had also contributed to higher commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices in early 2018, which had increased upstream inflationary pressures and boosted Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of trade. However, core inflation had remained below most central banks' targets, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe exception of the United States, where it had increased to be around the Federal Reserve's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobally, financial conditions had remained expansionary, although they were gradually becoming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless so in some economies. Given current and prospective economic conditions, the Federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve was expected to increase the federal funds rate over 2018 and 2019; this had contributed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. Against this background, the Australian dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad depreciated a little, but remained within the range it had traded in over the previous two\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent data on the Australian economy had been consistent with the Bank's central\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast for GDP growth to pick up to be a bit above 3 per cent over 2018 and 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-mining business investment had contributed significantly to growth in the March quarter, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad public infrastructure investment, and business conditions had remained positive. The outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor consumption remained a source of uncertainty for the GDP forecasts, given that household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome had continued to grow slowly and debt levels were high.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe outlook for the labour market had remained positive. Forward-looking indicators of labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand continued to point to solid growth in employment; most notably, the vacancy rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisen to a historically high level. These conditions were expected to lead to a gradual decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the unemployment rate. Although wages growth was expected to remain low in the near term,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger labour market conditions and growing skills shortages were expected to lead to wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth picking up over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing prices had fallen moderately in Sydney and Melbourne, following significant growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding years, and had been little changed over the preceding six months in other cities on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage. Housing credit growth had declined, mainly because investor demand had slowed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticeably. Lending standards were tighter than they had been a few years previously and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority's supervisory measures were helping to contain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe build-up of risk in household balance sheets. Some further tightening of lending standards\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby banks was possible, although the average mortgage interest rate on outstanding loans had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclining for some time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe low level of interest rates was continuing to support the Australian economy. Inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained low, reflecting low growth in labour costs and strong competition in retailing. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to view the strengthening economy as likely to deliver further progress in reducing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rate and returning inflation to target. In these circumstances, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to agree that the next move in the cash rate would more likely be an increase than a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecrease. However, since progress towards a lower unemployment rate and an inflation rate closer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the midpoint of the target range was likely to be gradual, they also agreed there was no\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, the Board assessed that it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand confidence while this progress unfolds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy and achieving the inflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Indicators of global industrial production and trade had remained at relatively high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels, as had surveyed business conditions. Spare capacity had continued to be absorbed,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially in the major advanced economies. Headline inflation had moved a little higher since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning of the year, primarily as a result of higher oil prices. Core inflation had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased in a few economies, including the United States, but had remained low elsewhere.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank's forecast was for global growth to ease a little over the following few years, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto remain above trend. Members noted that, although this forecast was broadly unchanged from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree months earlier, the risks to the international economic outlook had shifted. Although the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirect effects of trade protectionism measures that had been implemented and further measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had been proposed were expected to be small, the broader risk of adverse effects on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment decisions and confidence had increased. On the other hand, members observed that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge fiscal stimulus in the United States was occurring in a period of little spare capacity in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US economy. It was therefore possible that US growth and inflation could be stronger than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected. This could prompt a faster withdrawal of monetary stimulus than markets expected and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlead to a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. This scenario implied stronger global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth than forecast and could be associated with a depreciation of the Australian dollar, both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof which would support the Australian economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe near-term outlook for growth had remained positive for the United States and Japan. In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune quarter, the US economy had received a boost from recent tax cuts and a pick-up in export\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, while growth in Japan was expected to have picked up, partly reversing the weak outcome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter. Both economies were expected to continue growing at an above-trend pace\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover 2018 and 2019; survey data had indicated that investment growth was expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong and labour market conditions were expected to support consumption growth. By contrast, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe euro area there had been signs that consumption growth and investment intentions had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderated a little since the beginning of 2018, although GDP growth was still expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove trend over the forecast period. Across the advanced economies, unemployment rates had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrended lower and surveys had suggested that more firms were facing labour shortages. Wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had picked up noticeably over the preceding few years, although it remained relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow compared with its historical levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, GDP growth had eased slightly relative to a year earlier and growth had been weaker\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan expected in a number of sectors, including infrastructure construction. Nonetheless, steel\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction and prices had been high, which had supported Australian exports of bulk commodities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese authorities had tightened some regulations to reduce the build-up of financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstability risks, but had also introduced targeted fiscal stimulus and eased monetary policy to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcounter slowing growth in some sectors of the economy. Elsewhere in east Asia, year-ended output\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been steady in the first half of 2018. Export growth had remained high and domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand had been increasingly contributing to growth. Members noted that many economies in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregion were vulnerable to an escalation in trade tensions, given their high trade exposures and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintegration with global supply chains.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by observing that the outlook had not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged materially over the preceding three months. Growth was forecast to strengthen to be a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbit above 3 per cent over 2018 and 2019, before easing to a little above trend towards\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe end of 2020 as the ramp-up in liquefied natural gas (LNG) production came to an end.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Non-mining business investment was expected to continue to grow over the forecast period, but at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta more moderate pace than over the previous year. While quite lumpy, non-residential building\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprovals had fallen in trend terms since their peak in mid 2017. However, members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was still a reasonable pipeline of building construction work, which should support growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the near term. Work yet to be done on private infrastructure investment had also increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in investment in machinery and equipment was forecast to pick up further, consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan ongoing economic expansion. Mining investment was still expected to trough in coming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarters, but beyond that was expected to increase moderately as companies invested to sustain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Public demand was expected to make a significant contribution to growth over the period to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of 2020, based on information provided in the state and federal budgets. Further expansion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the National Disability Insurance Scheme was expected to support public consumption, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure projects were expected to support public investment spending.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Drought conditions, particularly in New South Wales and southern Queensland, had affected the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttiming of crop harvests and had led to an increase in slaughter rates. This was expected to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributed to a rise in rural exports in the June quarter. Members noted that the probability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof an El Niño event, which would typically be associated with low rainfall in eastern\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia, had increased over 2018, implying downside risks to the forecasts for farm output and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports. Resource export volumes were expected to have been higher in the June quarter and to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontribute to growth over the subsequent year or so, as LNG production continued to ramp up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Commodity prices were little changed over the previous month. Trade tensions had contributed to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls in oil and base metals prices. Coking coal prices had fallen, partly as a result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian supply coming back on line, while prices of iron ore had risen and thermal coal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had remained at a high level. Many rural commodity prices had increased, partly because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrought conditions had restricted the supply of some rural commodities from Australia and other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries. Over the previous year, the terms of trade had held up at a higher level than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously forecast, largely reflecting higher thermal coal prices than had been expected. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of trade were expected to remain around their current level for a few quarters or so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore declining moderately over the medium term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In established housing markets, prices in Sydney and Melbourne had declined further in July and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross a broader range of properties. Housing prices had also declined in Perth, but had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased in Hobart and been relatively stable in Adelaide and Canberra. Rental vacancy rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been little changed in Sydney and Brisbane, and had continued to fall in Melbourne, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong population growth had continued to outpace additions to the rental stock. Rental\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvacancies had remained high in Perth, but were lower than the peak in the previous year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Despite the easing of conditions in the established housing market, dwelling investment was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to remain at a high level, but not to contribute to growth, over coming quarters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResidential building approvals had trended lower, which was consistent with information from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliaison contacts that there had been a decline in off-the-plan sales of apartments.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, a significant pipeline of work remained to be done, particularly in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne. Liaison contacts had continued to report that capacity constraints had been limiting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pace at which the pipeline could be worked through, particularly in Sydney.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Recent data on consumption showed that retail sales in the June quarter had been consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteady growth in consumption in year-ended terms. Liaison contacts had also reported that retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrading conditions had been stable. Overall growth in consumption in the June quarter was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to have been supported by growth in labour income. Growth in household disposable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome had picked up over the year to the March quarter, reflecting an increase in growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage earnings per hour and hours worked. Members noted that these increases, in combination\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the more recent increase in minimum wages, the announcement of future tax cuts and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations of a further tightening in labour market conditions, had reduced some of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty around the outlook for consumption.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Employment had increased by 51,000 in July, and employment growth had been a little above average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the first six months of 2018, although it had slowed from the very strong rate over 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unemployment rate had declined slightly in recent months, but had remained around 5½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince mid 2017. Leading indicators suggested that employment could be expected to grow at an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove-average pace in the second half of 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that the unemployment rate forecast profile was unchanged from three months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier. With the extension of the forecast period to the end of 2020, the unemployment rate was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to reach around 5 per cent by the end of the forecast period. Based on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistorical relationships, members noted that the level of vacancies was consistent with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast for a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the second half of 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, there continued to be uncertainty about the extent of spare capacity in the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket and how quickly this would translate into higher wage and price inflation over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast period. It was possible that ongoing above-trend growth in output could see the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate fall faster than expected and wages growth pick up more strongly as a result.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlternatively, it was possible that the flow of new entrants to the labour force could be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger than usual, such that unemployment would decline more slowly than expected and wage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures would take longer to emerge.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Headline and underlying inflation had both been around ½ per cent in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, in line with earlier forecasts. In year-ended terms, headline inflation had picked up a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle to 2.1 per cent, while underlying inflation had remained close to 2 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStrong competitive pressures and low growth in wage costs had been placing downward pressure on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail prices for some time. In an environment of falling wholesale prices and heightened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition in the retail energy sector, energy providers had reduced some retail prices in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune quarter and there had also been an unusually small increase in private health insurance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpremiums. Rents, which are a large item in the CPI basket, had been flat in the June quarter and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended rent inflation had been at its lowest rate since the mid 1990s. By contrast,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation in new dwelling costs had risen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that inflation in the September quarter was likely to be lower than previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast because of new government measures, including changes to childcare subsidies and TAFE\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand car registration fees, as well as some recent reductions in utilities prices. The forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofile for inflation had otherwise been unchanged. Taking these effects into account, headline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand underlying inflation were expected to be around 1¾ per cent over 2018, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen increase to around 2¼ per cent in 2020, in line with previous forecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there was some risk that the recent decline in wholesale electricity prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould have more persistent effects on utilities prices than had been factored into the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts. At the same time, members noted that these price declines would boost real household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisposable income.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members were briefed on developments in Australian dollar short-term money markets. Interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates in these markets had been rising sharply towards the end of recent quarters, and only part\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the rise had subsequently been unwound following the end of each quarter. As a result, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of interest rates in these markets had been higher than in 2017, despite market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations for the path of the cash rate having changed little over this period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members discussed a range of factors that may help to explain these outcomes, noting that it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to be definitive about the cause. Around the end of the March quarter, the rise and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfall of Australian dollar money market rates had been associated with a similar pattern for US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar money market spreads, but in the June quarter the movements had been specific to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia. Members noted that banks had become less inclined to supply liquidity to money\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets in light of regulatory developments, although this development had also been experienced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin money markets in other countries. As a result, interest rates appeared to have become more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponsive to changes in demand and supply than had been the case previously. In particular,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tportfolio reallocation had lowered demand for bank bills issued by major Australian banks, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad contributed to the increase in the bank bill swap rate. In foreign exchange swap markets,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere structural changes in liquidity conditions had also been apparent, interest rates had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased as a result of stronger demand for Australian dollars, partly reflecting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconversion back to Australian dollars of increased offshore bond issuance by Australian banks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Notwithstanding these developments, domestic funding conditions had remained generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative. Members noted that funding costs for the major banks had risen a little in 2018\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a result of the increase in short-term money market rates, but had remained low relative to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistory, consistent with the low level of the cash rate. In particular, the higher money market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates had to date not been reflected in significant changes in retail deposit rates. Banks'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnet bond issuance had remained strong in 2018 and bond spreads had remained low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that the average interest rate on outstanding variable-rate housing loans had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined by around 10 basis points since August 2017. Some smaller lenders had increased their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandard variable interest rates more recently, although other lenders had reduced interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates on some mortgage products.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Housing credit growth had continued to ease over the first half of 2018, driven by a decline in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth for investors. Members noted that this appeared to have been mainly due to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoftening demand from investors in an environment of declining housing prices in some markets,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough it was likely that there had also been some reduction in the supply of credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociated with tighter lending standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Turning to developments in global financial markets, members noted that global financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions continued to support economic growth. Monetary policy in the major economies remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative, although central banks were at different stages of their monetary policy cycles.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In the United States, the Federal Reserve had continued to indicate that further gradual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in the federal funds rate were likely over the next couple of years. Market pricing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplied that the next policy rate increase was expected in September, but, beyond that, market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations for the federal funds rate remained below those implied by the median projection of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe members of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Bank of Canada and Bank of England had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth raised their policy interest rates at their most recent meetings, as had been widely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected. Market pricing implied that the Bank of Canada would increase policy rates further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the coming year. The European Central Bank had indicated that negative policy rates were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to remain in place until the latter half of 2019 and that it planned to end its net asset\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurchases by the end of 2018. At its July meeting, the Bank of Japan introduced forward guidance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the effect that its stimulatory policy settings will remain in place for an extended period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn an effort to help improve market functioning, the Bank of Japan had also announced a slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twider trading range for 10-year government bond yields to meet its target of around 0 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that government bond yields in the major markets had risen moderately over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding month, but had generally remained low. In the United States, markets had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfocus on the flattening of the US Treasury yield curve. Members noted that this flattening had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen driven largely by rising short-end rates (consistent with increases in the federal funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate) and a decline in the term premium for bonds, rather than by expectations for slower growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor lower inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Equity prices had risen further in the advanced economies over the preceding month, supported by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong corporate earnings. US share prices had outperformed other markets over recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing particularly strong corporate earnings in the United States, share buybacks and merger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand acquisition activity. Australian share prices, when compared on the basis of accumulation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindices (which take account of dividend payments), had also outperformed other markets over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months. By contrast, in China, equity prices had fallen sharply over recent months in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponse to slowing growth and rising international trade tensions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Major advanced economy exchange rates had generally been stable since the previous meeting. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad followed a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar over the course of 2018. The Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenminbi had depreciated since May, in part reflecting the general appreciation of the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar, but international trade tensions, moderating growth and a targeted easing in monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy by the People's Bank of China were also likely to have contributed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Conditions in some emerging financial markets had stabilised somewhat since the previous meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEarlier localised financial market stresses relating to country-specific concerns had eased in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome markets in July, although concerns had remained in some others. Overall, most emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had experienced capital outflows and a depreciation of their exchange rates relative to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US dollar in 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The Australian dollar had been little changed against the US dollar since the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting, but had appreciated slightly on a trade-weighted basis, reflecting the recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation in the renminbi. The Australian dollar had remained within its trading range of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members concluded their review of developments in financial markets with a discussion of access\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto finance for small businesses. Members reviewed the issues raised by participants at the Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSmall Business Finance Advisory Panel and two special roundtable events involving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepresentatives from small business, lenders and the public sector. They noted that many small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses looking to expand still found it challenging to access finance, particularly without\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproviding real estate as security. Lenders had highlighted that they were keen to lend to small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses, and that the higher cost of unsecured finance mainly owed to the associated risk.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there had been more funding available from private equity sources recently,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut that the supply of venture capital remained small compared with some other markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members discussed some initiatives suggested by market participants that could potentially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timprove access to finance for small businesses. Members were encouraged by the potential for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomprehensive credit reporting and open banking to lower the cost of credit risk assessment for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlenders. They also noted efforts to improve the financial capability of small businesses by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencouraging better financial record-keeping. They observed that the reliance on real estate as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollateral in small business lending could be reduced by making it easier to use other assets as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurity, such as machinery and equipment. Finally, members noted private sector initiatives in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother jurisdictions designed to provide more equity funding for small businesses seeking to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the global economic expansion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued. This had contributed to higher commodity prices in 2018, which had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupstream inflationary pressures globally and boosted Australia's terms of trade. A number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies were growing at above-trend rates and were experiencing increasingly tight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market conditions. There had been further evidence of rising wage pressures in these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. Although core inflation had remained below most central banks' targets, it had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased to be around the US Federal Reserve's target. Growth in the Chinese economy had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowed a little and the authorities had eased fiscal and monetary policy in a targeted way to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport near-term growth, while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. The direction of international trade policy in the United States continued to be a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsource of uncertainty for the global outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Against this backdrop, global financial conditions had remained expansionary, although they were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually becoming less so in some economies, most notably the United States where the Federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve was expected to increase the federal funds rate further over 2018 and 2019. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributed to a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. Although the Australian dollar had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciated a little against the US dollar, in trade-weighted terms it had remained within\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits trading range of the previous two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The forecasts for the Australian economy were largely unchanged. GDP growth was expected to be a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle above 3 per cent over 2018 and 2019, supported by strong public demand,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresource exports, further growth in non-mining business investment and steady consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. Business conditions remained positive, while recent data on wages growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations of a further tightening in labour market conditions had provided more comfort that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold income growth would continue to increase gradually and support the outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption. Members were cognisant of the effect of drought conditions on the rural sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, including vacancy rates, continued to point to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove-average growth in employment in the near term. The unemployment rate was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline gradually towards 5 per cent. Wages growth was expected to increase gradually\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas spare capacity in the labour market is absorbed over the forecast period. Year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation had been close to 2 per cent in the June quarter, which was in line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious forecasts. Although inflation was expected to be temporarily lower in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, owing to falls in some administered prices, inflation was still expected to be around 2¼ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2020.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Housing prices had fallen moderately in Sydney and Melbourne, following significant growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding years, while housing prices had been relatively stable in most other capital cities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRent inflation had remained low. Housing credit growth had declined, mainly because investor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand had slowed noticeably. Lending standards were tighter than they had been a few years\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously, partly reflecting the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupervisory measures to help contain the build-up of risk in household balance sheets. Some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther tightening of lending standards by banks was possible, although competition for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowers of high credit quality remained strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Based on the forecasts, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to support economic growth and allow further progress to be made in reducing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. In these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate would more likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe an increase than a decrease. However, since progress on unemployment and inflation was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be gradual, they also agreed there was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy. Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress unfolds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tachieving the inflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.</p>"]}},

Monetary policy settings had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to be accommodative in most economies, although a few central banks had become less\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative as spare capacity was absorbed and inflationary pressures had become more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in global industrial production had been robust, particularly in the United States, euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarea and smaller east Asian economies (that is, excluding Japan and China). Growth in global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerchandise trade had eased to around its decade average. Growth in euro area exports,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly to China, had declined since mid 2017, while export growth had remained strong in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmaller east Asian economies. More generally, members observed that there were still significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttensions around global trade policy and that this represented a material risk to the outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States and China had increased bilateral tariffs further in late August, consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith earlier announcements. On the other hand, the US and Mexican governments were close to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinalising a new trade agreement.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the advanced economies, spare capacity had continued to be absorbed. In the United States,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strong growth recorded in the June quarter seemed likely to have continued into the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter, supported by fiscal stimulus. Survey measures had pointed to further robust\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in investment. In the euro area, GDP growth had eased in most countries over the first\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf of 2018, but had remained above trend growth. The Japanese economy had expanded in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, following the small weather-related contraction in GDP in the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumption growth had picked up and continued to be supported by relatively strong growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour income. Tight labour market conditions had also been encouraging Japanese firms to invest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin labour-saving technology. GDP growth had remained above trend in smaller east Asian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies; although business investment growth had slowed in a few economies, consumption growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the region overall had remained strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour markets had continued to tighten in most advanced economies. In the United States, Canada\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Sweden, wages growth had been increasing gradually and this had led to a gradual increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcore inflation. In the United Kingdom, the depreciation of the pound had also contributed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly to inflationary pressures. However, core inflation had remained subdued in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro area and Japan despite above-trend growth. In contrast, in India inflation had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target; in response, monetary policy had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightened in both June and July.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, growth in economic activity had slowed in a number of sectors. Growth in retail sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been declining and infrastructure investment had been particularly weak. Domestic production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof consumer-oriented goods, including white goods and textiles, had declined over time, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers noting that some production had been moved from China to other economies. In contrast,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction of steel and glass, which are used extensively in construction, had increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese authorities had responded to the slowing in growth with targeted fiscal stimulus,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding the announcement of new rail infrastructure projects and directives to hasten progress\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton some current infrastructure projects. Growth in total social financing had also increased in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months, consistent with the authorities' encouragement of bank lending to certain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors. Demand for housing had remained strong; property sales had increased and there had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta broad-based pick-up in growth in housing prices. The authorities in some cities had responded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby strengthening regulatory measures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe strength in Chinese crude steel production had supported imports of high-quality iron ore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand coking coal. In turn, this had supported benchmark steel and iron ore prices, which had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained in a relatively tight range since the end of March, although the premiums for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher-quality iron ore had increased. Members discussed the variation in iron ore prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting different iron content and different physical characteristics including impurity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels. They noted that proposed replacement mines in Western Australia were expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontribute to a higher average quality of iron ore product, which would also support prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived for Australian iron ore.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMovements in commodity prices had been mixed since the previous meeting. Benchmark iron ore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had declined a little after the Chinese authorities announced a new round of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironmental restrictions. Coking coal prices had increased over the prior month, but had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined from high levels since the start of the year. Thermal coal prices had remained at a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level, supported by strong demand from Asian economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers began their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that conditions in Western\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia had improved after the decline resulting from the resource investment cycle.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey-based reports of business conditions in Western Australia, which had previously been well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow those reported for the rest of the country, had increased to be above historical averages,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough still below the rest of Australia. Average hourly earnings in Western Australia were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill around 10 per cent higher than average hourly earnings in the rest of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry, although the differential had narrowed in recent years. Population growth in Western\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia remained well below the national average, after earlier very rapid growth. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that there continued to be net migration from Western Australia to other parts of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry. Conditions in Western Australian housing markets had been weak: dwelling investment and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals were stabilising at low levels, while housing prices and rents had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fall.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the national accounts for the June quarter would be released the day after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe meeting. Growth was expected to be above estimates of potential growth in year-ended terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that data released since the previously published forecasts suggested there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould be upward revisions to the recent history of GDP growth, which would boost measured\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in household consumption was expected to have recovered in the June quarter; retail sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolumes pointed to a solid increase in consumption of goods. Retail sales data for July had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively weak, although online sales had continued to grow rapidly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment was expected to have increased in the June quarter. Work done on both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdetached and higher-density dwellings had picked up, driven by increases in New South Wales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(despite reports of capacity constraints) and Victoria; residential construction work done on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew dwellings had continued to drift slightly lower in Western Australia and Queensland.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough residential building approvals had declined from their peak of a few years earlier, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpipeline of work to be done had remained around historically high levels in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne. Some sources of demand for new housing had eased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat. Notably, information from liaison with developers had indicated that off-the-plan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales of new apartments in the major east-coast cities had declined over the preceding year as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult of weaker demand from domestic investors and foreign buyers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEstablished housing market conditions overall had continued to ease. Housing prices had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalling gradually in Sydney and Melbourne, and in recent months price declines had become more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twidespread across different suburbs and price segments. Although housing prices in Perth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso declined over recent months, prices in other capital cities had been little changed. Rent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation had remained low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivate business investment looked to have declined a little in the June quarter, based on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartial indicators. Non-mining investment intentions for 2018/19 reported in the ABS Capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExpenditure survey had been revised higher, although firms still expected capital expenditure to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe lower than in 2017/18. Mining investment was still expected to trough in late 2018 or early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2019, as the remaining large liquefied natural gas projects are completed. Business conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore generally had remained well above average, according to a range of surveys, despite easing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly since earlier in 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExport volumes had increased strongly in the June quarter, led by rural exports. Drought\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in some parts of Australia were expected to result in lower overall rural production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand exports in the period following the June quarter, although members noted that a record crop\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected in Western Australia. The increased probability of an El Niño event suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe prospects for rain in drought-affected areas had fallen in the near term, which was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto increase the magnitude of any fall in output from the farm sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the Australian labour market had continued to improve. Consistent with above-trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in the economy, the unemployment rate had edged slightly lower over 2018, to be 5.3 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was the lowest rate since late 2012. Members observed that there had been a notable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in youth unemployment rates in recent months. The level of employment had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged in July; growth in full-time employment had been offset by a decline in part-time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment. Leading indicators had suggested that employment growth would be slightly above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage in the period ahead. In particular, job vacancies had increased to be at a record high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a share of the labour force. Members noted that labour market conditions had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvary across the country. Employment growth had been strong in New South Wales and Victoria and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rates in these states were around 5 per cent. The share of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation in employment had continued to be highest in Western Australia, despite the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate in that state increasing to around 6 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWages growth had picked up slightly in the June quarter, with a quarterly increase of 0.6 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the wage price index. In year-ended terms, wages growth had edged higher since late 2016 and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis pick-up had been quite broadly based across industries, with the notable exception of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail sector. Information from liaison had continued to point to a modest increase in private\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector wages growth in coming quarters. Members noted that the effects of the recent increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe minimum wage would boost wage outcomes in the September quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers began their discussion of developments in financial markets by observing that broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative financial conditions had continued to underpin economic growth globally, and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe low volatility in financial markets in advanced economies contrasted with ongoing financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfragility in a number of emerging market economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was expected to increase the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfederal funds rate by another 25 basis points in September as the Federal Reserve continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually to withdraw monetary stimulus. Although financial conditions in the United States had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightened a little over the prior year, they remained expansionary overall. Market pricing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to suggest a slower expected pace of policy rate increases than the median projection\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof FOMC officials. Members noted that in recent years, actual policy changes had been more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclosely aligned with the FOMC's median projections than with market expectations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank of England had increased its policy rate in August but was not expected to increase it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain for at least another year, while the Bank of Canada had increased its policy rate in July\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand further increases were expected before the end of 2018. In Japan and the euro area, monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy was expected to remain highly stimulatory for some time. In both Australia and New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tZealand, where official interest rates had not declined to the same extent as in other advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, adjustments to the stance of monetary policy were also seen by markets as likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe some way off.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that over the prior month, bond yields had declined slightly in most major markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in Australia, and had remained at generally low levels for both sovereign and corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuers. However, Japanese bond yields had increased slightly in response to the announcement by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Bank of Japan of a wider trading range for 10-year government bond yields. In Italy, ongoing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns about the future stance of fiscal policy following the change in government in May had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresulted in wider spreads of Italian debt over German Bunds. However, the extent of the widening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin spreads had been smaller than had occurred during the European debt crisis earlier in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecade, and spillovers to other markets had been relatively muted. Members noted that the budget\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplans of the coalition government in Italy, due to be tabled before parliament in late\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember, would be likely to be an important focus of financial market participants.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStrength in earnings had continued to underpin corporate debt and equity markets in the advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, notably the United States, where the boost to economic activity, sales and profits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the recent tax cuts had contributed to generally positive earnings results. Share buybacks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States also had been boosted by recent tax reforms, which encouraged the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepatriation of offshore earnings by multinational enterprises. Australian equity prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen little changed over the preceding month, but accumulation indices (which take account of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdividend payments) had continued to increase and the profit reporting period had been relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositive. Members noted that the sharp decline in Chinese equity prices since the start of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear had occurred in an environment of weaker-than-expected indicators of growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplementation of measures to contain financial risks, as well as rising trade tensions with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had been little changed against the other major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrencies over the preceding month, having appreciated by around 5 per cent on a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade-weighted basis since the start of the year. Along with other currencies, the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar had depreciated against the US dollar, and on a trade-weighted basis, but remained within\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe relatively narrow range of the preceding few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed developments in emerging markets, where capital outflows had continued over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe previous month and exchange rates had depreciated, particularly in a few countries that had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant economic, financial and institutional vulnerabilities. In some markets, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities had responded to exchange rate depreciation by intervening directly in the foreign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange market and/or by raising policy rates. In Turkey, rising political tensions with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States, high inflation and the lack of credible policy responses had contributed to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother sharp depreciation of the lira over the preceding month, which was around 40 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower against the US dollar over the year. In Argentina, the peso had also depreciated sharply.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Argentine authorities had been in discussions with the International Monetary Fund to revise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe terms of the current financial assistance package, with the potential to bring forward the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisbursement of funds to support the exchange rate and shore up the government's financing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneeds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to financial market developments in Australia, members noted that interest rates on bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbills and other money market instruments had remained at a higher level compared with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage level of 2017, and that this had placed some upward pressure on banks' funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts. Higher money market rates had led to a modest increase in overall funding costs, taking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of all sources of funding, including retail deposits, on which rates had remained low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand been drifting down of late. Nonetheless, funding costs remained low relative to history,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the low level of the cash rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy the time of the September meeting, lenders accounting for around 40 per cent of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutstanding housing credit (including one major bank) had announced increases in mortgage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending rates in response to the increase in funding costs. Once they take effect, these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases would imply a small rise in the average outstanding variable housing loan rate,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunwinding about half of the decline observed in the average housing loan rate over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear. Members noted that there was evidence that banks had continued to compete strongly for new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowers for housing, including by increasing discounts on published lending rates. For\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers, housing credit had been growing relatively strongly at around 7½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannualised over the preceding six months, whereas growth in lending to investors had slowed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticeably.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the global economic expansion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued at a solid pace. Although growth in the Chinese economy had slowed a little, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities had eased fiscal and monetary policy in a targeted way to support near-term growth,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector. Global commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had generally remained elevated, which had supported Australia's terms of trade in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first half of 2018, but ongoing uncertainty about trade policy had led to volatility in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices of some commodities. More generally, the direction of international trade policy in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States continued to be a source of uncertainty for the outlook for the world economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost advanced economies were growing at above-trend rates and were experiencing increasingly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttight labour market conditions as well as rising wage pressures. Although core inflation had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained subdued in the euro area and Japan, it had picked up to around central bank targets in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe United States and a number of smaller advanced economies. Against this backdrop, a few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral banks, including the Federal Reserve, were expected to continue gradually reducing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdegree of monetary policy accommodation. This had been reflected in financial market pricing,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost notably a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. This appreciation had raised risks for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome economies, particularly the more fragile emerging market economies, but the modest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the Australian dollar was helpful for domestic economic growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data had suggested that domestic growth had been above potential over the year to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune quarter, supported by strong public demand, resource exports, non-mining business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment and steady consumption growth. Business conditions remained positive and recent data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton labour market outcomes had been positive. The unemployment rate had declined to 5.3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin July, which was its lowest rate since the peak of the mining investment boom in 2012.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForward-looking indicators of labour demand, including vacancy rates and survey measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment intentions, continued to point to above-average growth in employment in the near\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm. The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually towards 5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWages growth was expected to increase gradually as spare capacity in the labour market is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsorbed. More generally, recent data had not changed members' assessment that GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas likely to remain above potential throughout the forecast period and inflation was likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease over time. However, members recognised that there continued to be risks associated with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainties from abroad and low wages growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNational housing prices had fallen moderately. In Sydney and Melbourne, price declines had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed significant growth over preceding years. Housing credit growth overall had declined,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainly because investor demand had slowed noticeably. Lending standards were tighter than they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a few years previously, partly reflecting APRA's earlier supervisory measures to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelp contain the build-up of risk in household balance sheets. Some further tightening of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending standards by banks was possible, although competition for borrowers of high credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquality remained strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBased on the forecasts and associated risks, members assessed that the current stance of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy would continue to support economic growth and allow for further progress to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget. In these circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould more likely be an increase than a decrease.

Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunfolds. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy and achieving the inflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Members noted that developments in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade policies continued to pose significant risks to this outlook. While the United States had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcluded trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico, additional tariff measures had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplemented by the United States and China in the weeks leading up to the meeting. To date, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttariffs imposed on US imports of Chinese products had affected capital goods and industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinputs proportionately more than consumer goods.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, GDP growth had remained strong in the first half of 2018 and, more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently, industrial production growth and surveyed conditions in the manufacturing sector had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen robust. The strength in economic activity had partly reflected the fiscal stimulus, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad more than offset any effect of higher tariffs. GDP growth had remained above trend in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro area and Japan. Growth in output in Japan had been supported by strong growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment, which was expected to continue. However, growth in industrial production in Asia had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teased, as had growth in exports and new export orders; exports from the euro area to China had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso eased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbove-trend growth in the major advanced economies had led to further absorption of spare\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity in their labour markets. As a result, wages growth had increased noticeably. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved that minimum wages had been increasing faster than average wages across a number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. Most notably, in South Korea minimum wages had increased by more than 15 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2018 and a further increase of 10 per cent was scheduled for 2019. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat increases in minimum wages of this magnitude could affect employment decisions, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmaller increases, such as the recent increase in Australia, were unlikely to have a material\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on growth in employment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHigher wages growth had contributed to a pick-up in core inflation in a number of advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. Core inflation in the United States had picked up to be around the Federal Reserve's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation goal. However, core inflation in the euro area and Japan remained subdued. Higher oil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices were expected to contribute to an increase in headline inflation in a number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, data received over the previous month had been mixed and continued to suggest that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic activity had remained subdued in some sectors, most notably infrastructure investment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast, manufacturing and real estate investment had edged higher. There were indications\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat real estate investment might pick up further: housing demand had remained strong; housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had increased, particularly in cities where housing policies were less restrictive; and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction of construction-related products had been relatively strong. To some extent, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook for infrastructure investment depended on government policy and local governments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinuing to obtain funding through bond issuance. Overall, total social financing in China had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased a little over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumer price inflation in China had picked up, mainly because of higher oil and food prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile core inflation had remained relatively subdued. Members noted that food and energy make up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta relatively large share of Chinese households' consumption and that recent disease- and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweather-related supply problems are likely to result in further increases in food prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prices of iron ore and coking coal had increased since the previous meeting, partly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting strong demand by Chinese steel producers and reports that the upcoming winter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestrictions on Chinese steel production might not be as strict as in the previous year. Supply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisruptions had also contributed to a recent increase in coking coal prices. Base metals prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been little changed and remained well below levels of a few months earlier. Oil prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisen to levels last seen in 2014, partly as a result of lower-than-expected supply.

Real\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP had increased by 0.9 per cent in the quarter, and upward revisions to growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier quarters had taken GDP growth over the year to the June quarter to 3.4 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was the strongest year-ended rate of growth since 2012. More recent data had pointed to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther solid growth in GDP in the September quarter, although growth was expected to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderated a little from the strong rates recorded over the first half of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousehold consumption growth had picked up in the June quarter and had remained elevated over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe preceding year in the face of the weak income growth reported in the national accounts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that uncertainty about how consumption would respond if there were an extended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod of low income growth, and/or declining housing prices, remained an important\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsideration for the forecasts. More recently, retail sales values had been flat in July and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation from liaison with retailers had continued to point to below-average growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnominal retail spending.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment had increased in the June quarter and over the year. The increase had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcentrated in New South Wales and Victoria, where capacity constraints in the construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry were apparent. Looking forward, members noted that the decline in residential building\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprovals since mid 2016 suggested dwelling investment was likely to be close to its peak in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent cycle. Nonetheless, the large pipeline of work yet to be done was expected to support a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level of dwelling investment in the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the established housing market, overall conditions had continued to ease gradually. Housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had fallen a little further in Sydney and Melbourne in recent months and price declines\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad become more widespread in both cities. Housing prices had also declined further in Perth,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut had been little changed in other mainland capital cities. Rental vacancy rates had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the preceding couple of years in all capital cities except Sydney, although the vacancy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate remained high in Perth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPublic sector spending had continued to grow relatively strongly, with both public consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand investment having contributed to GDP growth over the year to the June quarter. Recent data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton work yet to be done on infrastructure projects had suggested public investment would remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh over the following couple of years. The final federal budget outcome for 2017/18 revealed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the deficit had been smaller than expected, owing to higher revenue and lower-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMining investment had risen strongly in the June quarter, partly reflecting higher expenditure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton machinery and equipment as well as a sharp increase in exploration activity. Non-mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had declined somewhat in the June quarter, but had increased strongly over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding year. Overall conditions in the business sector had remained positive. Survey measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof business conditions had remained well above average, despite easing a little since the start\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the year. Profits had risen strongly over the preceding year, particularly in the mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, where commodity prices had been higher than previously expected and production had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisen. There had been a broad-based increase in export volumes in the June quarter, led by rural\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports. This had been driven partly by higher meat exports, as drought conditions and rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeed costs for livestock had encouraged higher meat production. Members noted that economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had remained challenging in drought-affected parts of the country. Farm production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to decline in 2018/19 because drought conditions in some key farming regions were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to reduce crop yields.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that employment had risen strongly in August, driven by full-time employment, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth had been stronger than population growth over the year. Employment growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe preceding year had been strong in business services, while employment in the health and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsocial assistance industry had been relatively stable, having increased strongly in earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. Employment in the manufacturing sector had picked up recently. The participation rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen little changed at a high level in 2018. Having been around 5½ per cent for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe preceding year, the unemployment rate had declined a little to 5.3 per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJuly and August. Members noted that spare capacity in the labour market had declined over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths; youth unemployment rates (that is, for people aged between 15 and 24 years) had fallen,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas had the rate for people who had been unemployed for up to a year.

Taken together with other leading indicators of labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand, such as surveys of firms' employment intentions, this continued to suggest that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth would exceed population growth in coming months, which was expected to result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin further gradual absorption of spare capacity in the labour market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite ongoing improvements in labour market conditions, the national accounts measure of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage earnings growth had been weak in the June quarter and had increased by only 2 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the June quarter. Other components of household income, including government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransfers, had also recorded below-average growth in the recent period. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in unit labour costs, which adjust hourly earnings for productivity growth, had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued for a number of years, averaging less than 1 per cent in year-ended terms and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad led to downward pressure on underlying inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that financial conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies remained accommodative, although they were gradually becoming less so in some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. By contrast, financial conditions had generally tightened in emerging markets in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018, with a few economies having economic, financial or political vulnerabilities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted the divergence in monetary policy paths among the major central banks, consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith differences in spare capacity and the inflation outlook across economies. In the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates and Canada, policy accommodation was being removed, with further gradual increases in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy rates widely expected in the coming year. The Federal Reserve had increased the federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds rate by 25 basis points in September, as anticipated; both the median projection of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members and market pricing suggested a further increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember. The median FOMC projection remained for the federal funds rate to increase to a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the median FOMC estimate of the neutral level over the subsequent two years. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial market pricing implied a somewhat higher path for the federal funds rate than was the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase a month earlier, this path was still below that implied by the median FOMC projection.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome gradual removal of monetary stimulus was also expected in the United Kingdom, Norway and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSweden, although policy rates in these economies remained very low. Members observed that market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpricing implied that policy rates were expected to be steady over the coming year in Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand New Zealand, where rates had not reached the very low levels observed in some other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. In Japan, the euro area and Switzerland, maintenance of very stimulatory policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsettings, including negative policy rates, was expected for some time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment bond yields had edged higher in most advanced economies over the previous month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmostly reflecting higher real yields. This was consistent with increased market expectations for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther increases in the US federal funds rate. Nevertheless, government bond yields generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained low by historical standards, with inflation expectations contained and term premia at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunusually low levels. Other indicators also pointed to continued accommodative financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in most advanced economies, with credit spreads, equity risk premia and equity market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatility having generally remained low. One notable exception was Italy, where market concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the future stance of fiscal policy had resulted in the yield spread of Italian debt over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGerman Bunds increasing sharply following the release of the Italian government's draft\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbudget.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted the ongoing financial fragility in Turkey, Argentina and, to a lesser extent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrazil. There had been substantial exchange rate depreciations and increases in government bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyield spreads in these economies since early 2018. Recently, financial conditions in these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies had stabilised somewhat, although they warranted monitoring, including to the extent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a tightening in financial conditions might spill over more indiscriminately to other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerging markets. In Turkey and Argentina, the central banks had increased policy rates sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto stem concerns about further exchange rate depreciation given the economies' exposure to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeign currency-denominated debt. The Argentine authorities had reached a provisional agreement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the International Monetary Fund to revise the terms of the financial assistance package\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreed earlier in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the authorities had implemented fiscal and monetary easing measures in the context of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderating growth.

This had occurred in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe context of US long-term bond yields having moved above those in Australia over this period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand notwithstanding some rise in commodity prices more recently. On a trade-weighted basis, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the Australian dollar had been more modest, and the trade-weighted index was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted as being in the lower part of the range that had prevailed over the preceding few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInterest rates on bank bills and other money market instruments had remained above their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverages of 2017, but the pattern of temporary sharp rises in these rates towards the end of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent quarters had not been repeated at the end of September. Banks' net bond issuance had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained strong in 2018. Non-financial corporate bond issuance had also been robust in the first\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf of 2018, although it had been more subdued in the September quarter. At the same time,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, corporate bond spreads had remained low and growth in business credit had picked up a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that there had been a modest increase in banks' overall funding costs over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first half of 2018, reflecting the higher cost of debt funding as a result of the increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin money market interest rates; the cost of funding sourced from retail deposits had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery low over 2018 and had even declined a little recently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost of the major banks and many other lenders had announced increases in housing lending rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin response to the higher funding costs. This was likely to unwind the decline observed in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage outstanding variable housing lending rate over the preceding year. Growth in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit had continued to ease, driven largely by investors, while growth in lending to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers had remained relatively strong at 7 per cent in six-month-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannualised terms. Members noted that, on average, interest rates offered on new housing loans\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained below interest rates on outstanding loans for owner-occupiers, and even more so for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors, indicating that banks were continuing to compete for new borrowers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVariable interest rates on outstanding loans to large businesses, many of which are directly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlinked to bank bill swap rates, had increased in line with the increase in bank bill rates over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018, although they remained very low. The average interest rate on outstanding variable-rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloans to small businesses had been little changed over the preceding year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian share prices, even when compared on the basis of accumulation indices (which take\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of dividend payments), had underperformed relative to major global markets in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding month. Movements in equity prices in Australia had been mixed across different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors. Share prices of financial corporations had declined, with share prices for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinsurance sector having declined over the previous month following developments in the Royal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry.

Banks' improved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofitability had enabled them to boost their capital. However, some banks in Europe still had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow levels of capital. Banks' asset performance had also improved in most advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. The share of non-performing loans had fallen and in many economies had returned to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpre-crisis levels. However, in some economies the share of non-performing loans remained high.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRegulatory reforms implemented following the financial crisis had resulted in an increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks' capital ratios, which had significantly improved the resilience of the banking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that low government bond yields, while having risen somewhat in the United States\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent months, were underpinning the high valuation of many assets. This implied that any\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharp increases in long-term interest rates could precipitate significant price falls across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroad asset classes. The compensation investors required for bearing risk also remained at low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast to advanced economies, in China non-financial corporate debt, relative to GDP, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased substantially since the financial crisis to a level that was high by international\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards. This was a significant financial stability concern. Growth in debt had slowed in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious couple of years, but the earlier rapid growth in lending had raised concerns about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquality of that lending. The Chinese authorities were continuing to address financial stability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks and these efforts were yielding noticeable results. Specifically, there had been a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpronounced slowing in credit provided through non-bank financial institutions and the extent of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir linkages with banks was stabilising.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning their discussion to financial conditions in Australia, members discussed the effect of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tightening of loan serviceability standards implemented over recent years in response to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks in housing lending. They noted that most borrowers took out a loan that was substantially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmaller than the maximum loan that lenders were prepared to offer; three-quarters of borrowers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad taken out loans that were less than 80 per cent of their maximum borrowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity based on serviceability considerations. This suggested that relatively few borrowers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould have been constrained by the tightening in lending standards that had reduced maximum loan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsizes to date.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe two quantitative policy measures that had been implemented in previous years – namely, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestor and interest-only benchmarks – were judged to have been effective in reducing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspecific risks they targeted. The rate of growth in lending to investors had declined and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained well below 10 per cent per annum, and the share of interest-only loans in new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing lending had fallen from around 40 per cent to 15 per cent. The share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof interest-only loans in the stock of outstanding loans had also declined, in large part\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause lenders had increased interest rates on existing interest-only loans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed quantitative analysis undertaken by Reserve Bank staff, which showed that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestor benchmark imposed in 2014 had led to a change in the composition of new lending for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing. In particular, the investor benchmark had resulted in lending to investors growing more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowly but lending to owner-occupiers growing more quickly, with no discernible change in new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing lending in aggregate at the time. Additional analysis indicated that over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfew years, the investor benchmark had resulted in slower growth of housing prices in locations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a high share of investors, relative to locations with a low share of investors. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslower growth in housing prices had not been the objective of the policy measures, members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the analysis suggested around two-thirds of the difference in growth in housing prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween these regions in recent years could be attributed to the prudential measures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYields on Australian commercial property had declined over recent years, although spreads to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields were within the range historically observed. Members noted there was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong foreign demand for commercial property, with some foreign investors willing to accept\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower yields and hence pay higher prices than domestic investors. Office vacancy rates in Sydney\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Melbourne generally were low, which was promoting construction activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian banks' ratio of non-performing housing loans had edged up further over the first\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf of 2018. The ratio was around the same level observed following the financial crisis, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained low both in absolute terms and relative to other countries. The vast majority of banks'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-performing loans remained well secured. Much of the increase in non-performing loans had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccurred in Western Australia, where economic conditions had been weak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian banks' capital ratios had also increased substantially after the onset of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial crisis. The major banks were close to or already meeting ‘unquestionably strong’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital levels and other banks were above their regulatory minimums. Members noted that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn on equity for the major banks in Australia remained high relative to that in other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries. In the United States and Japan, return on equity for large banks had settled at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 8–10 per cent, considerably lower than that prevailing before the financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrisis, while the Australian major banks continued to achieve rates of return on equity well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove this level.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the release of the interim report of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The report contains many questions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcovering a broad range of issues, but at this stage provides relatively little indication of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecommendations that are likely to be made in the final report. Members observed that while the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregulators had already overseen a tightening of lending standards, and a degree of tightening of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending standards had been implemented by banks in anticipation of the Commission's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfindings, it was possible that banks could tighten lending conditions further given the issues\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\traised in the report. Members noted that it would be important to monitor the future supply of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit to ensure that economic activity continued to be appropriately supported.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that global economic conditions had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to be positive for the Australian economy, although the global economic outlook was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject to a range of risks. Most notably, developments in international trade policy continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be a source of uncertainty. However, energy and bulk commodity prices had generally remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\televated, which had supported Australia's terms of trade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that most advanced economies had continued to grow at above-trend rates and labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had continued to tighten. This had led to a noticeable increase in wage pressures. Core\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation had picked up in the United States and a number of smaller advanced economies, but had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained subdued in the euro area and Japan. Headline inflation had been boosted by higher oil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices. Although some sectors of the Chinese economy had slowed, the authorities had eased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal and monetary policy in a targeted way to support near-term growth, while continuing to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpay close attention to financial risks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAgainst the background of rising global inflationary pressures, a few central banks, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Federal Reserve, had increased their policy rates in recent months, and the degree of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy accommodation was expected gradually to be reduced. Changes in the expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaths of monetary policy had been reflected in changes to financial market pricing, most notably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta broad-based appreciation of the US dollar. This appreciation had raised risks for some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, particularly the more fragile emerging market economies, but the resultant modest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the Australian dollar was likely to have been helpful for domestic economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data on economic activity in the Australian economy had been generally positive and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the forecast for GDP growth to be above potential over the following two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth had been well above potential growth over the year to the June quarter, supported by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong public demand, resource exports, non-mining business investment and steady consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. Employment growth had increased, the participation rate had remained high and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate was trending lower.

However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecorded household income growth had been subdued and this continued to be an important source\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof uncertainty for the outlook for consumption and inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing prices had declined noticeably in Sydney and Melbourne, following significant growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover preceding years, but had been little changed in most other cities. Housing credit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined, largely as a result of a sizeable slowing in demand from investors. Some lenders\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased their standard variable housing lending rates by small amounts in response to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher money market interest rates, although housing lending rates had been reduced for some new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloans. More generally, lending standards had become tighter than they had been a few years\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously, partly reflecting the introduction of supervisory measures to help contain the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuild-up of risk in household balance sheets.

In these circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas more likely to be an increase than a decrease. However, since progress on unemployment and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation was likely to be gradual, they also agreed there was no strong case for a near-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunfolds. Therefore, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Growth was expected to ease a little over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubsequent two years, but to remain above potential in 2019. Although there had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange to the Bank's outlook for trading partner growth over recent months, the latest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts had incorporated a small negative effect from recent tariff changes on growth in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of economies, including the United States and some east Asian economies. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the risks to the global outlook from a further escalation in trade tensions and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered the implications for the Australian economy of a scenario in which wages and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation in the United States pick up by more than expected, given the strength of the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in the major advanced economies had remained above potential in 2018. Growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States had been strong, supported by the sizeable fiscal stimulus. While US manufacturers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad raised concerns about the effects of rising input costs and their competitiveness, business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment intentions had remained strong. Unemployment rates had declined further in the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies and wages growth had picked up. In the United States, the increase in wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been boosted by workers changing jobs, but recently workers had also been receiving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher wage increases without changing employers. Members observed that inflation in the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies had increased as a result of higher oil prices and wages growth. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcore inflation had remained low and little changed in some advanced economies, notably Japan and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe euro area, but was close to target in others, including the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in China had moderated a little further in the September quarter, following the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightening of financial conditions in late 2017 and early 2018. Although activity in the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices sector had been resilient, conditions had remained weak in the industrial sector and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic investment had declined. In response, the Chinese authorities had implemented targeted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary and fiscal policies to support growth, while maintaining their commitment to containing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks in the financial system. The adverse effect on the Chinese economy from higher tariffs was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to have been partly offset by policy measures that had been introduced to support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffected trading firms. The depreciation of the renminbi over 2018 had also provided support to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy overall. Elsewhere in Asia, indicators suggested that growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teased a little recently. The fact that this easing had been most pronounced in growth in exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand industrial production suggested it may have been affected by US–China trade tensions, given\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe integration of east Asian economies in global manufacturing supply chains.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodity prices, in particular those for bulk commodities, had held up by more than had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected over the previous year. In part, this reflected a number of unforeseen disruptions to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply, particularly for coking coal. Members noted that, in addition, global steel demand had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen stronger than anticipated. Oil prices had also risen, which had increased Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of trade. Although Australia is a net importer of oil, Australian exports of liquefied\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural gas (LNG) and other oil-related products – the prices of which are linked to oil prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– are larger, following a sustained period of strong growth. Along with a higher starting point\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a result of commodity prices having held up, the forecast for Australia's terms of trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been revised higher for the next few years owing to a reassessment of the expected strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin global demand for commodities, particularly from China and India.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the recent run of economic data suggested that growth in the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy had been higher over the year to the June quarter than earlier forecast, and above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testimates of potential growth. Labour market conditions had remained strong and other available\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators pointed to further solid GDP growth in the September quarter. At the same time,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation in the September quarter had slowed as expected, partly as a result of a large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy-induced decline in childcare prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth was expected to be around 3½ per cent on average over 2018 and 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that growth would be supported by accommodative monetary policy, above-trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in Australia's major trading partners and a stronger profile for the terms of trade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYear-ended GDP growth was expected to ease to around 3 per cent towards the end of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2020 because LNG exports were expected to reach capacity production levels by the end of 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumption had continued to grow by around 3 per cent in year-ended terms, despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tongoing low growth in household income. Growth in retail sales had been volatile on a quarterly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis, although in year-ended terms growth had been fairly steady at a relatively modest rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions had continued to differ across states; retail sales had been relatively strong in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVictoria but had declined in Western Australia. Members noted that the strong pace of growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail spending online in recent years could be one factor contributing to subdued conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail rental markets. Year-ended growth in household consumption was expected to remain around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3 per cent over the following few years. Growth in household disposable income was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast to increase to a similar rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough residential building approvals had fallen in the September quarter and liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that pre-sales had become harder to obtain, the large pipeline of work yet to be done\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to support dwelling investment at a high level over the following year or two.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that population growth was expected to remain fairly strong over the following few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears, and that this would provide some support to housing demand. However, there had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treports that bank financing of large development projects had become more difficult,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in areas where there had already been substantial development.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that established housing prices had fallen further in Sydney and Melbourne. After\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising by more than apartment prices in preceding years, house prices had fallen by more than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapartment prices since 2017. Conditions in the established housing market had been stable in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost other cities, although housing prices had declined a little further in Perth in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths. Rental vacancies had increased in Sydney, consistent with the additions to the stock of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing over the past year, and rent inflation had remained low across the country.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that business investment had been stronger than forecast a year earlier. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent strength in non-mining business investment was expected to continue and to make a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant contribution to output growth over the forecast period. Private non-residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction was expected to be supported by above-average business conditions and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant pipeline of non-residential construction work that had been approved. Expenditure on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmachinery and equipment was also expected to rise over the forecast period. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmining investment had not fallen by as much as expected over the previous year, largely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting additional spending on the remaining LNG projects under construction. The trough in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmining investment was still expected to occur in late 2018 or early 2019.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExports had continued to make a significant contribution to growth in output over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear. Resource exports had increased further, mainly because production of LNG had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tramp up. Service and manufacturing exports had been supported by strong global growth and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the Australian dollar over 2018. The persistent drought conditions in New South\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWales and bordering regions in Queensland and Victoria had led to a short-term boost to rural\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports because livestock slaughter rates had increased and some grain crops had been harvested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearly to take advantage of higher feed prices. However, the medium-term outlook for farm sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction had been revised lower.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market conditions had been stronger than expected. Members noted that much of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth had been in full-time employment and that the participation rate had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a high level. The unemployment rate had declined to 5 per cent in September.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnemployment rates in most states had trended lower in recent months and were particularly low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin New South Wales and Victoria. The unemployment rate was now expected to decline gradually to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 4¾ per cent by mid 2020, although members noted that some leading\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of labour demand suggested there could be a more pronounced decline in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate in the near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe improved labour market outlook had led to a modest upward revision to the outlook for wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. The recent increases in award and minimum wages were expected to have provided a small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboost to wages growth in the September quarter. Members discussed the wage increases associated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith recent enterprise bargaining agreements and uncertainties around the extent to which these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ongoing negotiations might flow through to overall wages growth. Members noted that average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treal earnings had not increased for six years and that wages growth was a key uncertainty for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth future consumption growth and inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYear-ended inflation had remained low in the September quarter. CPI inflation was 1.9 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the September quarter and had been around 2 per cent since early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2017. Underlying inflation was a little below ½ per cent in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter and around 1¾ per cent over the year. As expected, the quarterly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutcome incorporated a large decline in administered prices, reflecting a sharp decline in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchildcare prices owing to changes in government subsidies and a moderation in utilities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation. The noticeable step-down in administered price inflation from earlier years was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to be temporary, although members noted that future outcomes depended on possible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment initiatives to reduce cost-of-living pressures. Inflation in the cost of new housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand rents had also been subdued in the September quarter. Inflation was still forecast to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease gradually over time as spare capacity in the economy declines. The brighter outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic activity and the labour market, compared with three months earlier, had led to a small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupward revision to the inflation forecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the advanced economies remained accommodative, although they had tightened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat recently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn October, equity prices had declined sharply across the major markets. Analysts had attributed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fall to a range of factors, including higher bond yields, concerns that the pace of earnings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth would decline given trade tensions and building cost pressures, and elevated valuations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(particularly in the United States). Members noted, however, that recent corporate earnings,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially in the United States, had grown strongly and had mostly been above forecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that there had generally been little spillover from equity markets to other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial markets. Money market and corporate bond spreads had increased a little but remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively low. Term premia for sovereign debt and exchange rate volatility also remained low in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe major markets. Members noted that the leveraged loan market had grown rapidly, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States, and corporate funding had increasingly shifted to the securities markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than bank finance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMonetary policy in the major economies remained accommodative. Members noted that financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket pricing continued to imply that policy settings of central banks are on divergent paths,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting differences in spare capacity and/or the inflation outlook across economies. In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States and Canada, markets were pricing in a further tightening in monetary policy over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe coming year. Financial market pricing continued to imply a lower path for the US federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds rate than suggested by the median projection of Federal Open Market Committee members.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket pricing implied a smaller increase in policy rates over the coming year in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKingdom, Norway and Sweden, with rates expected to remain very low in these economies. By\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrast, market pricing was consistent with policy rates remaining steady over the following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear in Australia and New Zealand, where policy rates had not been lowered to the extent they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad in some other economies. In Japan, the euro area and Switzerland, market pricing remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with maintenance of the highly accommodative monetary policy settings in these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the divergent monetary policy paths had been reflected in long-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields, which had increased in the United States and Canada over the prior year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut had been broadly unchanged in other major markets and Australia. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong-term government bond yields in Australia were now clearly below those in the United States\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a result. Members also noted that long-term government bond yields remained low by historical\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards in the major markets, with inflation expectations contained and term premia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Italy, the spread of Italian government bond yields over German Bunds had risen further in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober, following the rejection by the European Commission of the Italian Government's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdraft budget. However, Italian yield spreads remained below the levels seen during the European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt crisis in 2012 and there had been limited spillovers to other European bond markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, ongoing concerns about Italian fiscal policy settings were likely to remain a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfocus for financial market participants.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial conditions in emerging markets had stabilised recently, as earlier political and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmacro-financial concerns in Turkey, Argentina and Brazil had eased somewhat. After depreciating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply since the beginning of 2018, these economies' exchange rates had appreciated over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe preceding couple of months. This followed some corrective policy responses and an easing in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperceived political risk. Exchange rate volatility had also declined from its recent peak across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerging market economies more broadly. However, members noted that there remained a risk that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital outflows from emerging markets could broaden and intensify, prompting a more significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightening of financial conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the authorities had implemented further targeted measures to ease financial conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin response to slower growth, while balancing their commitment to containing risks in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial system. In October, banks' reserve requirement ratios were cut by another\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 percentage point, following earlier measures to ensure ample bank liquidity. The decline in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese share prices over 2018 had also recently prompted the authorities to announce measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto support the equity market. The renminbi exchange rate had depreciated over 2018 in response\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto concerns about trade protection and the outlook for growth, as well as the policy measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttargeted at easing financial conditions. However, unlike the 2015 depreciation episode, there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been few signs of large-scale capital outflows or direct foreign exchange intervention by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe authorities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had depreciated a little over the course of 2018, but remained in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfairly narrow range observed over recent years on a trade-weighted basis. Members observed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis had reflected offsetting effects on the exchange rate from higher commodity prices, on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone hand, and the decline in Australian bond yields relative to those in other major markets, on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that Australian banks' funding costs remained a little higher than in 2017,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting the increase in short-term money market rates over the first half of 2018. More\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently, the spread of bank bill swap rates relative to overnight indexed swaps (OIS) had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined marginally over the preceding month, while the spread of US LIBOR to OIS had increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInformation from liaison suggested that there had been little change in domestic money market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in recent months. The modest increase in funding costs earlier in the year had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed on by most lenders to existing borrowers with variable-rate business and housing loans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe pace of overall credit growth had been maintained in recent months, as slowing housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth had been offset by a pick-up in business credit growth. The easing in growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing credit had reflected a slowing in growth in lending by the major banks. By contrast,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in housing lending by other authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) had picked up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing lending by non-ADIs had continued to grow strongly, although these institutions'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of total housing credit remained small. Members noted that the easing in housing credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been accounted for largely by slower growth in credit extended to investors, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now close to zero. Growth in lending to owner-occupiers had eased more gradually and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained around 6½ per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the easing in housing credit growth was likely to reflect both tighter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending conditions and some weakening in demand. Stricter lending criteria had reduced maximum\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloan amounts. At the same time, however, interest rates offered on new loans remained lower than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates on outstanding loans, consistent with banks continuing to compete for new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs part of a regular annual review process, members considered how the domestic economy had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevolved over the preceding year relative to the Bank's forecasts of a year earlier. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the magnitude of forecast errors for key variables, including GDP growth, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate and inflation, had been smaller than the historical averages. Overall, GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been higher than expected at the time of the November 2017 <cite>Statement on Monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPolicy</cite>. While most components of GDP had turned out to be a little stronger than expected, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmain source of the upward surprise had been business investment, owing to unexpected strength in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth mining and non-mining investment. In addition, the terms of trade had been higher than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected over the previous year and the Australian dollar had depreciated. Consistent with these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments, labour market outcomes had also been stronger than expected a year earlier and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore progress had been made in reducing unemployment than expected. Despite this, wages growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand underlying inflation had evolved largely as expected. Overall, members noted that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic outcomes over the preceding year had been consistent with the economy continuing on its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast trajectory of gradually declining spare capacity, with a correspondingly gradual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in wages growth and inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the context of the annual review of the forecasts, members also reviewed arguments that had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen advanced by various commentators during the preceding year for an increase or decrease in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate. Some of these arguments relied on different assessments than had been made by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard in relation to the benefits of seeking faster progress on the Bank's inflation and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate objectives, versus the risks to longer-term sustainable growth from further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in household debt. Other arguments for a change in the cash rate relied on an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talternative assessment about the economic outlook and/or the risks around the outlook. Arguments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin favour of an increase in the cash rate included that the economy had more momentum than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassessed by the Bank; financial stability risks from high levels of household debt required\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher interest rates; and a higher cash rate would create room to cut the cash rate in future\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin response to an adverse event. The prime argument in favour of a decrease in the cash rate was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat easier monetary policy could lead to faster progress in achieving the Bank's monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy objectives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed how different scenarios could affect the monetary policy decision, noting that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe appropriate policy response would depend on the specifics of the situation, including the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderlying factors driving economic developments. For example, in the event of a marked change\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the strength of the global economy, the effect on the Australian economy – and thus the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappropriate monetary policy response – would depend on any associated move in the exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Australian dollar. Members also discussed various scenarios related to the labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand household expenditure.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the current month's decision, members noted that the global economy had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto grow strongly and global financial conditions remained accommodative, although conditions had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightened somewhat recently. Most advanced economies were growing at above-trend rates and their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour markets had continued to tighten. This had led to a noticeable pick-up in wages growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn some economies, most notably the United States, inflationary pressures were building. Growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin China had slowed a little and the authorities had responded to weakness in some sectors of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy with targeted policy measures, while continuing to pay close attention to risks in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe financial sector. Members noted that the direction of international trade policy continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be a significant risk to the global outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAgainst the background of rising global inflationary pressures, a few central banks, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US Federal Reserve, were expected to continue to reduce the degree of monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodation gradually. Changes in the expected paths of monetary policy over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear had been reflected in changes to financial market pricing, most notably a broad-based\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappreciation of the US dollar. The associated modest depreciation of the Australian dollar over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2018 was likely to have been helpful for domestic economic growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that economic conditions in the Australian economy had continued to improve and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a little stronger than expected. The outlook for growth had been revised a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher, mainly as a result of upward revisions to history and recent strong data. Year-ended GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was expected to remain above 3 per cent over 2019, before slowing to around 3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2020. Members observed that the outlook for consumption continued to be a source of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty in an environment of slow growth in household incomes, high debt levels and easing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in housing markets in some parts of the country. These conditions warranted close\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonitoring. At the same time, investment had been stronger than expected over the previous year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand business conditions were positive; if the recent momentum were to be sustained, business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment could turn out to be stronger than currently expected. However, the drought had led\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto difficult conditions in parts of the farm sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the labour market had also been stronger than expected and forward-looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of labour demand continued to point to ongoing strength in the near term. As a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult, the forecast for the unemployment rate had been revised lower and the forecast for wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been revised slightly higher. Members noted that there continued to be uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the degree of spare capacity in the labour market and the extent and speed of any pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin wages growth relative to the gradual increase incorporated in the latest forecasts. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacknowledged that a gradual increase in wages growth was likely to be necessary for inflation to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe sustainably within the target range.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderlying inflation had remained low and stable at around 1¾ per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the previous forecasts, despite stronger-than-expected economic activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough there was a possibility of further declines in administered prices in the year ahead,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually over the forecast period, to be a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove 2¼ per cent in 2020.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets had continued to ease, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant growth over preceding years. Rent inflation had remained low. Housing credit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined, particularly for investors, but had continued to be higher than growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold income. Credit conditions were tighter than they had been for some time, partly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause lending standards had been tightened following the introduction of supervisory measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto help contain the build-up of risk in household balance sheets. At the same time, home lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates had remained low and there was strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking account of the available information on current economic and financial conditions, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as the latest forecasts, members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to support economic growth and allow for further gradual progress to be made in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese circumstances, members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate was more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be an increase than a decrease, but that there was no strong case for a near-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of stability and confidence while this progress\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunfolds. Members judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Further reductions in production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof bulk commodities by high-cost producers in China had contributed to these price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases. Reflecting the rise in commodity prices since earlier in the year, the terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade had increased in the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ABS capital expenditure survey and measures of work done on non-residential construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that mining investment had continued to fall in the June quarter, in line with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast presented in the August <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. The estimate of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnominal investment intentions from the capital expenditure survey implied a further large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in mining investment in 2016/17, in line with earlier expectations. However, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpeak subtraction from GDP growth was still expected to have occurred in 2015/16 and members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that there had been some signs of an improvement in sentiment in parts of the mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that developments in commodity prices and mining investment had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have significant effects on economic activity in resource-rich regions of the country and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the effect of the spillovers from the decline in mining investment and commodity prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould persist for some time. The regional differences had been apparent in labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutcomes. Members noted that a decline in full-time employment since the beginning of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear had been recorded in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland, but that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpart-time employment growth had been broadly based across the country. The relative strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof part-time employment had partly reflected growth in industries that have a higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproportion of part-time jobs, such as household services, although liaison contacts had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treported that employers more generally had been taking a cautious approach to hiring.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tForward-looking indicators suggested that employment growth would remain relatively subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin Western Australia and Queensland but would be stronger elsewhere. Overall, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforward-looking indicators were consistent with little change in the unemployment rate in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe coming months; the unemployment rate had fallen slightly in July to 5.7 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in the aggregate wage price index (WPI) had stabilised at low levels; the private\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsector WPI had increased by 0.5 per cent in each of the past six quarters. Growth in the WPI\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued to be lowest in the mining-exposed industries and states, although it also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlooked to have stabilised in these areas.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the June quarter national accounts, which would be released the day after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe meeting, were expected to record moderate GDP growth. Net exports were expected to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmade a smaller contribution to GDP growth following strong growth in resource exports in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch quarter, whereas data released during the meeting indicated that public demand had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmade a noticeable contribution in the June quarter. Over the first half of the year, GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been expected to have been close to estimates of potential, which was consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the slight change in the unemployment rate that had been observed over that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in household consumption was expected to have remained around average in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Household perceptions of their personal finances had continued to be above average,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talthough growth in retail sales had declined slightly in recent months. Members discussed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effect of lower interest rates on consumption growth via the cash flow channel of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy. They noted that the positive effect of lower interest rates on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisposable income of borrowing households is larger than the negative effect on the income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof lender households, as the average borrower household has two-to-three times more net\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest-bearing debt than the average lender household has in net interest-earning assets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn addition, on average, borrower households are likely to be significantly more responsive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto changes in income that are related to changes in interest rates because they are more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be liquidity constrained. Members noted that, since the global financial crisis,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tborrower households have been likely to use more of an increase in their cash flow from any\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsource to prepay their debt, which might imply a delay in the response of consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspending to lower interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivate residential building approvals had increased in July, to be around the high levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved in 2015, and there continued to be a significant amount of work in the pipeline.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that this could be expected to support high levels of dwelling investment for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in established housing markets had generally eased over 2016. Growth in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had declined at the national level and across most capital cities over the past year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talthough there remained considerable variation by location. Housing prices had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclining in year-ended terms in Perth for some time. In the rental market, inflation had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained around historical lows and had also eased across most capital cities, most notably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin Perth, where rents had continued to decline. The aggregate rental vacancy rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrifted higher and was close to its long-run average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther indicators for the housing market had also generally pointed to weaker conditions than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta year earlier. In the established housing market, the number of auctions had declined and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained lower than a year earlier, even though auction clearance rates had increased of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlate (particularly in Sydney). In the private treaty market – where, nationally, over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t80 per cent of transactions occur – turnover had also declined since the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear and the average number of days that a property was on the market had been on an upward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrend. Members noted that sales of new properties were included in the turnover data, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there might be measurement problems related to the long lag between purchasing and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsettling new properties bought off the plan, which could lead to revisions. Finally, in recent months the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue of housing loan approvals had been broadly steady and housing credit growth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than a year earlier, consistent with the earlier tightening in lending standards and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlow turnover.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment had fallen further in the June quarter, driven by a decline in mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in line with earlier expectations.

The pipeline of non-residential construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twork had remained low, although non-residential approvals had increased a little in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths and survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove their long-run averages.

Across the rest of east Asia, growth in GDP had picked up a little in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, but remained below average in year-ended terms. In the high-income east Asian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, where growth had been relatively subdued, monetary and fiscal policy measures had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen implemented to support domestic demand. In the United States, output had risen modestly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter and growth had eased in year-ended terms, but had remained close to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\testimates of potential growth.

The Japanese labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained very tight and unit labour costs growth had increased relative to long-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taverages, yet both headline and core inflation in year-ended terms had fallen over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsix months or so. In the United States, the unemployment rate was around estimates of full\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployment and this appeared to be putting some upward pressure on wages.

Despite this, core and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theadline inflation in the United States had been little changed in recent months and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained below the Federal Reserve's inflation goal. In the euro area, the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trate had declined gradually since 2013 and employment growth had been increasingly driven by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfull-time employment, but wage growth had remained low and inflation had continued to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the European Central Bank's target.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a relatively quiet month in financial markets, with low turnover in a number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommentary by US Federal Reserve officials had slightly raised market expectations of an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in the federal funds rate, with market pricing indicating that the probability of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan increase by the end of the year was high.

These measures were projected to result in an expansion of the BoE's balance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsheet over 2017, although the BoE's asset holdings as a share of GDP were projected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremain lower than those of the European Central Bank, and well below those of the Bank of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJapan (BoJ). Nevertheless, the share of government securities outstanding held by the BoE\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas relatively high.

The cost of borrowing US dollars in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshort-term money markets had risen further over the past month, ahead of the implementation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof US money market reforms in October. The cost of borrowing US dollars in exchange for yen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand some other currencies in short-term foreign exchange swap markets had also remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\televated. This appeared to reflect strong demand from Japanese investors and banks as they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsearched for yield in light of the BoJ's quantitative easing measures. The profitability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof lending Australian dollar securities for cash, swapping the proceeds into yen and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurchasing Japanese government bonds had pushed Australian short-term secured lending rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigher. Members noted that, prior to the meeting, these developments had had little effect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton Australian banks' funding costs – the spread of the bank bill swap rate to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tovernight index swap rate had declined in recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile currency markets had continued to be influenced by monetary policy developments in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies, there had been little change in the Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar exchange rates over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity markets had been little changed over the past month, while Australian equity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had declined a little, as profit results had been generally somewhat weaker than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected in most sectors.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the reductions in the cash rate in May and August this year had now been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely passed through to deposit rates, with the exception of rates on term deposits, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccount for around 20 per cent of banks' overall funding. Term deposit interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trates for maturities of less than one year, which account for the vast majority, had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed during 2016.

GDP growth over the year was higher than had been forecast a year earlier and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove estimates of potential growth. Overall, growth in output in the September quarter was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to have continued at a moderate pace similar to that seen in the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMining activity had grown over the year to the June quarter by more than had been expected a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear earlier due to a larger-than-expected increase in resource export volumes, which looked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have increased further in July. Notwithstanding this, labour market conditions remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively weak in Queensland and Western Australia, reflecting the effects of earlier falls\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the terms of trade and ongoing declines in mining investment. Members noted that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tramp-up in liquefied natural gas production would make a significant contribution to GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth over the forecast period, but was not expected to lead to many new jobs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-mining activity had grown at around its long-run average rate over the year to the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, supported by low interest rates and the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth had been broadly based and supported by strong growth in public demand. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining investment had been little changed over the past few years even though survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures of business conditions and capacity utilisation had remained above their long-run\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taverages. Growth in output and employment, and business conditions more generally, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to be strongest in the services sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHousehold consumption growth had moderated in the June quarter. This was driven by a decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the consumption of goods, consistent with low growth in retail sales volumes, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in the consumption of services had remained around average. More timely indicators of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold consumption had been mixed: although growth in retail sales had been low over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfew months to July, households' perceptions of their personal finances had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove average. Members noted that future consumption growth would largely depend on growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin household income. Members observed that the household saving ratio had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged in the June quarter but remained on a gradual downward trend, in line with earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment had been increasing more rapidly than housing credit, suggesting that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds were increasing their housing equity at a relatively strong rate. Indeed, private\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelling investment had continued to grow at an above-average rate in the June quarter. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge amount of work in the pipeline and the high level of building approvals in July and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust were expected to support a high level of dwelling investment for some time, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rate of growth in dwelling investment was expected to decline over the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the established housing market, conditions had eased relative to a year earlier, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had been some signs that conditions had strengthened a little more recently. Housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprice growth in Sydney and Melbourne had increased in recent months and auction clearance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trates in these two cities had risen. In contrast, turnover and housing credit growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen noticeably lower than a year earlier and the value of housing loan approvals had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed in recent months. Conditions in the rental market had continued to soften,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in Perth, where population growth had been easing and the rental vacancy rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad risen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndicators of labour market conditions had been mixed. The unemployment rate had declined to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.6 per cent in August and had fallen by around ½ percentage point over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear. However, the underemployment rate, which captures workers who would like to work more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thours, had increased over the past year. Members noted that it was important to consider the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of additional hours workers wanted to work in order to assess the degree of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunderutilisation in the labour force more accurately. They observed that there had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar developments in a number of other countries, including the United States, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspare capacity in the labour market had also not declined to the same extent as implied by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe decline in the unemployment rate. In Australia, part-time work had accounted for all of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe increase in employment since the beginning of the year, with full-time employment having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen little changed. Looking ahead, the increase in job vacancies and advertisements was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with moderate employment growth in the coming months, although outcomes were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to vary across states.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in average earnings per hour recorded in the national accounts – a broader\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasure of earnings than provided by the wage price index – had picked up over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpast two quarters, to be 3 per cent over the year to the June quarter. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprovided some evidence that the downward pressure on earnings from the movement of workers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin high-paying mining-related jobs to lower-paying jobs in the non-mining economy was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twaning. Aggregate unit labour costs had been little changed for almost five years as growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin earnings had been matched by growth in labour productivity.

Over recent years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption growth in Australia's major trading partners had been resilient but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment growth had declined, as had growth of global trade and industrial production.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in China appeared to have stabilised in recent months, supported by fiscal stimulus\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand accommodative financial conditions. Growth in private investment had shown some signs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstabilising, after declining since late 2011, and consumer spending appeared to be holding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup, consistent with stable labour market conditions. Investment in the residential property\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket had increased and growth in output in some industrial sectors, including steel,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmachinery, equipment and motor vehicle manufacturing, had picked up a little. These\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments had supported Chinese demand for commodities at the same time as Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction of iron ore and coal had been scaled back. As a result, imports of both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodities had been on an upward trend, and iron ore imports from Australia had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround record highs in recent months. Stronger demand and temporary supply disruptions had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributed to increases in spot prices for coal. Members noted that the risks in China\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassociated with the build-up of debt in an environment of slower growth and questions about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sustainability of current policy settings remained a source of concern for economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprospects in China.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodity prices overall had increased since the previous meeting and were well above the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlows recorded earlier in the year. Australia's terms of trade were expected to rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagain in the September quarter, following the first increase in a few years in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Members noted that if the terms of trade were to be little changed over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast period, as expected, it would be more positive for profits, wages and fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevenues than if the decline in the terms of trade seen over recent years were to continue.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the major advanced economies, growth in output had been sufficient for labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions to improve further. This, in turn, had contributed to relatively strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption growth. In contrast, growth in investment had remained subdued in most advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. Despite continued declines in unemployment, unit labour cost growth had eased in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJapan and remained low in the euro area, and inflation had remained below the central bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget in both economies. In contrast, the tighter labour market conditions in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStates had contributed to further increases in unit labour cost growth, which had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly correlated with movements in underlying inflation over time. However, inflation was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill a little below the Federal Reserve's goal.

Members noted that some risks from household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlending had lessened a little further over the past six months. Lending standards had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthened and housing credit growth had slowed. The level of non-performing mortgage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tloans had risen over 2016 to date, but remained low. The household debt-to-income ratio was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh and drifting up, although most other indicators suggested that household finances were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin reasonable shape.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRisks around the projected large increases in supply in some inner-city apartment markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased. In commercial property markets more generally yields had continued to fall.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions were weak in Brisbane and Perth, because demand for office space from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresource-related firms had declined; in contrast, the Sydney and Melbourne markets were much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger. Non-performing business loan ratios had picked up a little, largely driven by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tloans to firms linked to the resources sector.

In many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trespects, banks had become more resilient over the previous year or so by raising capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand rebalancing their businesses away from some less profitable activities overseas. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad also taken a more cautious and selective approach to domestic business lines, such as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlending to property developers. This business had been growing quickly in recent years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly at local branches of banks with headquarters in Asia. Capital ratios had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained high. Members noted that it would be important that banks' efforts to maintain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent levels of profitability did not result in increased systemic risk.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, developments in the global economy had been slightly more positive leading up to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe meeting. Although the Chinese economy was still facing a difficult transition, growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChina appeared to have stabilised and demand for commodities had been resilient. At the same\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, some reduction in the supply of commodities had contributed to an increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices since the turn of the year. This had supported a rise in Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of trade around the middle of this year. Members observed that the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstabilisation in the terms of trade around current levels would see an end to the drag on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincomes from the persistent decline in the terms of trade over recent years.

Over the year to the June quarter, GDP growth had been a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove estimates of potential, driven mainly by growth in resource exports that had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger than expected a year earlier. Growth in the June quarter had been more moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan in the March quarter. Recent data were consistent with further moderate growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter. This implied that, in year-ended terms, growth was expected to decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat in the near term before rising gradually.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere remained a degree of uncertainty about the momentum in the labour market. While the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had edged down a little further in previous months, broader measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour underutilisation had not declined. This was consistent with part-time work having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccounted for all of the increase in employment over the year to date and the relative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength of the household services sector, which employs a higher-than-average share of part-time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworkers. National accounts data had provided some further tentative evidence that growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployee earnings had stabilised. This was consistent with less downward pressure on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearnings associated with the movement of labour from mining to the non-mining sectors of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the housing market had been mixed over prior months. The effects of tighter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlending standards had been apparent in indicators such as the shares of interest-only loans\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand loans with high loan-to-valuation ratios in new lending, both of which had declined over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past year. Turnover had declined and housing credit growth had been steady at a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticeably lower rate than a year earlier. Although the rate of increase in housing prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been lower than a year earlier, growth in housing prices and auction clearance rates had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthened in Sydney and Melbourne in the months leading up to the meeting. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat considerable supply of apartments was scheduled to come on stream over the next couple\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Overall, members assessed that while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe risks associated with rapid growth in housing prices and lending had receded over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpast year, developments would need to be monitored closely.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince the September meeting, the data on the domestic economy had been broadly consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the forecasts presented in the August <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment to the decline in mining investment was well advanced; headwinds from that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment and the earlier fall in the terms of trade appeared to be waning. The adjustment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been assisted by low interest rates, which had been supporting domestic demand. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taddition, the lower exchange rate since 2013 had been helping the traded sector, though an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappreciating exchange rate could complicate this. There was a reasonable prospect of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsustaining growth in economic activity that would support further employment growth and, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, a gradual increase in wage growth and inflation.

Commodity prices and the terms of trade,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthough, had fallen by more than expected over this period, partly because global commodity production had been more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresilient and demand, particularly from China, had been lower than expected. The staff's analysis also indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the spillovers from falling commodity prices and the associated declines in mining investment had been larger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan expected over this period. At the same time, wage growth had generally been lower than implied by its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thistorical relationship with the unemployment rate. The decline in wage growth had been a helpful part of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment of the economy to the end of the resources boom. The depreciation of the Australian dollar was also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thelpful, although that had occurred later and was somewhat less than inferred by its historical relationship with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe terms of trade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the latest forecasts, which were little changed from those presented three months earlier, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved that bulk commodity prices had increased significantly since the beginning of 2016. Consequently, the terms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof trade had risen for the first time in two and a half years and had been revised higher over the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted, however, that there was significant uncertainty about the outlook for the terms of trade, partly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of uncertainty about the outlook for the Chinese economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs expected, Australia's GDP growth appeared to have moderated around the middle of the year following strong growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter. GDP growth was expected to decline in year-ended terms before increasing to be above potential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth later in the forecast period. Growth in resource exports was forecast to continue to make a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontribution to output growth, while the drag on growth from falling mining investment was projected to diminish.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in non-mining activity was expected to continue at around an average pace.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumption growth had been below average in the June quarter, consistent with slower growth in retail sales. Since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthen, retail sales growth appeared to have remained modest, although measures of consumer sentiment regarding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpersonal finances had risen and were clearly above average. Despite this, consumption was expected to continue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking a large contribution to growth in overall expenditure over the forecast period and to grow faster than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold disposable income, which implied a further gradual decline in the saving ratio. Members noted that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas significant uncertainty about the outlook for consumption growth given uncertainty about households'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations of their income growth and the influence of these expectations on their spending and saving decisions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was particularly pronounced for households with significant debt.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe value of building approvals had reached record levels as a share of GDP and the amount of work in the pipeline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad edged higher, suggesting that dwelling investment would support growth for some time yet. Conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\testablished housing markets had continued to diverge across the country. Housing price growth in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne had increased noticeably since earlier in the year. Members noted that high and rising population growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin Victoria, which reflected population inflows from both overseas and other parts of Australia, had supported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in Melbourne's housing market. In contrast, housing market conditions had been particularly weak in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerth, where population growth had declined from earlier high rates, rental vacancy rates had risen and rents had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen. Nationally, housing credit growth had remained lower than a year earlier at around 6 per cent per annum,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talthough loan approvals to investors had picked up over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that revisions to the annual national accounts data for the preceding few years had been minimal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor most key aggregates, including consumption and business investment. However, some business investment had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t‘reclassified’ from the non-mining sector to the mining sector. The new data suggested that mining investment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpeaked at a higher level than previously recorded and that non-mining business investment had declined a little in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe lead-up to the peak in mining investment. Subsequently, non-mining business investment had recorded modest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, in contrast to the earlier vintage of data, which had implied no growth in non-mining business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover the preceding few years. The revisions to non-mining investment were more consistent with survey measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness conditions and capacity utilisation, which had been on an upward trend for some time and above their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong-run averages over the preceding two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data confirmed that employment growth had been concentrated in part-time employment and had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline over recent months. In addition, the participation rate had fallen to levels last seen in late 2014. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the current experience of relatively strong growth in part-time employment (compared with full-time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployment) was unusual insofar as such a pattern was typically associated with rising unemployment rates. While the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had declined in previous months and over the previous year, the underemployment rate had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\televated. Members noted that the degree of spare capacity in the labour market depended on how many additional hours\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworkers were seeking and that relevant data were not readily available.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unemployment rate was expected to edge lower, which was little changed from the outlook presented three months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier. The forecasts incorporated a small downward revision to the outlook for both employment growth and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of the participation rate, largely to reflect recent data and information from forward-looking indicators,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich pointed to modest employment growth in the months ahead. Members observed that there was uncertainty about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdegree of spare capacity in the labour market and how this might ultimately affect inflationary pressures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the earlier forecasts had over-predicted wage growth since 2011. This in part reflected the fact\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there had been more spare capacity in the labour market than forecast in the years immediately following the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the resources boom and that commodity prices had fallen by more than expected. Members also noted, however,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat many advanced economies had experienced lower-than-expected wage growth, even those considered to be close to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfull employment. More recently, there had been evidence that wage growth in Australia had stabilised and that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on aggregate measures of labour costs of workers moving from mining-related activities to lower-paying jobs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the non-mining sector might almost have run its course. Members discussed the joint analytical work conducted by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Bank and the Australian Bureau of Statistics on micro-level wage price index data, which showed that a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant fall in the proportion of jobs receiving wage increases of more than 4 per cent had been part of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe explanation of lower aggregate wage growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderlying inflation had remained around 1½ per cent in year-ended terms in the September quarter, much as had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected. Headline inflation was 1.3 per cent, with a notable contribution from fruit and vegetable prices in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter. Petrol prices had subtracted from CPI inflation over the year, but were expected to add a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto headline inflation in the December quarter. The recent CPI data had confirmed that domestic cost pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained subdued, which was particularly evident in prices of market services. Also, rental inflation had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery low and there had been a broad-based decline in growth in dwelling construction costs, which was somewhat at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\todds with the strength of housing construction in many parts of the country. The prices of tradable items (excluding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatile items and tobacco) had fallen slightly in the September quarter but were unchanged over the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that there had been little change to the underlying inflation forecast.

Growth in labour costs was expected to increase gradually over the forecast period, consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther gradual improvements in the labour market and the end of the drag on growth from falling mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the earlier decline in the terms of trade. Moreover, the disinflationary effect from heightened retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition was expected to dissipate over time. On the other hand, low rental inflation was expected to persist –\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting the strength of additions to the housing stock – while the boost to the prices of tradable items from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier depreciation of the exchange rate was likely to have run its course.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in Australia's major trading partners had been a little below average over the prior year.

Although the growth in construction activity had supported an increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction in industries that supply construction materials, including steel, there was still overcapacity in some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of the industrial sector and growth in private sector fixed asset investment had remained subdued. At the same\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, the authorities had restricted the domestic production of bulk commodities, which had contributed to a rise in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcoal prices. Higher commodity prices had been associated with a more broadly based increase in producer prices in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChina over recent months, following a few years of noticeable deflation.

Based on the currently available indicators, it was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat GDP would be broadly flat in the December quarter, a relatively good result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin comparison with other developed economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe run of regular data releases reviewed by the Board covered the business, household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand housing sectors, the labour market, and prices and wages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the business sector, indicators from a range of business surveys suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment spending was likely to slow markedly in the current financial year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter the strong outcomes of recent years. Members were briefed that plans\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor future investment appeared to have been scaled back sharply in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Business surveys suggested a fall to well below average levels. Data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton approvals for non-residential building fell in the December quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to other indicators, members noted that there had been a large fall in business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence, as measured by the NAB survey, in October and November. This took\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence to a level below that seen in the early 1990s. However, the survey's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasure of business conditions had fallen by a lesser extent, and capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutilisation had eased only gradually over the past year, from a record level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto about average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in business credit had slowed sharply from the very high rates of a year ago.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, business credit outstanding had fallen in the month of December, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis appeared to have been affected by special factors. The slowing in credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprobably reflected a combination of tighter lending standards and businesses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseeking to reduce debt. According to the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses in this sector had found it increasingly difficult to obtain finance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past year or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the household sector, growth in real disposable incomes had been strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlast year, boosted by lower fuel prices, falls in interest rates and the fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransfers to households in the December quarter. However, there had been significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls in net worth, arising mainly from falls in equity prices, and households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad become more conservative in their financial decisions. Growth in debt had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen slower than growth in incomes, so the debt-to-income ratio had been declining.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales had risen modestly in November. Liaison with retailers conducted by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe staff indicated that sales had picked up noticeably in December, but it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseemed that they had weakened again in January. Consumer sentiment, after having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen sharply around September and October, had picked up a little in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the housing sector, members noted that construction activity remained weak, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals having fallen further in November. However, early reports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere that housing loan approvals had picked up sharply in December, consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith increased interest in display homes, which followed the recent changes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the First Home Owner Grant scheme and lower interest rates. Yet the figures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor housing credit indicated a slowing trend. This suggested that households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not as yet scaled back their loan repayments after recent falls in interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates, preferring instead to pay off debt faster.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the established housing market, house prices fell by about 3 per cent on average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross Australia over 2008. This was very modest compared with the falls in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome other countries. The declines were widespread across the capital cities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past year, though Adelaide was an exception. In the larger capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities the recent falls in house prices were most pronounced at the top end\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the labour market were softening. While employment growth remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositive during 2008, it had slowed and trend growth was now only a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove zero. The forward indicators of job vacancies and employment intentions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom business surveys indicated that further deterioration was in prospect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThus far, however, the unemployment rate had risen only gradually from its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow of 4 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the December quarter CPI and the outlook for growth and inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CPI fell in the quarter, reducing the year-ended rate to 3.7 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost of the fall was attributable to lower petrol prices, but underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso moderated, to a little over 4 per cent. The slowing in the underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation rate was driven by prices of non-tradable items such as housing,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trents and domestic travel. Tradables prices had been expected to pick up following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe depreciation of the exchange rate, but price discounting of motor vehicles\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand other goods had offset this effect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had not been any new data on wages over the past two months, with wages growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrently stable at around 4 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that the staff forecast was for domestic output growth to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly lower than previously expected. This was due to the weaker global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy and a pronounced fall in the terms of trade. Working in the other direction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere the effects of the recent cuts in interest rates, which had flowed through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lending rates faster in Australia than in other countries. The forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso incorporated the effect of an assumed fiscal expansion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe weaker growth profile would place greater downward pressure on inflation, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now forecast to decline towards 2 per cent by the middle of 2011, compared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith 2½ per cent previously. In the near term, the CPI inflation rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to fall rapidly, owing to a fall in petrol prices in the March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, if current prices were sustained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Fiscal Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt this point in the meeting, the Secretary to the Treasury briefed the other members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Board on the outline of the Government's Nation Building and Jobs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpackage, which would be announced later that day.

There had been a noticeable improvement in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in credit markets following the introduction of various remedial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy measures by a range of countries. Nonetheless, sentiment remained fragile.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at policy interest rates, there had been significant rate reductions in both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloped and emerging economies over the past few months, including in most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of Asia and Latin America. The US Federal Reserve had reduced the federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds rate to close to zero, which meant the cumulative reduction since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonset of the financial crisis in the second half of 2007 was more than 500\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis points. With the federal funds rate at its current level, the Fed had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannounced a range of measures described as ‘credit easing’, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfocused on the composition of its balance sheet assets and provision of support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto credit markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn other economies, the European Central Bank lowered its policy rate by 75 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints in December and by a further 50 basis points in January, to 2 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank of Japan had lowered its policy rate closer to zero and had introduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral measures to assist corporate financing. The Bank of England had reduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits bank rate by 150 basis points and had announced an intention to purchase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial assets directly. The Swiss National Bank, having cut rates to ½\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent, was now contemplating additional stimulus measures. And the Reserve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of New Zealand had cut rates by 300 basis points, in two steps, to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that in many countries the central bank rate reductions had flowed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough to lending rates only to a limited extent, in particular for housing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey noted that the transmission of monetary policy changes to lending rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been much more effective in Australia. This reflected the high share of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvariable rate lending in Australia and the fact that domestic financial institutions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad passed on most of the recent declines in funding costs to both new and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texisting loans (though the pass-through to business lending rates in Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been slower and less complete). Members noted that US housing loan rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined somewhat since the announcement by the Fed that it would purchase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmortgage agency paper.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn government bond markets, yields had fallen to post-War lows in many countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome European countries, however, had experienced a sharp widening of spreads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelative to German government bonds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been a large volume of government-guaranteed bank bond issuance around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe world in the past few months. Australian banks had been very active, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad benefitted from strong demand for their bonds. The banks were now well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead of their funding plans and had been able to run down short-term debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto some extent. Spreads had tended to narrow.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS corporate bond spreads had declined from their peaks late last year, but remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh.

In other notable developments, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpound sterling had depreciated significantly and was now at parity with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro, and the Chinese renminbi had moved broadly in line with the US dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past six months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had traded in a wide range over the past two months.

Increased issuance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof government-guaranteed bank bonds had attracted some demand away from bonds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissued by the States, and there had been a widening in spreads between yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton semi-government bonds and Commonwealth Government securities. However, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of yields on semis had nonetheless fallen to low levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were further briefed on the pass-through of policy changes to lending rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia. Most of the December cash rate reduction had been passed on,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand on this occasion the reduction had flowed on to personal and small business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates also. Members noted that lending rates were now below average. A further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduction in the cash rate following this meeting, assuming it was passed on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto borrowers, would push many lending rates to their lowest levels since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1960s.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial companies had raised a large amount of equity, particularly in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, at discounts that were relatively modest by world standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn reviewing developments in business debt, members noted that foreign banks in Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounted for about a quarter of business credit, and that their loans were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfairly evenly spread across the sectors of the economy. The foreign bank sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounted for a negligible amount of housing lending in Australia.

This would need to be kept under review.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that market expectations were for an easing in the official cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 100 basis points at this meeting, with the trough in the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow expected to be around 2 per cent later in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recommendation to the Board was for a reduction in the cash rate of 100 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints to 3.25 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe primary backdrop to members' policy discussion this month was the marked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeterioration in world economic conditions late in 2008. Members had noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat previous meetings that there had been an abrupt change to the outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal economic activity after September, following Lehman's collapse\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the resultant strains in financial markets and declines in asset values.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis had caused a collapse of household and business confidence and a very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharp fall in global demand. The dependence of Asian economies on manufactured\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports meant that they had been severely affected. Domestic demand in Asia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also weakened sharply. This included the Chinese economy, which, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill growing, had slowed markedly. These effects were becoming evident in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economic data that had recently been released. The weakness had in turn\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen reflected in a further significant downward revision to the IMF's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts for growth in both developed and emerging economies in 2009, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now expected to be the weakest in six decades.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that measures taken in developed economies to stabilise their financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystems had contributed to an improvement in the functioning of credit markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past few months. There had also been greater steadiness in commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets since November. The better functioning of markets plus the very significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary and fiscal stimulus that was being put in place in all regions would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassist in promoting global recovery over time.

Importantly, Australia's financial system remained in a relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong condition. Among other things, this had allowed the significant monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy easing starting in September to flow through to large reductions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany lending rates. Nonetheless, the headwinds from the global economy were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery strong and would continue to have a significant negative effect on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic economy in the near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the package of fiscal measures to be announced by the Government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater that day would result in a significant boost to demand during 2009. Even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso, given the contractionary forces coming from abroad and the clear evidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat inflation was on a downward trend again, members judged that another substantial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing of monetary policy at this time was appropriate.

Nonetheless, the substantial measures taken would help to cushion the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy from the contractionary forces coming from abroad and, over time, work\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto establish conditions conducive to stronger demand later in the year.

More recent economic data showed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther deterioration in the labour market and ongoing weakness in the housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, with house prices continuing to fall on some measures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the December quarter, Japan recorded its largest fall in quarterly GDP in over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree decades.

Declines in house prices in the past few months had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainly been in the more expensive suburbs, with prices in other suburbs appearing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto level out. In a sign of increased demand for housing, patterns of housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinance indicated an increase in housing loan approvals of about 10 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past few months, partly spurred by the increased incentives for first\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thome buyers to enter the market. However, credit growth had remained low as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowers had evidently taken advantage of the extra cash flows created by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower lending interest rates to increase debt repayments. Further signs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan increased level of activity in the secondary housing market were significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trises in auction clearance rates in both Sydney and Melbourne in February,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a component of the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that current conditions were conducive to buying a dwelling.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that business investment was still growing during the latter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths of 2008, and had now recorded seven years of double-digit growth on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage. However, it was clear that investment spending plans for the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead were now being scaled back. For instance, non-residential building approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen by more than half over the past year or so, and this weakness would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflow into construction activity over the period ahead. Commercial loan approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined through 2008. Usage of credit facilities had declined less than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit limits, suggesting some tightening in credit conditions.

As a consequence,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor equity markets had fallen back to or below the low points reached last\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember, with financial stocks particularly weak.

Although significant macroeconomic policy stimulus\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been put in place in many countries, it was too soon to see the effects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof those measures; in some cases fiscal stimulus had been announced but not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyet implemented.

Output in Australia's trading partners,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweighted by their share in world GDP, therefore appeared likely to have declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby around 3 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Revised forecasts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom international agencies such as the IMF and OECD now showed an expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfall in output in 2009, for the first time in at least 60 years. The IMF\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts were for growth of around 2 per cent in 2010, which implicitly assumed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta return to growth in the second half of 2009.

News in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelation to the housing sector included a modest rise in housing starts in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary and a further decline in the stock of unsold new houses. Labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions remained very weak, with a further large fall in non-farm payrolls\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin March and a rise in the unemployment rate to 8½ per cent. Coincident\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of activity suggested that GDP in the March quarter would be likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fall by around the same rate as in the December quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Asia, the economic news from Japan remained very poor. A further sharp fall in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production in February took the overall decline in the past few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths to nearly 40 per cent, with production now around the level prevailing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the early 1980s. In China, however, there had been signs of improvement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the economic data, with a key measure of business activity picking up relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply in the past two months. Steel production had also increased, as had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production more generally, though the timing of the Chinese New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYear meant these data needed to be interpreted with caution. Elsewhere in east\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsia, key monthly indicators of production and exports appeared to have bottomed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the early months of 2009 after very sharp falls in the December quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the latest economic data from Europe were less encouraging. GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and overall sentiment showed little sign of improvement in the euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarea, and industrial production had fallen steeply in eastern Europe in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the New Zealand economy were weak.

Non-farm GDP had been somewhat weaker in the quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand higher output in the farm sector had supported overall GDP. The latest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tset of indicators suggested that GDP was likely to have fallen again in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers then considered in detail the information provided by the more timely data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treleases.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales had fallen in February, but, as this had followed strong growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious two months, the level of sales was still higher than prior to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal stimulus late in 2008. The year-ended growth of retail sales in New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSouth Wales was now approaching that of the rest of the country, after a period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof over a year in which it had lagged considerably. Household spending had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen supported by a sharp decline in interest payments. As a share of household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisposable income, these had fallen by several percentage points in the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsix months. However, household net worth was estimated to have fallen further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter. Members noted that consumer sentiment in Australia had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen by significantly less than the average for some major economies, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of consumer sentiment were now well below those seen in the early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1990s. This was not the case in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the housing sector, indicators pointed to weakness in building activity in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst half of this year, though increasing demand from first-home buyers was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupporting parts of the established housing market. Building approvals had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased in February, but remained at low levels. There had been a sharp rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the number of grants to first-home buyers, following the increase in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsize of the grant. On house prices, indications were that the top end of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket was soft but the lower end had firmed, owing to strong demand from first-home\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuyers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed that business investment had continued to grow in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, with growth over the year of more than 10 per cent. However, survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation indicated that investment plans had been scaled back considerably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past few months. This was likely to show up in the data on actual investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring the course of this year. Non-residential building approvals had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery sharply over the past year or so; although construction activity had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover 2008, it was likely to fall in the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness conditions were weak in the early months of the year. Activity in the manufacturing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector remained well below average levels. Business debt funding had fallen,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith businesses repaying debt in net terms in the past two months, for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst time in 15 years. There was some evidence that the decline in business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit was largely due to weaker demand for loans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn a more positive note, members observed that metals prices had stabilised since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2008, with prices for several base metals having risen noticeably in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month or so. Indicators of freight costs had also stabilised after falling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery rapidly in the second half of 2008, which suggested the decline in world\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade had been arrested. Despite these signs of stability in external demand,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe falls in commodity prices over 2008 meant that the terms of trade were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast to fall during the period ahead, as new contracts for coal and iron\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tore came into effect. However, the expected level of the terms of trade over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next year or so was still relatively high.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the labour market had continued to soften. While part-time employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased in recent months, the full-time component had fallen steadily\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince mid 2008 and the unemployment rate had risen. Further falls in employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand rises in unemployment were expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite the weakening labour market, wages, as measured by average earnings in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnational accounts, had risen by around 6 per cent over 2008, well above its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent average. Members were briefed, however, that the wage price index gave\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta more accurate picture of wage developments. This series had increased by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 4¼ per cent over the year to the December quarter. Moreover,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures of labour costs from a range of business surveys indicated that wage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was expected to moderate in the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that there had been further downward revisions to the staff\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts for growth and inflation. GDP was expected to fall in 2009 but increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain in 2010. The revised outlook for growth, and the associated reduced level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof capacity utilisation, would entail stronger downward pressure on medium-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation than previously forecast.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that sentiment in global financial markets had fluctuated during March.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInitially, sentiment in the major markets fell as concerns about the health\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof financial institutions again came to the fore, but it improved following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe announcement of details of the US plan to stabilise its financial system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSubsequent positive earnings announcements by some US banks had also helped.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a result of the lift in sentiment, equity markets rose noticeably in net terms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the course of March. There was a strong rally in equity prices in emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets. In Australia, equity prices rose generally in line with those in other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial countries, with most of the rise attributable to higher prices of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshares in the resources and financial sectors.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal bond yields had fallen after the announcement by the Federal Reserve that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit would increase its bond purchases. However, some of this fall had subsequently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen reversed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at monetary policy settings around the world, members were informed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough the European Central Bank had lowered its policy rate by 25 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints, which was less than had been expected by the market, the effective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro area interbank rate had fallen significantly below the policy rate and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe central bank's balance sheet had expanded. Along with the Federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve, the Bank of Japan had moved further to implement unconventional policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures to stimulate borrowing and economic activity in Japan. Elsewhere in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial countries, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada had lowered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates by 50 basis points, and the Swiss National Bank had reduced its policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate by 25 basis points and was purchasing corporate bonds. While there was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow little scope for lower policy rates in most industrial countries, over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past month there had been significant monetary policy easing in many emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, conditions in credit markets had become more positive over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth. Spreads on short-term debt had fallen considerably. In other signs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally improving conditions, banks' demand for funds at the Reserve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank had declined, leading to exchange settlement balances settling at around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$3 billion and a run-off in term deposits at the Bank.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to bond issuance, members noted that there had been strong non-financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporate bond issuance in the United States in the first quarter of 2009 across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rating spectrum; financials had also done a considerable amount of issuance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, there had been several large bond issues over the past month, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome retail issues. Spreads were high, but there were signs that investors'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappetite for corporate debt may have improved somewhat. There had also been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta high level of equity raisings in Australia in the first quarter, notably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby non-financial companies. Members observed that activity in the syndicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending market had been largely confined to refinancing of existing facilities,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut both Australian and foreign lenders had participated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIssuance of guaranteed bank debt had continued to grow rapidly globally, though issuance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Australian banks had dropped back somewhat in the past month after being\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery strong in the preceding three months. Recent issues by Australian banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been mostly onshore and included an unguaranteed issue at a competitive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspread relative to guaranteed issues. Overall, the Australian banks remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell ahead of schedule on bond funding; deposit growth had also been strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the major foreign currency markets, members noted that there had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta sizeable net depreciation of the US dollar over the past month. Nonetheless,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US dollar was still significantly higher than a year ago.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImproved sentiment in global markets had led to increased demand for the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar. The currency had appreciated against the US dollar over the past month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards the peaks seen late in 2008. The trade-weighted index was about 7 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent higher, with a particularly large appreciation against the yen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket expectations for the outcome of this meeting were divided, but the most common\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview was for a 50 basis points cut in the cash rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was clear from the information that had become available over the past month that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe very sharp contraction in the global economy in the final quarter of 2008\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued during the first few months of this year.

Members noted, however, there was now considerable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic policy stimulus in place in most countries, which could be expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto support recovery over time. Tentative signs of improvement could be seen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some indicators for several countries, but it was too early yet to judge\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thow durable they would prove to be.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions and sentiment in global financial markets had continued to improve gradually\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month. The improvement, which had included a sizeable rally in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequity markets, had been helped by the announcements of more detailed plans\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a resolution of banking system difficulties in the United States and other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor countries. However, it would take time for the world financial system\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be restored to health. In the near term, the contraction in economic activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould affect the quality of assets on the books of financial institutions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, information over the past month had confirmed that the economy had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontracted in the December quarter, though the fall in GDP had been considerably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless than that of Australia's trading partners. Data for the March quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthus far suggested another weak outcome for demand and output, though members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that consumption had held up relatively well following the boost to spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate in 2008. Credit growth had slowed, with both reduced demand and tighter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending standards playing a role. The exception to this soft picture was credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor owner‑occupied housing, which had picked up owing to increased lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto first-home buyers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a consequence of the contraction in aggregate demand and output, capacity utilisation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued to decline and the demand for labour had weakened.

Inflation over the medium term was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to decline.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGiven this background, the question for the Board was whether there was a case for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional monetary easing. In discussing this question, members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had already been a major easing in both monetary and fiscal policy in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia in the past six months. Interest rates on loans to households and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany businesses were now at low levels by historical standards. The interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate reductions had lowered debt‑servicing burdens considerably, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor households. This stimulus, together with the substantial fiscal measures,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould support demand and help to foster economic recovery in due course. Nonetheless,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effect of recent international and domestic information had been that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnear-term outlook for demand and output in Australia was now weaker than earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected, though a recovery in demand was likely towards the end of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA period of low capacity utilisation and a weaker labour market was seen as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing the likelihood of a decline in inflation over the medium term.

Growth was, however, expected to be low for some time; the forecast growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor 2010 was 1.9 per cent, with a return to around trend rates of growth not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected until 2011.

There had been large declines in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth dwelling and business investment in the March quarter, but consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased by ½ per cent after sharp declines in the second half\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2008. The large falls in employment in recent months had led to a rise in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rate to 8½ per cent in March, although there were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsigns that the rate of deterioration in the labour market had stabilised. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that there were also other signs that the rate of contraction in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS economy had slowed, with the ISM surveys of business conditions in the manufacturing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand other sectors showing some improvement. It was also possible that the deterioration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the housing sector over the past three years was coming to an end, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing starts levelling out and some measures of housing prices showing small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases, after large declines.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOutput had fallen very sharply over the past year in the United Kingdom. Conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the manufacturing and housing sectors had been weak and the budget deficit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased significantly. However, there were some tentative signs of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing downturn coming to an end, with loan approvals picking up from very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow levels and housing prices showing some signs of bottoming.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic conditions in the euro area remained very weak.

Labour market conditions had deteriorated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly in Spain, where a substantial decline in construction activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas under way. The unemployment rate had also increased noticeably in Ireland.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to Asia, confidence among consumers and businesses in Japan remained very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow and industrial production was at the lowest level in 20 years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast, recent data in China had been much more positive. Output growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up in the March quarter, after a substantial slowing in the second half\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2008. Industrial production had also recorded a significant increase recently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor members, a key question was whether this was due to domestic demand, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe large public investment program, or a build-up in inventories.

The latest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tABS data on nationwide house prices showed a fall in the March quarter, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate-sector data for the same period had shown little change.

However, business conditions remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively weak, with many respondents noting that a lack of demand was a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestraint on output. A number of indicators suggested that the outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness investment was quite weak: imports of capital goods had declined sharply;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness surveys revealed that expectations for business investment were well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow average; and private non-residential building approvals had fallen sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the early part of 2009, though data released during the meeting suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta significant rise in the month of March. Members noted that despite significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls in investment expected in the current and following year, the level of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment as a share of GDP was not expected to decline to the levels seen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some previous downturns.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness credit had contracted in three of the past four months, though total business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt funding was not as weak, as some companies had accessed capital markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirectly. Members noted that both demand and supply factors were important;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses were looking to reduce debt, but it was also more difficult for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem to obtain funds in an environment in which lending standards were being\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightened.

For the advanced economies as a whole, budget deficits had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore quickly, and by a larger amount, than in previous downturns, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe synchronised nature of the current downturn and the significant discretionary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing of fiscal policy. Containing the build-up of public debt over the years\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead was likely to be a significant challenge for some countries, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven the ageing of the population and relatively slow growth in nominal income.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers concluded their discussion of the world economy by observing that, despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slightly more positive data for the world economy as a whole, a considerable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdegree of uncertainty regarding prospects for recovery remained. Growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be below trend for some time, and spare capacity and unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere expected to rise.

The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifference between the measures appeared to be unusually large.

These data showed that the level of spending was about 5 per cent higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan in November last year, with the recent fiscal stimulus packages a factor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin this growth. Liaison conducted by the staff indicated that retail conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been strong in May, partly reflecting the tax bonus payments in the second\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf of April and early May. Some retailers, however, held concerns about conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin June and beyond. Members noted that lower interest rates had also been important\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin improving aggregate household cash flow.

In addition, business expectations about future investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending were downgraded. However, in contrast to many other economies, investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a share of GDP was not expected to fall to unusually low levels, in large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart because of continuing high levels of investment in the mining sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness credit had fallen in the past few months, though other sources of funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been stronger, with significant equity raisings by large businesses.

Rural exports, notably wheat, had risen strongly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand there had been a smaller fall in manufacturing exports than that experienced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some other countries.

Immediately\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the results, a number of banks, including those that were not required\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto do so, undertook capital raisings, which were generally oversubscribed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank CDS spreads, particularly for US banks, declined sharply in the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter the announcement of the stress test results.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn addition to the US banks' capital raisings, there had also been sizeable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-guaranteed bank debt issuance at longer maturities, but spreads had varied\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquite widely. An ability to raise non-guaranteed debt was a precondition for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe repayment of TARP funds, which a number of financial institutions were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseeking to do as soon as they were allowed.

Recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation had not led to any downward revision to the outlook; if anything,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome indicators had been on the stronger side.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMonetary policy had been eased significantly, and budgetary measures were also providing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant support to demand.

Output in the major economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas likely to have contracted by a significantly smaller amount in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter than in the previous two quarters, while output in the developing countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof east Asia was likely to have recorded a substantial increase, underpinned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby a pick-up in growth in China. Consumer sentiment had recently risen somewhat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a range of countries, after earlier sharp falls, although it remained relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued. There were, as yet, few signs of a recovery in international trade,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the value of trade down around one-third from its peak in mid 2008, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlargest decline in many years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the recently released data for specific economies, members noted signs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the rate of deterioration in the United States had slowed and that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy may be reaching a turning point. Survey-based measures of business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had improved significantly, though production and labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata remained weak. Members also discussed the recent weakness in US consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespite strong growth in after-tax income, as many households sought to reduce\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleverage and consolidate their balance sheets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data on the Chinese economy had been positive, with all major components of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production recording gains over the past few months. An area of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotable strength was production of automobiles, where there were fiscal incentives\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto purchase new cars and light trucks. Other fiscal measures had led to a strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in public-sector investment, which had boosted the construction sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers expected that, over time, domestic demand was likely to play a more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant role in driving growth in the Chinese economy than had been the case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past couple of decades.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, recent data had been more encouraging than they had been for some time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been a slight rise in export volumes, after some very large falls,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand surveyed business conditions were up strongly, to close to average levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCorporate profits had, however, fallen sharply, to around the lowest level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the early 1980s, and measures of spare capacity were high.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn other parts of east Asia, conditions had also tended to improve. Data on exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed the effect of increased Chinese demand, with a number of countries recording\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased exports to China, but no recovery in exports to the developed countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe inventory cycle was expected to contribute to growth, after the subtractions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought on by the rapid de-stocking in the March quarter. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe improved information flows made possible by new technologies meant that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanies had responded very quickly to the synchronised global downturn in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand in the December quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been some improvement in business sentiment in Europe and the United Kingdom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past month or so, but the data on production and spending were still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, in contrast to the situation over the past year, international\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions were tending to revise up their growth forecasts for 2010. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge downside risks had abated. Nonetheless, the recovery was likely to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradual, reflecting the weakness of consumption in the developed countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas households saved more, as well as the effects of the stress in the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial system. Given this outlook, spare capacity was likely to accumulate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some time and unemployment in the advanced economies was likely to increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther. Members also observed that there had been a sharp decline in headline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation in the major developed economies and China and that the price level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen over the past year in some countries, though this largely reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in oil prices. Core inflation was still close to 2 per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe developed economies, but was generally expected to decline over the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe GDP outcome for the March quarter had been surprisingly strong. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unusually large difference between the various measures of GDP. If the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult was combined with the December quarter outcome, the picture was that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy had contracted slightly over the six months to March. This seemed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly consistent with other indicators.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted Australia's remarkably strong export performance over the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand March quarters. Over this period, export volumes had increased by almost\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 per cent, whereas in other countries, export volumes had typically fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby 10–20 per cent, with much larger falls being recorded in some cases.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the depreciation of the Australian dollar had been helpful to exporters,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strong performance of the Chinese economy was particularly important. Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports of both iron ore and coal had recently rebounded after earlier large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at consumption, members noted that retail sales had increased strongly in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMay and were 7 per cent higher than in September, a considerably stronger outcome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan in comparable countries. The staff's liaison with retailers suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this strength had continued into June. Members noted that the fiscal transfers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad helped support retail sales, as had the stimulus for indebted households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom lower interest rates. The effect of the fiscal transfers was also clearly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparent in the data on credit card repayments, which had increased around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe time that these transfers were made. Consumer confidence had risen strongly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the business sector, investment had fallen by 6 per cent in the March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, which was nonetheless stronger than the outcome in many other countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile members noted that further falls in investment were likely, business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentiment had improved recently. Members also noted that car sales to businesses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased significantly over the past couple of months, stimulated by tax\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincentives, notably for small businesses. They also discussed recent trends\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin business funding, noting that while business credit had fallen over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths, this decline was accounted for by borrowings in foreign currency, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere likely to be funding offshore operations. While credit conditions had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightened for many borrowers, recently there had been some large corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond raisings and a large increase in issuance of equity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers considered recent trends in the housing market. The staff's liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand data on first-home owner grants and housing lending suggested that some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in housing construction was likely over the second half of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, members noted that recent building approvals for medium-density dwellings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been weak, particularly outside the capital cities, partly reflecting reduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand for holiday apartments, but also the tighter lending standards applying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto property projects generally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers also noted that, according to a range of private-sector measures monitored\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the staff, house prices had increased in almost all areas over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAuction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne were also high, though the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of sales by auction was not particularly high. Housing loan approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere strong, and while existing borrowers had increased their loan repayments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverall housing credit had recorded solid growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there had been a small fall in employment in May and that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had risen to 5.7 per cent. Although there had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnet change in employment over the past six months, there had been a large fall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin hours worked. This reflected a shift in composition from full-time to part-time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment, as well as efforts by firms to preserve jobs by reducing working\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thours. Employment indicators from business surveys had recently been more positive,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut job advertisements had fallen in June.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been no new major data on prices and wages since the previous meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that consumers' inflation expectations had increased slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter falling sharply over the past year. The June quarter CPI was scheduled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor release prior to the next meeting, at which time a revised set of forecasts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be provided to the Board.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the conditions in financial markets had been mixed during the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth.

The European Central Bank had injected liquidity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the banking system through a one-year repurchase agreement at a fixed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate of 1 per cent, which had prompted a fall in short-term rates of more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan 30 basis points in the euro area. Elsewhere in Europe, central bank policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taction had seen short-term rates fall by about 25 basis points in Sweden,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the Swiss National Bank had injected liquidity through its intervention\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto restrict the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, following stronger-than-expected employment data for May, financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had begun to price in a commencement of the monetary policy tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcycle by year end. Over the course of the month, however, the expected start\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the tightening cycle was pushed back, with market pricing now placing it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the end of the first quarter next year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that conditions in money markets around the world had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timprove, with spreads now at the levels prevailing prior to the collapse of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLehman Brothers. In Australia, short-term money market spreads were now around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe lowest levels in the period since the onset of the financial crisis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe improvement in conditions had allowed the Bank to reduce the size of its balance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheet, after the sharp expansion earlier in the financial year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBond yields in Australia had tended to rise a little more than in other countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand there had been a significant amount of issuance by banks and the State\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernments in recent weeks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal guaranteed bond issuance had slowed over the past few months as credit markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad improved.

Overall bond issuance had been at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta high level in Europe, where there had also been a rise in the proportion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof unguaranteed debt being offered.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian banks had raised a considerable amount of funds through bond issuance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had continued to make relatively heavy use of the guarantee arrangements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had already been significant issuance in the early part of July. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the Australian banks had continued to compete strongly for deposit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflows and were lengthening their debt maturity profiles.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn signs of improving credit market conditions, US corporate bond issuance had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh in the past two months across the rating spectrum. Corporates were accessing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit markets directly, in part because of the limited credit extension offered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby banks at present.

There had been very strong equity raising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin aggregate in the past few months, as companies continued to reduce borrowings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin an effort to lower their gearing ratios. Members noted that the strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof equity raising implied that total business funding had expanded, notwithstanding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe decline in intermediated finance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had been mixed across major trading partners'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrencies over the month.

Other east Asian economies (excluding Japan) had regained around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo-thirds of earlier falls and production in Japan had also increased. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the recovery in Asian industrial production was positive for Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough industrial production was still very weak in the United States and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe euro area.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese GDP growth had surprised on the upside in the June quarter, reflecting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects of significant monetary and fiscal stimulus.

Housing prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere also increasing again. Members also discussed the very strong growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in China, especially in the central and western provinces, noting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there were some reasons to expect that high levels of investment could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue for some time yet.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had also been an improvement in conditions in the higher-income economies in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsia. GDP growth in Korea had been strong in the June quarter, partly reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in household consumption, which had been boosted by temporary fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures such as the incentives for the purchase of cars. June quarter GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata were not yet available for Japan, but industrial production showed a strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up after very large falls in late 2008 and early 2009. This pick-up was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost noticeable in consumer durables, which had earlier seen the largest falls:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis partly reflected government incentives to buy cars and energy-efficient\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappliances.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, output had again fallen in the June quarter, but by less than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the previous two quarters.

The outlook for the housing sector had improved, with measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof house prices no longer falling, and house sales and building starts showing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall increases recently. In contrast, members noted that conditions in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommercial property market were still looking weak and that the impact of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker economy had not yet been fully reflected in banks' asset portfolios.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the United Kingdom had been weak, with another significant decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin output in the June quarter, although the decline was smaller than in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember and March quarters.

Business surveys\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued to strengthen and consumer sentiment had risen sharply over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast two months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail spending had been strong in the first part of the June quarter, which had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen reflected in a 2 per cent increase in real spending in the quarter, according\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto data that became available during the meeting. Members discussed the likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdurability of this strength, noting that data for the month of June had showed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta reversal of some of the earlier gains, and staff liaison with retailers suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat spending in July might be weaker than in earlier months. Members also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted, however, that there had been a significant increase in household wealth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince March, reversing a considerable share of the earlier decline.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing loan approvals had strengthened considerably in the first five months of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year, especially for first-home buyers. Members noted that this increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand had contributed to an increase in housing prices. Private-sector price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures had strengthened further in June, and the ABS data showed a very strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in the June quarter after being relatively weak in the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent strength in housing prices was fairly widespread, including in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher-priced suburbs, where repeat buyers predominate. Members observed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strength in housing prices also reflected other factors, including low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmortgage rates, strong population growth and inelastic supply. They noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommencements in recent years had been below estimates of underlying demand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent, albeit moderate, growth in building approvals for houses was positive,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough approvals for apartments remained weak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed some of the factors influencing the business sector. There had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen some recent strength in spending on some forms of equipment, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmotor vehicles. This had reflected the temporary tax allowances on such assets,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand members expected that this boost would fade. Approvals for private non-residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction had remained weak in the first half of the year, after falling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly during the second half of 2008. This weakness was in part due\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the sharp turnaround in conditions in the office property sector, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital values had fallen significantly and vacancy rates were rising. Overall,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness investment was expected to fall significantly as a share of GDP over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2009 and 2010, but it would still remain quite high by historical standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPartly offsetting this weakness, there was likely to be a pick-up in public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment spending, with the public building approvals data for June showing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta very large increase, as the Australian Government initiatives on education\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending began to take effect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed trends in business financing. They noted that while business credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen over the first half of this year, businesses had raised significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds from capital and equity markets. Within bank credit, the decline in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst half of this year had been in lending to corporates. Credit to unincorporated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenterprises had declined in the second half of 2008, but had grown in 2009\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto date. Members noted, however, that the terms and conditions of lending had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttypically been tightened significantly relative to pre-crisis levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market data for June showed a fall in employment and a modest increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rate. The fall in aggregate employment in this downturn had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen quite small, though the data for hours worked had showed a larger decline.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, the deterioration in the labour market had recently been less than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected earlier in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCPI inflation had slowed to 1.5 per cent over the year to the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe decline in measures of underlying inflation had been more gradual, to around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0.8 per cent in the quarter and 3¾ per cent over the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unusually large gap between the CPI and underlying inflation was mostly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounted for by the large fall in petrol prices around the turn of the year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the estimated fall in the price of deposit and loan facilities used by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the revised staff forecasts prepared for the meeting. The central\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast for GDP through 2009 had been revised from a decline of 1 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a rise of ½ per cent. About half of this revision reflected the stronger-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP data for the March quarter. It was noted that the wide discrepancy in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious estimates of GDP suggested that this figure was subject to greater-than-usual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty. More generally, the upward revision to the forecast reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta view that exports, business investment, household consumption and dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment would all be stronger than earlier expected. The outlook for 2010\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas also slightly stronger. Members noted that it was still unclear how much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the greater-than-expected recent buoyancy in the economy might have been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdue to the temporary effects of earlier fiscal stimulus. Overall, however,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey concurred that the economic outlook had improved.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe central forecast for underlying inflation was broadly unchanged in the near term,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut the upward revision to the growth outlook meant that the trough in inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas unlikely to be as low as had been previously expected. The staff forecasts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow suggested that underlying inflation would fall to about 2 per cent around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2010 and early 2011.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been a material improvement in conditions in financial markets over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month, especially in the two weeks leading up to the meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInternationally, spreads in money markets had continued to fall and were now clearly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the levels that had prevailed shortly before the collapse of Lehman Brothers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlast September. In the case of Australia, the bank bills to OIS spread was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat its lowest level since the onset of the crisis in mid 2007.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpreads on government-guaranteed issuance had also tended to narrow. The amount of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment-guaranteed issuance globally was also falling. Australian banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere increasing their issuance of unguaranteed debt, including in offshore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, though they had continued to issue sizeable amounts of guaranteed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted developments in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Usage of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe shorter-term emergency liquidity facilities had fallen, but the Fed had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to buy Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. These purchases had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelped to reduce mortgage yields. Overall, the size of the Fed's balance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheet had not changed much since the start of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the case of the Reserve Bank, however, all of last year's expansion in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbalance sheet had now been reversed, which was another sign of the normalisation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Australian markets. Exchange settlement balances had been reduced to a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover $1 billion, which was only marginally higher than their pre-crisis levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the general improvement in financial markets had also been reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin increases of around 10 per cent in global equity prices over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEquity prices had now risen by around 40 per cent from the lows earlier this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear. The market had been bolstered by earnings reports from a number of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge global banks, which had benefited from strong earnings from investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanking activities; profits from commercial banking activities were more restrained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been larger recoveries in emerging equity markets, notably in China,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere prices had doubled from earlier lows.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian share market had increased broadly in line with markets in other developed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. Resource shares had risen especially strongly since the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard meeting, consistent with the rise in commodity prices. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat equity raisings had been particularly strong recently, amounting to 7\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent of market capitalisation over the past year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn currency markets, the US dollar had tended to depreciate over the past month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile the Australian dollar had continued to appreciate, to be at its highest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels since September 2008. It had reversed around two-thirds of the decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the peak levels in July last year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the basis of the available information, members judged that financial markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad improved substantially and that the global economic outlook was also better.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOutput was stabilising in the advanced economies and recovering quite strongly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Asia. Forecasts for global growth, while still low, were being raised for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first time in a year.

Domestic demand had also been stronger than expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough some of the recent strength in the domestic economy might be temporary,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly reflecting policy measures, the outlook for domestic spending had improved,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven the significant recovery in measures of household and business confidence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, the staff had revised their growth forecasts upwards. The revised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts were still for sluggish output performance in the near term, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tembodied a strengthening of growth during 2010 and 2011. The latest CPI inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfigures showed that inflation had fallen in underlying terms as expected and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther declines were still anticipated. The recent appreciation of the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate would dampen the effects coming from the earlier depreciation, as well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas dampening activity at the margin. But the upward revision to the growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts meant that inflation was not expected to fall as low as previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the cash rate had been reduced to the current very low level in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipation of very weak economic outcomes. In recent months, members had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft open the possibility of further reductions in the cash rate should further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdownside risks to the economy emerge. Given the recent improvement in the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand domestic outlooks, it now appeared unlikely that this would be necessary.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, if the economy evolved as anticipated in the forecasts, the Bank would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin due course need to adopt a less expansionary policy stance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn discussing the timing and process of removing some of the current expansionary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy setting, members noted that it would, when it began, involve balancing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo risks. There was a risk of overstaying a very accommodative setting in a recovering\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy, particularly when underlying inflation still needed to decline to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treach the target. On the other hand, there was a risk of an early tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoking off confidence and demand prematurely. A particular source of uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas whether the recent growth in household spending was due mainly to the temporary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal measures, in which case it would probably soon fade, a more general\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in risk aversion, or the more persistent effects of lower interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates.

Data for June quarter GDP were now available for most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies and showed that growth in the Asian region had been much stronger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan elsewhere. However, there had been some upside surprises in other countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding positive growth in France and Germany in the quarter. Industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction in a number of countries had been boosted by incentives for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurchase of cars and other durable goods. There was therefore a question about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sustainability of the recovery, in particular whether the growth that had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen seen was largely a one-off effect of stimulus measures or if there was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso a fundamental improvement.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the divergence that was being seen in different parts of the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy.

India\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad recorded two quarters of solid growth in the first half of 2009, boosted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby an easing of both fiscal and monetary policy. In South Korea, industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction had grown by nearly 30 per cent since the start of the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was now back to its previous peak. There had been a particularly strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecovery in production of electronic components, some of which were exported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto China for assembly. The Japanese economy was also doing better than earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected, though part of the growth in the June quarter was accounted for by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures to boost sales of cars and household appliances. Nevertheless, there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a significant amount of spare capacity, with Japanese output 7½ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent below its peak and the unemployment rate, at 5.7 per cent in July, at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe highest level in the five decades for which there were comparable data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe data for the United States indicated that the pace of deterioration in the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket was easing.

The US economy was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to grow in the September quarter, after contracting by 4 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the previous year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on global trends in credit growth and housing markets. Developments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin business credit had been fairly similar across countries, with falls in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2009 in a number of advanced economies as companies reduced debt levels in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan environment of tighter credit standards by lenders. In relation to housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, members observed that in countries that had experienced better economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutcomes and/or fewer financial sector problems (e.g. China, Canada, Norway\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Australia), house prices now appeared to be rising quite solidly and were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove or around earlier peaks. Even in the US and UK, which had earlier experienced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant falls in house prices, there had been some up-ticks recently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe flow of information on the Australian economy over the past month had been mostly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositive. The staff's expectation was that GDP data for the June quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdue to be released the day after the meeting, would show a moderate increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin output, with growth in household consumption, business investment, public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending and exports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeasures of sentiment had continued to strengthen.

The data for business investment in the June quarter indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta strong rise in spending on plant and equipment, with a sharp increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending on a wide range of capital goods, including cars. However, this mostly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected the bringing forward of spending to qualify for tax allowances. Car\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales had subsequently fallen in July. Building construction had fallen sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter, but engineering construction had risen strongly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the broader outlook for investment, which – as a share of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP – was around the highest levels in the 50-year history of the national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounts. The capital expenditure survey pointed to some near-term weakness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin private investment, though less than expected earlier in the year. Developments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the resources sector, especially for LNG, pointed to significant strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the medium term. Public investment would increase because of the fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulus packages and state government infrastructure plans. Members also discussed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe trend in dwelling investment. They noted that even though the number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew dwellings completed had been lower in recent years, dwelling investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a share of GDP had held up, due to the trend towards larger and higher-quality\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thomes and an increase in the share of alterations and additions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness credit data showed a further fall in July, but there were some tentative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsigns of a slowing in the rate of decline. Equity raisings had remained strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe most recent profits data showed a pick-up in the non-mining sector in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune quarter, but mining profits had declined following earlier falls in commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe data for June quarter export volumes showed most categories were growing or holding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup reasonably well. Manufacturing exports were the exception, and had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly in line with the falls seen in many other countries. On average, commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had been broadly steady since the last meeting. Iron ore spot prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad weakened over the previous couple of weeks, although they remained above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe contract prices agreed with Japanese and Korean steel mills.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe most recent monthly labour market data continued to suggest that the deterioration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the numbers employed and in unemployment had been less than feared earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year. There had been a noticeable increase in flexibility in hours worked.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that this had been beneficial for firms, employees and the broader\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe wage price index showed a significant moderation in private-sector wage growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the first half of the year, although public-sector wage growth had not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowed much. The slowing in private-sector wage growth was consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treports that some companies had implemented wage freezes, and members judged\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it would be helpful in minimising job losses and in exerting some downward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure on underlying inflation from the current elevated levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSentiment in financial markets had generally consolidated further over the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpreads in money markets had narrowed further, gradually returning towards more normal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels.

Members noted that recent guaranteed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuance in the Australian market had mostly been by branches and subsidiaries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof foreign banks. The major banks had raised some longer-term offshore unguaranteed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt at a yield that was only slightly above the all-in cost of a guaranteed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissue.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were some favourable signs in the Australian residential mortgage-backed securities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket. The gap between secondary market yields and primary market yields was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinuing to close, such that the prospect of issuance without the support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Australian Office of Financial Management was increasing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEquity markets had mostly strengthened over the past month, with China a notable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texception. Chinese equities had fallen significantly from their recent peak,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith concerns over the rapid credit expansion and its possible curtailment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributing to significant volatility, which had spilt over to other markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton occasion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian equity market had risen, especially financial sector stocks. Although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderlying profits of Australian companies had fallen significantly, recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearnings reports had mostly met or exceeded analyst expectations.

Together with an increase in term interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates, which were rising because of expectations of monetary tightening, this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas contributing to an increase in bank funding costs. Banks had raised interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates on their fixed-rate lending and members noted there was market speculation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat variable mortgage rates might also be increased. Average business lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates had risen slightly, as banks continued to adjust customer risk margins\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupwards as loan facilities were renewed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial System": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem. The discussion focused on the improvement in conditions in the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial sector over the past six months; the resilience of the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial system; improvements in sentiment among Australian households and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses; and developments in regulation of the financial sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the extreme risk aversion prevailing in global markets in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twake of the Lehman Brothers collapse last year had dissipated. Investors had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecome more confident, which was evident in a bounce-back in global equity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices. The recovery in share prices had been proportionately larger for banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan the broader equity market. There had been similarities in the performance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Australian equity market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that financial conditions in some key countries remained challenging,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas macroeconomic conditions continued to weigh on loan quality.

Although loan impairments were rising, mainly relating to business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending, the large Australian banks had reported solid profits for the latest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf-year, as they had throughout the period of the financial crisis. The banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained well capitalised, and had strengthened their positions further with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional raisings during the past year. With investor risk appetite returning,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks had been increasingly willing to tap markets on their own credit standing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand without the support of the government guarantee in the past couple of months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed overall lending standards, which had clearly tightened since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstart of the crisis. They noted that while larger companies had been reducing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt and banks had reduced exposures, credit remained available to high-quality\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowers, albeit at higher spreads. Although commercial property was currently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe largest component of non-performing assets, the construction cycle had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot been as pronounced as in the late 1980s. This suggested that there was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta smaller amount of overbuilding in the market, including in Perth and Brisbane,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere the largest falls in commercial capital values had been seen to date.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the non-financial sector, members noted that sentiment among Australian households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand businesses had improved significantly. Many firms were still trying to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthen their balance sheets by reducing debt and raising equity. For households,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnet worth had fallen during the past year but the latest figures showed it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now recovering, reflecting higher prices for both shares and houses. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved that household interest payments as a share of disposable income had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen substantially and that household borrowing was growing at a moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn regulatory developments, members noted the ongoing debate in various international\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfora. Details on possible changes to regulations covering bank capital and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother standards were still being worked out, but were likely to result in higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital and liquidity requirements around the world.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe information presented to members showed that the situation in the global economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas continuing to improve. Of most significance to Australia, the Asian region\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad recorded strong growth in the June quarter. While this had been largely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriven by domestic demand in these economies, reflecting strong economic stimulus,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were also recent signs of a pick-up in their exports. Outside Asia, most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies had experienced another fall in GDP in the June quarter, though more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent information suggested that the majority of these economies were now\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproaching a turning point.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn important question for members was whether the global economic improvement would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe sustained, or whether it was mainly a reflection of the strong macroeconomic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulus that had been applied over the past year and might in due course fade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were also conscious that, even though financial market conditions had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timproved significantly and debt markets were beginning to function again, banks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporates and households in many countries still faced significant balance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheet adjustments. This too could serve to limit growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers concluded on balance that the global economy was most likely on a sustained,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif modest, recovery path, though it was still too soon to be confident of this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassessment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that indicators of the domestic economy over the past month had again\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen better than expected. GDP figures due to be published the next day would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost likely show that a moderate rise in output had occurred in the June quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich meant that the slowdown in GDP had been significantly less than forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier in the year. Consumption, investment and exports had all shown unexpected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresilience. Measures of confidence of both households and businesses had recovered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that it was hard to disentangle the contribution that Asian demand,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal stimulus and easier monetary policy had each made to the better-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutcomes. There were signs that some of the unexpected strength in investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter owed to the pull-forward of spending to qualify for tax\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcessions that ended in June, but investment plans for the year ahead had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso been revised up. Information from liaison suggested that household spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight be holding up reasonably well even several months after the government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpayments had ended. There were some signs that Chinese demand for resources\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not continued at the exceptional pace of the June quarter, but liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith resources companies suggested that they were very confident about medium-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprospects.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers also noted that business credit was still very weak and that borrowers were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfacing tight credit conditions and rising borrowing costs as banks continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto review risk margins as lending facilities were renewed. For some sectors,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly those related to property, this was likely to continue to be a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrake on economic activity in the near term. The rise in market yields, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectation of a monetary tightening, was also adding to borrowing costs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were reassured by the clear signs of wage moderation in the economy, as this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould help to contain inflation in the near term. Nonetheless, with underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation still relatively high on the latest reading and economic activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstantially stronger than expected, members were conscious of the need to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbalance the task of controlling inflation over the medium term with that of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupporting economic recovery.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt the previous meeting, members had agreed that if the economy continued to evolve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas in the latest forecasts, the Bank would in due course need to adopt a less\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpansionary policy stance. The information at this meeting suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic conditions were indeed evolving broadly in that way.

Global forecasts had been revised up,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the recent IMF forecasts showing a modest upward revision for 2009 and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta significant upward revision for 2010. World growth in 2010 (based on purchasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower parity weights) was now forecast at 3.1 per cent, up from 1.9 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent in April.

The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinventory cycle was also contributing temporarily to growth in a number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries. Where that had occurred, a durable recovery would require sustained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in private demand.

The major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks' issuance in the local market was entirely unguaranteed, but they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad issued both guaranteed and unguaranteed paper offshore. The foreign-owned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks operating in Australia had continued to issue a sizeable volume of guaranteed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaper. These changing issuance patterns had reflected pricing incentives, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit now being cheaper for the major banks to issue unguaranteed bonds domestically\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan guaranteed bonds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in Australian securitised markets had improved noticeably in the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth; for the first time in a year, there was a successful issue of residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) without the support of the AOFM.

The recovery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the advanced economies was relatively subdued, and was expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso owing to on-going balance sheet adjustments following the past couple of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears of financial difficulties. The Asian economies, on the other hand, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up strongly over the past six months and the outlook was quite positive.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, growth in Australia's major trading partners over the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod was expected to be relatively close to trend.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the domestic economy had for some time been noticeably stronger than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad earlier been expected. Growth forecasts were tending to be revised up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeasures of both household and business confidence had recovered, household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending had remained relatively resilient, house-building activity was in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe process of picking up and the risks of a sharp contraction in business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had receded noticeably. The impact of public-sector spending on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure was starting to become apparent. Absent further setbacks, GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth could be close to trend through 2010. Inflation was likely to decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the near term but probably not fall as far as earlier expected. At its previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo meetings, the Board had noted the improvement in the economy and had agreed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, if prospects for the economy continued to strengthen, in due course there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be a need to adopt a less expansionary policy stance. The question facing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Board was whether the continued picture of improving conditions and prospects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month meant that the point had now been reached where the cash\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate should be increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the risks that a move at this meeting would be premature. Key among\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem was that economic prospects for most of the developed world were still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertain and the possibility of another downturn in some countries could not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe ruled out. While such an outcome would no doubt be detrimental to confidence,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding in Australia, members noted that prospects for Australia were being\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffected significantly by developments in the Asian region, which was doing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively well despite weakness in the advanced economies. Members also noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a sizeable gap had opened up between the performance of Australia and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother developed economies, and the Board had to be mindful of local conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin setting policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there was still a possibility that the recent strength in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic economy had been largely due to the greater-than-expected impact of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fiscal stimulus, which left open the attendant risk that activity might\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslow as that stimulus faded. It was also likely that the appreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate would act as a contractionary influence on activity and help\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontain inflation. These considerations weighed in favour of keeping the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy setting for a while longer so as to evaluate further data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, members judged that, compared with previous meetings, the risks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin waiting had increased. In particular, underlying inflation was still, on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latest data, above the target and, while current forecasts suggested it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould fall in the coming year, the expected trough in inflation was significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher than earlier thought. Keeping interest rates at very low levels for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan extended period could therefore threaten the achievement of the inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget over the medium term. More generally, very expansionary policy could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult in the build-up of other imbalances in the economy, which would ultimately\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe detrimental to economic growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, members concluded that, while downside risks to the domestic economy could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be ruled out, they had diminished significantly over recent months.

CPI inflation had been 1 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent in the September quarter and 1.3 per cent over the year, with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow annual outcome reflecting earlier falls in petrol prices and in the ABS\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testimate of the prices of deposit and loan facilities. There had been strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in prices in the housing component of the CPI, especially in electricity,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater and gas prices. Food prices had fallen for the second consecutive quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter earlier strong increases. The staff's assessment was that underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation had been around 0.8 per cent in the quarter and 3½ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the year, down from a peak of a little over 4½ per cent a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear earlier. This was broadly in line with expectations that price pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould gradually decline, reflecting the earlier slowing in the economy, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing in wage growth and the higher exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe staff forecasts were broadly similar to those discussed at the previous meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe outlook for commodity prices and the terms of trade had strengthened over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months, and market expectations were for increases in the contract prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof coal and iron ore in 2010.

The Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOffice of Financial Management had taken up around 40 per cent of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissues, a considerably smaller proportion than earlier in the year; this indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther improvement in the securitisation market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the banking sector, there remained a divergence between the relatively weak performance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof many of the large international banks and the Australian banks that had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently reported half-year earnings. Among international banks, there had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen a continuation of the pattern of stronger earnings from banks with larger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment banking operations.

Strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition for deposits, partly reflecting a desire by banks to reduce their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treliance on short-term capital market funding, had pushed up interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton deposits relative to other funding sources.

Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that this represented some further upward revision to forecasts of some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths earlier, which had suggested inflation might fall below the target for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been a relatively limited amount of new data on real activity in the economy;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe September labour force data had provided further evidence that the downturn\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the labour market had been more moderate than expected earlier in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking ahead, the outlook was for the growth rate of output to rise gradually\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a pace close to trend in 2010.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, members considered that the recent information was consistent with the conclusions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treached by the Board a month earlier: namely, conditions in the global and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian economies were significantly better than had been expected earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year when the Board had lowered the cash rate to 3 per cent; the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian economy was operating with less spare capacity than earlier thought\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely; and the growth outlook for the next few years had improved.

There had been a broad-based pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin surveyed conditions in manufacturing across economies as well as in growth in industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction and merchandise trade. GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little over recent quarters and forecasts for 2017 and 2018 had been revised a little higher,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly because of expectations of expansionary fiscal policy in the United States. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrading partner growth was still expected to ease slightly towards the end of the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, reflecting a projected slowing in growth in China in the medium term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that inflation in the advanced economies had continued to increase recently,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainly as a result of higher oil prices.

These developments and a decline in spare capacity were expected to flow through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto higher core inflation in the advanced economies over time.

These outcomes had led to more confidence that Chinese growth would remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresilient in 2017. A range of policy measures had contributed to an increase in residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment. There had been growth in residential property investment across a range of Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities in the second half of 2016, which had led to a pick-up in demand for construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaterials and growth in industrial sector output. Total social financing had increased at almost\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble the pace of GDP over 2016. This had supported the economy in the near term, but implied a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther rise in China's debt-to-income ratio, which heightened the risks to Chinese growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe medium term.

As a result of these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity price developments, Australia's terms of trade had increased significantly and by more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan had been expected. Although the rise in the terms of trade had been larger and lasted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger than expected, members noted that the stimulus for additional mining investment was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be limited and some of the higher income would accrue to foreign owners. The terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade were expected to decline over the forecast period, but to remain above their lows of early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2016. Nevertheless, the higher terms of trade represented a boost to national income, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovided some upside risks to the domestic forecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers started their discussion of the domestic economy by noting the outcome for GDP growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe September quarter. The 0.5 per cent decline in real GDP in the quarter was considerably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker than had been expected, reflecting some temporary factors, including disruptions to coal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply and bad weather. Slower growth in consumption had also been a factor. This weakness was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot expected to have continued into the December quarter and the forecasts for quarterly GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth were little changed. GDP growth was expected to pick up to around 3 per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended terms later in 2017, and to remain above estimates of potential growth over the rest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough export volumes had been unexpectedly weak in the September quarter because of supply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisruptions, growth in resource exports had subsequently increased. Members noted that Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad recorded a significant trade surplus in the December quarter. Over the forecast period,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia's low-cost producers of iron ore were expected to increase output further and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tramp-up in liquefied natural gas production was expected to make a significant contribution to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutput growth. The drag on growth from falling mining investment was also expected to diminish.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-mining business investment had increased by around 5 per cent over the year to the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Growth in non-mining business investment had been strongest in New South Wales and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVictoria over recent years, where economic conditions had been most favourable. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential building construction was likely to remain subdued in coming quarters, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in approvals over the past year across a range of sectors suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential building construction would contribute to GDP growth towards the latter part of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousehold consumption growth had been subdued in the June and September quarters of 2016,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with subdued growth in household income. More recently, growth in retail sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolumes for the December quarter had increased, households' perceptions of their personal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinances had remained around average and expectations of unemployment had been low relative to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent years. Subdued growth in household income was likely to constrain consumption growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the forecasts for consumption growth were closely related to labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments and households' expectations about their income growth. Employment had risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmodestly in the December quarter and all of the increase had been in the full-time component,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treversing the pattern of the previous few quarters. Forward-looking indicators had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with some pick-up in employment growth over the period ahead. The unemployment rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased slightly in late 2016 to 5.8 per cent and was expected to edge only slightly lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOngoing spare capacity in the labour market had contributed to subdued wage pressures, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were some indications that wage growth had reached a trough. Growth in wages and household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome were expected to increase gradually. Members observed that any increase in uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat households have about their future income growth could lead to lower consumption growth,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly for those households servicing sizeable debts. In contrast, if households were to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecome more positive about their future employment, income or wealth, then consumption growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould be stronger than suggested by the forecast. Similarly, stronger actual income growth would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso tend to lead to stronger consumption growth than forecast.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivate dwelling investment had declined unexpectedly in the September quarter, largely because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoor weather had disrupted construction. However, dwelling investment had grown at an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove-average rate over the previous year, supported by low interest rates and further increases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin housing prices. The large amount of work in the pipeline was expected to support dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment at high levels over the next year or so, although there was some risk of more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcancellations than usual if conditions in apartment markets deteriorated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe combination of increased supply and lower population growth had already depressed rents and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapartment prices in Perth and, increasingly, Brisbane. In contrast, conditions in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testablished housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had strengthened over the second half of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2016 and investor housing loan approvals had risen over recent months. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing market activity in Melbourne and surrounding areas had been supported by strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation growth and improvements in transportation infrastructure.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLow wage growth and rent inflation had contributed to another low inflation outcome in December.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderlying and headline inflation had both been around 1½ per cent over 2016, in line with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts presented in the November <em>Statement on Monetary Policy</em>. Petrol prices had risen in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, after subtracting from inflation over much of the previous few years. Higher tobacco\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had made a significant contribution to headline inflation over the year, and were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to continue to do so given the further increases in tobacco excise that are scheduled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next four years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were signs that non-tradables inflation had stabilised over recent quarters, after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclining for a number of years. Prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items) had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined in the December quarter and over the year. The earlier depreciation of the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate was no longer estimated to be putting upward pressure on tradables prices. Heightened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetitive pressures in some product markets from the entrance of new competitors had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributed to low inflation. While the impact of these pressures was expected to wane over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, the point at which this might occur was uncertain.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been very little change to the forecast for inflation. Underlying inflation was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to pick up gradually, largely because unit labour costs were expected to rise gradually\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand spare capacity in the economy was expected to diminish. However, members noted that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfactors that had weighed on inflationary pressures could be more persistent than had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassumed. On the other hand, wage growth could rise more quickly than forecast if labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were to improve by more than expected, particularly if employees were to demand wage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases to compensate for the period of low wage growth over recent years. Members also noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the recent pick-up in global inflationary pressures could flow through to domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation by more than expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion by observing that the US election result had driven\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in financial markets over the past two months.

Growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade had picked up further and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvey measures of business conditions had remained at high levels. Headline inflation in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor advanced economies had increased noticeably in recent months, largely as a result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher oil prices, to be close to most central banks' targets.

This suggested that the authorities would continue to use policy to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport near-term growth. However, policymakers had also increased their focus on addressing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks to longer-term growth. The People's Bank of China had signalled a reduction in monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulus, reflecting concerns about rising financial stability risks, and the target for growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin total social financing had been lowered slightly to 12 per cent.

Fiscal policy was also expected to be expansionary under the new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadministration and the US economy was expected to grow above its potential rate in 2017.

Members noted that the increase in global trade over the second half of 2016 had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderpinned by an improvement in global economic conditions, both for Australia's major trading\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartners and other parts of the world that were important sources of external demand for output\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom East Asia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia's terms of trade had risen by around 15 per cent over the second half of 2016 and were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to rise again in the March quarter. In February, prices for iron ore, base metals and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrude oil had all reached their highest level in more than a year, although the price of coking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoal had fallen from its peak in November. Some reversal in the terms of trade was still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected, although the recent improvement in global demand suggested that higher commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices could be more persistent than previously anticipated. Members noted that generalised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength in commodity prices tended to indicate an improvement in global demand conditions, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat factors affecting the supply of commodities had also affected prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth in the December quarter of 1.1 per cent had been above expectations. The outcome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly reflected the reversal of some of the temporary factors that had contributed to the fall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin output in the September quarter. Most notably, there had been a solid pick-up in export\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in the December quarter; in addition, growth in both consumption and business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been higher than expected. Total nominal income had risen strongly, driven by growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmining sector profits as a result of the higher terms of trade; in contrast, growth in labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincomes had been unusually weak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe mining sector had contributed to growth in the December quarter, reflecting higher exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand an unexpected increase in investment. Members observed that some resource firms may have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen able to increase their exports to take advantage of higher commodity prices by running down\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinventories. Consistent with previous staff forecasts, the capital expenditure survey of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment intentions continued to indicate that mining investment would fall further over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing year or so, but that the drag on growth would dissipate over this period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-mining business investment had risen in the December quarter, largely as a result of higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential construction, although machinery and equipment investment had also risen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-mining business investment had picked up over the previous two years or so and business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had been more positive in recent months. In contrast to these more positive signs,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-residential building approvals had declined further and the capital expenditure survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to suggest that, in aggregate, firms do not intend to increase their spending on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining investment over the following year or so. Members observed, however, that this survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes not cover some important sectors, including education and health, and also does not include\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in intellectual property, which has become an increasingly important share of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining business investment in the national accounts measure. Members noted that in most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors there had been little evidence that non-mining business investment had been held back by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlack of access to credit.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment had rebounded in the December quarter; much of the strength had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcentrated in New South Wales. Even though building approvals had fallen significantly in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months, the substantial amount of building work in the pipeline suggested that dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment would continue to contribute to growth in coming quarters. Conditions in established\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing markets had continued to differ significantly across the country. Over recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions appeared to have strengthened in Sydney and had remained strong in Melbourne; these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities had continued to record brisk growth in housing prices, and auction clearance rates had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained high. Housing loan approvals and credit growth had picked up for investors, primarily\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin New South Wales and Victoria. In contrast, housing prices and rents had fallen in Perth for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo years or so, and apartment prices had declined in Brisbane.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRural exports had grown strongly in the December quarter, reflecting strong farm production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing favourable weather conditions in many areas over the second half of 2016. As a result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this and the higher prices for bulk commodity exports, there had been a trade surplus in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter for the first time in almost three years. The current account deficit had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnarrowed to less than 1 per cent of GDP, the smallest deficit since 1980; the trade surplus was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly offset by a widening in the net income deficit as some of the increase in mining profits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad accrued to foreign owners.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousehold consumption growth, which had been relatively subdued in mid 2016, picked up in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter, consistent with retail sales. Liaison with retailers suggested that recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrading conditions had been around average and household perceptions of their personal finances\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also been around average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe pick-up in consumption growth stood in contrast to the ongoing weakness in labour incomes,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the household saving ratio declining in the December quarter. Members noted that over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast two decades movements in the Australian household saving ratio had been much larger than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose in other similar economies. One contributing factor was likely to have been that Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad experienced a much larger terms of trade cycle than other developed economies with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant commodity exports. Differences in the evolution of household saving ratios across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe states suggested that the terms of trade had played an important role in households' saving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand spending decisions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndicators of labour market conditions had remained mixed. Employment growth had picked up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months and the unemployment rate had edged down to 5.7 per cent in January. Leading\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators, including job advertisements and firms' employment intentions, suggested that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould be some pick-up in employment growth in the near term. Members noted that although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperience had varied across the states, in recent years employment growth had generally been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger in the capital cities than in regional areas. Employment growth had continued to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcentrated in part-time jobs over the past year and wage growth had remained low, suggesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the labour market had not been quite as strong as the headline employment and unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate figures had indicated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe wage price index had increased by 1.9 per cent over 2016, in line with the staff forecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSubdued wage growth appeared to have been broad based and was most pronounced in mining-related\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustries and states. Average earnings per hour in the national accounts had fallen sharply in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe December quarter, as had the wage bill as a share of nominal GDP. Although quarterly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovements in average earnings per hour are volatile, this measure of wage growth had also been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued in year-ended terms, continuing to suggest there was very little labour cost pressure in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy. Members noted that the recent experience of low inflation may also have contributed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lower wage outcomes and that other business costs, such as rents, are often linked to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation. Members observed that although credit growth was lower than in previous decades, it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been faster than the subdued growth in household incomes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion by noting that global financial markets had been relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquiet over the preceding month, with market participants focused on evolving expectations about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting, the new US administration's policies and national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telections in Europe in coming months. Globally, monetary policy remained very stimulatory and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancing remained readily available on favourable terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market participants' expectations for an increase in the federal funds rate at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had risen to over 90 per cent. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed continued positive economic news in the United States as well as statements by FOMC\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers. Members noted the widely held expectations for no change in monetary policy settings in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe euro area and Japan, compared with the general view earlier in the previous year that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther monetary easing was in prospect in these economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn major markets, 10-year government bond yields remained above their lows of mid 2016,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting the run of more positive economic news since then, as well as expectations that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew US administration's policies would support US growth. Members observed that, although euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarea government bond spreads to German government bonds had increased over recent months in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponse to political developments, yields remained relatively low by historical standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCorporate bond yields in developed markets remained very low, with spreads to government bonds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving narrowed markedly over the previous year, particularly for non-investment grade bonds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian government bond yields had been little changed over the month and the spread to US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTreasury yields had also been steady at a low level.

In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro area, banks' share prices had declined following lower-than-expected earnings, which were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely related to loan-loss provisions. Over the previous year or so, Australian share prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad moved broadly in line with those in the rest of the world excluding the United States, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare prices had risen further. Recent Australian company earnings results had been generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositive, driven by strong profits in the resources sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US dollar had been little changed over the prior month in nominal trade-weighted terms,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile the euro had depreciated a little against the US dollar, in part reflecting political\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty around the upcoming national elections.

The tightening had flowed through to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased corporate bond spreads; recent bond issuance in China had been weak after a sustained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod of strength, although yields had remained low.

A number of indicators, including growth in global industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction, global trade volumes and business sentiment, had improved. Recent data had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed the pick-up in global inflation. Financial market data suggested that the probability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Federal Reserve increasing the federal funds rate at the March meeting had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkedly and there was no longer an expectation of further monetary easing in other major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. At the same time, however, there continued to be significant uncertainty about policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin China and the United States and the implications for global growth and trade after 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, there had been a significant increase in the terms of trade in the second half of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2016 and many commodity prices had risen further in recent months. Although mining companies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere expected to increase their dividend payouts following the sharp rise in mining sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofits in the December quarter, a significant proportion of shareholders are non-residents,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich would limit the flow-through to an increase in household incomes in Australia. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fact that the recent increases in commodity prices had been supported by a pick-up in global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand raised the possibility that commodity prices could be higher than expected, in which case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe flow-through to the domestic economy could be larger than currently forecast.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian economy had continued to make its transition following the end of the mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment boom, supported by the low level of interest rates and the depreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate since 2013. GDP growth had picked up in the December quarter to be around 2½ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over 2016, which was only a little below estimates of the medium-term potential growth rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the economy. This outcome confirmed that the weakness in the September quarter was temporary.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking forward, year-ended growth was expected to pick up gradually to be above its potential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate over the forecast period.

Domestic wage pressures remained subdued and household income growth had been low,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich, if it were to persist, would have implications for consumption growth and the risks posed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the level of household debt.

At the point that these latest increases were to come into effect, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcumulative increase since November would be an average of around 25 basis points for loans\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto investors with scheduled repayments of principal and interest, and only a slight increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor loans of this type to owner-occupiers. In addition, by April the four major banks all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould have introduced higher interest rates for interest-only lending, with an average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpremium relative to principal and interest lending of around 15 basis points. As a result,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors with interest-only loans on variable rates would be facing benchmark interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trates similar to those that applied to the same product about three years earlier.

Although credit to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold sector had been growing modestly relative to history, growth had been faster than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincome growth and the aggregate debt-to-income ratio for households had increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, indicators of financial stress in the household sector remained contained. Low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates and improved lending standards over recent years had been supporting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds' ability to service debt, and households on average had continued to build\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trepayment buffers. Members noted, however, that some households with home loans appeared to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave little or no buffer of excess mortgage repayments and could be vulnerable if household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincome were lower than expected. This observation emphasised the importance of realistic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassessments of household expenses and prudent lending standards for mitigating risks to both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial stability and macroeconomic outcomes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the recent actions taken by APRA and the Australian Securities and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestments Commission to support prudent lending practices.

APRA's guidance had included limits on the share of interest-only loans in new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousing loans and a requirement that banks impose strict limits on new interest-only lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat high loan-to-valuation ratios.

Both headline and underlying measures of inflation had been ½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter. In year-ended terms, headline inflation had been a little above 2 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcent and underlying inflation had increased to around 1¾ per cent.

At the same time, there had been some indications that the large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in supply in the inner-city Melbourne and Brisbane apartment markets had weighed on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprices, particularly in the case of Brisbane.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that surveys of business conditions had continued to improve and that some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvey measures of investment intentions had picked up.

An increase in labour demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcould, in the first instance, be met partly by increasing hours worked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby part-time employees, which would reduce measures of underemployment but represent an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupside risk to the unemployment rate forecasts.

Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata on vacancies and surveyed employment intentions, indicated that employment growth would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpick up a little. Wage growth was expected to increase gradually as labour market conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timproved and the adjustment to the lower mining investment and terms of trade drew to an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tend.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers had an in-depth discussion about changes in the composition of employment in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecades. They discussed the implications of the secular upward trend in the share of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpart-time employment for labour market spare capacity. The share of part-time employment in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia, which had increased from around 10 per cent in the early 1970s to over one-third\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat present, was relatively high by international standards, especially for younger workers;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone driver is that students in Australia are more likely to combine their studies with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpart-time jobs. Data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that the majority of part-time workers worked part-time as a matter of choice\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven their personal circumstances, which vary across their lifecycle. People aged between\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t15 and 24 years are more likely to work part-time at the same time as studying, while a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant share of women between the ages of 25 and 44 years cite child-caring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresponsibilities as their main reason for working part-time. Furthermore, some older workers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicate a preference for working part-time, possibly as part of their transition to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretirement. The survey also indicated that some part-time workers cite a lack of full-time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\topportunities or that their work requires part-time hours as the main reason for working\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpart-time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that growth in part-time employment had become more cyclical over time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause businesses had been more able to respond to changes in demand by adjusting the hours\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworked by employees rather than the number of employees. This increase in labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflexibility had been enabled by a range of factors including labour market deregulation,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnological change and the shift towards a more service-based economy. As a result, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdistinction between full-time and part-time work had become less important in assessing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market conditions. In addition, understanding the degree of spare capacity in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy required an assessment of the additional hours part-time workers were willing and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\table to contribute as well as the number of unemployed people.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners had picked up since mid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016 and most forecasters had revised up their outlook for global growth.

The stronger activity had been evident in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in various indicators, including industrial production and measures of business and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumer sentiment, as well as in a broad-based rise in global trade.

Risks around rapid housing price growth had remained a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsource of concern for the authorities and some ratcheting up of tightening measures had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneeded to contain housing price inflation and speculative activity.

The low level of the term premium implied that market participants were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally not concerned about the prospect of a sharp rise in either inflation or real\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates, and/or that compensation for these risks was low for other reasons,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding possibly the lack of suitable alternatives for a number of market participants to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvesting in long-term US government securities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe major central banks had left policy settings and the nature of their policy guidance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely unchanged since the previous meeting. The minutes of the previous US Federal Open\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Committee meeting had highlighted that the Federal Reserve was likely to begin\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshrinking its balance sheet gradually later in 2017. The European Central Bank had earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslowed its rate of asset purchases and was expected to reduce it further in 2018. The Bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Japan was expected to continue with its asset purchase program.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had been little changed on a trade-weighted basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover the preceding month and was around its level immediately before the US election. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teuro had appreciated a little further since the previous meeting, in response to an easing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof political risks following election outcomes and generally positive economic developments.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had depreciated a little over the preceding month on a trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis, consistent with the decline in commodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter several years of depreciation in the renminbi against the US dollar and net private\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital outflows from China, the exchange rate of the renminbi against the US dollar had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstabilised since the end of 2016, although it had appreciated a little very recently. At the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsame time, net capital outflows had declined markedly as the authorities had increased their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscrutiny over capital flows. Members noted that the People's Bank of China had recently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadjusted the daily fixing mechanism for the exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that global financing conditions had remained generally favourable, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporate bond yields having declined in most major economies and emerging markets, as well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas in Australia, over the preceding month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast to developments elsewhere, in China sovereign and corporate bond yields had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trisen further in response to measures aimed at reducing leverage in the financial system and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timproving the transparency of investment products. One consequence of these actions had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treduced demand for corporate bonds and hence issuance of these bonds had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticeably. Members observed that household credit growth in China had continued to rise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMajor share markets had been increasing over 2017 to date, but banks' share prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally declined over prior months. In the United States, these falls had reflected the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket's changing expectations about implementation of the US administration's policy agenda\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand, in Japan, bank share prices had declined following lower-than-expected corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearnings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian share prices had declined over the preceding month, to return to around their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels at the end of 2016. The decline had been driven by a sizeable fall in bank share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprices. Members noted that some part of this reflected the fall in bank share prices in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal markets, but that there had also been a range of domestic factors contributing to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfall, including somewhat mixed bank profit results relative to expectations and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tannouncement of a major bank levy in the Australian Government Budget. In the days following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStandard &amp; Poor's announcement lowering the ratings of a number of smaller Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial institutions, equity prices of these institutions generally fell relative to those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had not been downgraded. Members noted that the magnitude of the major bank levy was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot particularly large compared with typical market movements in bank funding costs. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso noted that there was likely to be some effect of the rating downgrade on the cost of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twholesale funding for smaller financial institutions, but these institutions accessed less\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twholesale funding than the major banks. More broadly, bank funding costs were estimated to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave declined a little further in recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market pricing continued to indicate an expectation that the cash rate would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremain unchanged over the remainder of 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed how financial stability considerations bear on monetary policy decisions,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treviewing both the academic literature and policy experience in a number of countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding Sweden and the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank has responsibility for promoting financial stability within its flexible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-term inflation targeting framework. Over recent times, with interest rates at low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels, the Board has set monetary policy to support the economy in its transition following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mining investment boom, while also paying close attention to trends in household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowing and related financial stability considerations. Members discussed the effect of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy decisions on financial stability and on future inflation, employment and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutput. They also discussed the role that prudential supervision can play in promoting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial stability. In view of this, members acknowledged the importance of a strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship between the Bank and other regulators, particularly APRA. They observed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe current positive culture of cooperation across the relevant agencies in Australia has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen of considerable value to good policy outcomes in recent years and it is therefore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timportant that it be maintained. The strong relationship among regulators is facilitated by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Council of Financial Regulators, which is the coordinating body for the main financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregulatory agencies to promote the stability of the Australian financial system, as well as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of financial regulation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the immediate decision regarding the level of the cash rate, members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe broad-based pick-up in the world economy was continuing. Labour markets had tightened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther in many countries and this was expected to lead to a pick-up in wages and prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover time. Headline inflation rates in most countries had moved higher over the past year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly reflecting higher commodity prices. Nonetheless, core inflation had remained low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, members' assessment was that the transition to lower levels of mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment following the mining investment boom was almost complete. Surveyed business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had improved and business investment had picked up in those parts of the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot directly affected by the decline in mining investment. Although year-ended GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to have slowed in the March quarter, reflecting the quarter-to-quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvariation in the figures, members noted that economic growth was still expected to increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually over the next couple of years to a little above 3 per cent per annum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, although employment growth had been stronger in recent months, growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttotal hours worked had declined. Nevertheless, the various forward-looking indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpointed to continued growth in employment over the period ahead and a gradual erosion of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspare capacity in the labour market. Wage growth had remained low and this was likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremain the case for some time yet. However, wage growth and inflation were expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease gradually as the economy strengthened. Members observed that low growth in incomes,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talong with high levels of household debt, appeared to have been restraining growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold consumption.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe economic outlook continued to be supported by the low level of interest rates. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 had also assisted the economy in its transition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the housing market had continued to vary considerably around the country.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHousing prices had been rising briskly in some markets, although there had been some signs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat price pressures were starting to ease. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. Growth in housing debt had outpaced the slow growth in household incomes. APRA's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecent prudential supervision measures should help address the risks associated with high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand rising levels of indebtedness. In response to those measures, increases in mortgage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trates, particularly for investors and interest-only loans, had been announced, but were yet\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have their full effect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board continued to judge that developments in the labour and housing markets warranted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcareful monitoring.

GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained below Bank estimates of potential output growth, consistent with spare capacity in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe labour market and low inflation. New South Wales and Victoria had continued to make the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargest contributions to year-ended growth in domestic demand. Although domestic demand had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined again in Western Australia, there were some signs of improvement in that state.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuarterly growth was expected to have increased in the June quarter despite the disruptions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto coal export volumes following Cyclone Debbie.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Growth in household consumption had slowed in the March quarter in line with subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold income growth. More timely indicators suggested that household spending had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthened in the June quarter. The value of retail sales had increased in April,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with liaison reports that suggested conditions in the retail sector had improved.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the recent pick-up in growth in employment should also support a pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin household income growth, and therefore consumption growth, in the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members discussed the decline in dwelling investment in the March quarter, noting that it had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen concentrated in Queensland and in New South Wales, where activity had been affected by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twet weather. While the flow of new project approvals had been noticeably lower in prior\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths, the large pipeline of projects was expected to support building activity at a high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel over the subsequent year or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Conditions in established housing markets and for new construction had continued to vary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly across the country and between dwelling types. Sydney and Melbourne remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strongest markets, consistent with relatively high population growth. Members observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat population growth had been particularly high in Victoria, because of high migration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom overseas and interstate. In contrast, Western Australia had experienced a sharp decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin population growth following the end of the mining investment boom. Auction clearance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trates in Sydney and Melbourne had softened recently, suggesting that conditions in these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had eased somewhat. Housing prices in Perth and apartment prices in Brisbane had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen further. Members noted that there had been several periods in the preceding decade in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich housing prices had fallen, or growth had slowed significantly, in different parts of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe country.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Private business investment had increased in the March quarter, driven by an unexpected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in mining investment. Non-mining investment had declined a little in the quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut had been gradually trending up for a number of years. Over the previous five years, most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the growth in business investment had occurred in Victoria and New South Wales. Survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures of current business conditions had generally remained well above average and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprofits of the private non-financial sector had risen again in the March quarter, to be 30\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent higher over the prior year. Most of the increase had been accounted for by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmining sector, but other industries had also recorded higher profits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Public demand had increased modestly in the March quarter. The most recent Australian and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstate government budgets suggested that fiscal policy would be more expansionary in 2017/18\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan had previously been expected. Some of this expansion was expected to come from more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspending on public infrastructure, particularly in New South Wales. Reflecting this, work\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyet to be done on public infrastructure had increased in recent quarters to a relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh share of GDP. Members noted that infrastructure investment was expected to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant positive spillovers to other parts of the economy.

A temporary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in the volume of resource exports in the March quarter had been offset to some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\textent by ongoing strength in service exports and a pick-up in grain exports as a result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong winter crop production. The trade balance was recorded as having been in surplus for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe second consecutive quarter. Coal export volumes were expected to have fallen in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter as a result of Cyclone Debbie, while iron ore and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvolumes were expected to have increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Recent data had provided further confirmation that labour market conditions had improved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsince late 2016, consistent with signals from forward-looking indicators in previous months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth had been strong in May for the third consecutive month. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in the preceding few months had been driven entirely by full-time employment and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttotal hours worked had trended higher as a result. The unemployment rate had declined by 0.3\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpercentage points over the previous two months, to be at its lowest rate since early 2013.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the underemployment rate, which measures the number of part-time workers wanting to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twork more hours, had remained elevated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Over the preceding five years or so, the household services sector had contributed the most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto increases in full-time and part-time employment. Full-time employment had also increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly in business services over this period, but had fallen in the goods-related\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. Employment growth had remained highest in Victoria over the year and had started to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpick up in New South Wales in recent months, following soft conditions over the prior year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market conditions in Western Australia and Queensland appeared to have improved.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Forward-looking indicators of labour demand, such as job advertisements and business hiring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions, had remained positive and generally consistent with the patterns of employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tacross states and industries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Wage measures in the March quarter national accounts had continued to suggest that labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcost pressures remained subdued. The Fair Work Commission had announced a 3.3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in award wages and the national minimum wage, effective from 1 July 2017. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed an increase of 2.4 per cent in 2016 and was likely to affect the wages of around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo-fifths of workers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that wholesale electricity prices had risen sharply over the first half of 2017\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand that this had led to significant increases in prices for retail customers. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed these increases in the context of efforts to address climate change and to alter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia's energy mix. Concerns about energy security, reliability and costs had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theightened over the preceding six months or so, partly reflecting policy uncertainty and its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on the investment decisions of electricity generators. Members also discussed how\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in the LNG sector had affected the costs and decisions of electricity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerators.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the improvement in the world economy was continuing and that output\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in some economies in the March quarter had been a little stronger than expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMerchandise trade and industrial production had increased further in the preceding months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHigher trade volumes had spurred investment and supported growth, particularly in Japan and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother high-income economies in east Asia. Members noted that the ongoing growth in business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in the major advanced economies and east Asia was a positive sign for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsustainability of global growth in the period ahead. Labour markets in the major advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies had continued to strengthen, which was also a positive development for more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsustained global growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Core inflation had remained low and headline inflation had turned down in a number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, as the effect of higher energy prices in 2016 had dissipated.

Growth in investment had been stable, as a solid rise in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate investment growth had more than offset a slowing in public investment growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConsistent with this, Chinese demand for commodities had been resilient.

Members noted that growth in business financing had been stable over 2017 to date,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas higher growth in business loans had offset a moderation in the growth of securities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The slowdown in GDP growth in the United States in the March quarter appeared to have been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttemporary.

This equated to a neutral\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnominal cash rate of around 3½ per cent, given that medium-term inflation expectations were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell anchored around 2½ per cent, although there is significant uncertainty around this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\testimate. Members noted that some of this decline could be attributed to lower potential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutput growth, but the increase in risk aversion around the time of the global financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcrisis was likely to have been a more important factor, given that the bulk of the decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the estimated neutral real interest rate had occurred around that time. Estimates of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneutral real interest rates for other economies had shown a similar decline. All estimates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the neutral real interest rate for Australia suggested that monetary policy had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclearly expansionary for the preceding five years or so. It was also noted that a reduction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin risk aversion and/or an increase in the potential growth rate could see the neutral real\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rate rise again.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Turning to the immediate decision regarding the level of the cash rate, members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe broad-based recovery in the global economy had continued. There had been further signs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat investment was increasing and labour markets had tightened further in many advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. This was expected to lead to a pick-up in growth in wages and prices over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this context, members noted that a number of central banks had become more positive about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic economic conditions, and financial market pricing suggested that there had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupward revisions to the expected path of future monetary policy in these economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Domestically, the data available for the June quarter had generally been positive, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slower growth recorded for the March quarter.

Against this background, the recent improvement in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market data had been a positive development.

Recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstate budgets and data on non-residential construction suggested that the contribution to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth from infrastructure investment would rise. The pipeline of residential construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to support dwelling investment over the forecast period. The economic outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to be supported by the low level of interest rates. The depreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate since 2013 had also assisted the economy in its transition following the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Conditions in established housing markets had continued to vary considerably across the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry. Members recognised that it was too early for the prudential supervision measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tannounced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, which were designed to help\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taddress the risks associated with high and rising levels of indebtedness, to have had their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfull effect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members regarded the improvement in the world economy over the preceding months as a welcome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopment.

Both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumer Price Index (CPI) inflation and measures of underlying inflation were running at a little under 2 per cent \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin year-ended terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-tradables inflation had reached its highest year-ended rate in two years in the June quarter, boosted by rises\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin tobacco excise and utilities prices. Market services inflation had increased since 2016, but remained low; around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thalf of total costs in the market services sector are labour costs, and these had been subdued over recent years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInflation in the costs of constructing a new dwelling had also increased over the prior year in all capital cities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother than Perth and Adelaide. In contrast, rents had been increasing at a below-average pace in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne, had been falling in Perth and had been broadly stable in most other capital cities. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prices of tradable consumer durable items had declined over the year, partly reflecting the appreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate and heightened competition from foreign retailers. Inflation in food prices (excluding fruit and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvegetables) had been running at low rates for several years. Supply disruptions from Cyclone Debbie had had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively little net effect on fruit and vegetables prices in the June quarter.

This was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto lead to lower reported CPI inflation because the weights of items whose prices had fallen were likely to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigher, whereas the weights of items whose prices had risen were likely to be lower.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn their discussion of the outlook for the domestic economy, members noted that the Bank's forecasts for output\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and inflation were largely unchanged from three months earlier. They noted that the forecasts were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditioned on the assumption of no change in the Australian dollar exchange rate during the forecast period, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\textends to the end of 2019, and that this assumption was one source of uncertainty. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe available data on activity suggested that GDP growth had increased in the June quarter, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker-than-expected growth in the March quarter. Output growth was expected to reach around 3 per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended terms during 2018 and 2019, which was a little higher than estimates of potential growth. The recent data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad indicated that consumption growth had increased in the June quarter. The value of retail sales had risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly in April and May, and the increases had been broadly based both nationally and across spending categories.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeyond the June quarter, rising employment and stronger household income growth were expected to support consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, which was forecast to be a little above its average of recent years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment was expected to recover from the weakness in the March quarter, which was partly the result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twet weather in New South Wales, and remain at a high level over the following year or so, sustained by the large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpipeline of residential building work already approved or under way. The number of new residential building\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapprovals had stepped down since 2016 and members noted that, if approvals remained at current levels, construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity could also begin to decline. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe established housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne had remained the strongest in the country, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had eased since late 2016.

Coking coal exports had returned to pre-cyclone levels in May, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tliquefied natural gas exports had continued to increase. The decline in mining investment was expected to run its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse in the following year or so and thereafter no longer be a drag on growth. Resource exports were expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmake a significant contribution to GDP growth over the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestment by non-mining businesses was expected to pick up later in the forecast period in response to stronger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in demand. Businesses had continued to report above-average business conditions and members noted that many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the conditions that might typically be associated with stronger growth in investment were in place. Some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of non-mining investment, including recent strength in sales of commercial motor vehicles and the higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment intentions recorded in the NAB survey, had been more positive in the period leading up to the meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increase in the level of non-residential building approvals had also signalled a more positive outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate non-residential construction, although the pipeline of work to be done was at low levels. The pipeline of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic infrastructure activity had increased over the previous few years, to be at its highest share of GDP since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mid 1980s.

Employment had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin every state since the start of 2017, including solid growth in the mining-exposed states. This provided further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence that the drag on economic activity from earlier declines in the terms of trade and falling mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment were running their course. Over this period, around 165,000 full-time jobs had been created, labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforce participation had risen and average hours worked had increased. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unemployment rate had been little changed in June at 5.6 per cent and underemployment had edged lower over prior\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths. Indicators of labour demand had pointed to further employment growth and little change in the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trate over coming quarters. By the end of the forecast period, the unemployment rate was expected to be just below 5½ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcent, slightly lower than forecast in May but still implying a degree of spare capacity in the labour market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the recent improvement in labour market conditions and the increase in award wages should help\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport household incomes and thus spending. Some upside risk to spending could be envisaged if employment were to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe higher than forecast. On the other hand, expectations of ongoing low wage growth could weigh on consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. Spending could also be constrained by elevated levels of household debt, especially if housing market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were to weaken.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore broadly, members noted there was some uncertainty about the effect any decline in spare capacity in the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket would have on wage and price inflation. Information from liaison indicated that some employers were finding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit harder to attract workers with particular skills. If this were to broaden, wage growth could increase more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquickly than forecast, which would see inflationary pressures also emerge more quickly. However, wage and price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation had not increased by as much as expected in other economies around the world that are already close to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfull employment, which raised the possibility that low inflation in Australia might also persist longer than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the inflation forecast, members noted that underlying inflation was expected to be close to 2 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcent in the second half of 2017 and to edge higher over the subsequent two years. Most of the difference between\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theadline and underlying inflation over the forecast period could be accounted for by further increases in tobacco\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texcise and utilities prices. Retail electricity prices were expected to increase sharply in the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the increases in retail prices in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia on 1 July, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe March quarter 2018, when similar increases were expected in Victoria. Members acknowledged that the second-round\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teffects of higher utilities prices on retail prices through business costs were uncertain, partly because it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunclear when utilities contracts for businesses would be subject to renewal. Members also observed that energy is a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively low share of costs for most businesses, although it is higher for some businesses that compete in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinternational markets. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe inflation forecast partly reflected an expectation of a modest increase in wage growth as labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions tightened further and the drag on activity and incomes from falls in mining investment and the terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade diminished. Working in the opposite direction were the effects of additional competition in the retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry, the dampening effect of expanding housing supply on growth in rents, and the recent exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappreciation. Headline inflation had been revised a little higher in the updated forecasts, mostly reflecting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprospect of faster growth in utilities prices, and was expected to be between 2 and 3 per cent over much of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that economic conditions had strengthened over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe prior year and the improvement had broadened beyond international trade. In particular, growth in business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had picked up in several advanced and emerging economies, including the United States, Canada, Japan and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta number of economies in east Asia. Consumption growth had been resilient. Recent GDP data had generally confirmed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier expectations and, accordingly, the forecast for global growth had been little changed since that published\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. A gradual increase in global inflationary pressures over the subsequent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcouple of years had seemed likely, as spare capacity in many advanced economies was expected to be absorbed,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresulting in higher wage growth. However, as members noted, even though labour market conditions had already\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttightened in some advanced economies, wage growth and core inflation had remained subdued.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in GDP in China had been a little stronger than expected in the June quarter, supported by accommodative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial conditions and expansionary fiscal policy. The strengthening in conditions in the industrial sector over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months had been broadly based; construction activity had been resilient, although housing market policies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintroduced in some cities over the preceding year had been effective in lowering overall housing price inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDemand for both consumer goods and Chinese exports had picked up. The strength in manufacturing and construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity had contributed to higher demand for steel. As a result, imports of iron ore, including from Australia, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrended higher and prices for iron ore and coking coal had increased since the previous meeting. The outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia's thermal coal exports had not benefited to the same extent, partly because there had been an increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic Chinese production. The forecast for Australia's terms of trade had been revised up a little since May, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill implied a decline from their recent peak.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in China was expected to ease in 2018 and 2019 because of structural factors such as a declining working-age\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation, as well as policies to address financial risks. Members noted that the outlook for the Chinese economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained a significant source of uncertainty. In particular, it was unclear how the authorities would negotiate the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult trade-off between growth and the build-up of leverage in the Chinese economy. To address risks in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshadow banking sector, the authorities had recently sought to improve coordination among financial regulators and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad announced tighter regulatory measures. Members noted that such measures could be difficult to calibrate and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, as a result, financial conditions might tighten by more than expected.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth in the rest of east Asia looked to have been around estimates of potential in the first half of 2017,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by accommodative policies as well as the increase in global trade growth. Members noted that many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies in this region were deeply integrated into global supply chains, particularly for semiconductors and other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\telectronics. There had also been signs of a recovery in retail sales and a sharp increase in consumer confidence in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSouth Korea, the largest economy in the region. </p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the three largest advanced economies, investment growth had picked up and employment growth had supported growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin household incomes and consumption.

GDP growth in all three major advanced economies was expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove estimates of potential growth over the forecast period. Unemployment rates had declined to low levels in all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree economies and in the United States and Japan were below levels associated with full employment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>Members noted that over recent months most attention in international financial markets had been on changes in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations regarding monetary policy. In a number of advanced economies, monetary policy was expected to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat less accommodative than previously anticipated.</p>", "<p>At its June meeting, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased its policy rate and outlined plans for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgradual and predictable reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. More recently, the FOMC had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that the balance sheet reduction would be likely to begin relatively soon. Financial market participants\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to expect further increases in the US federal funds rate to occur more slowly than implied by the median\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprojections of FOMC participants. At its July meeting, the European Central Bank had emphasised that monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneeded to remain very accommodative, but had also indicated that it will consider whether to reduce the pace of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tasset purchases at one of its forthcoming meetings. In July, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate for the first\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime in seven years and financial market participants expected further increases. Central banks in several other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies had also adjusted their communication over recent months so as to remove earlier biases towards\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teasier monetary policy.</p>", "<p>Long-term government bond yields had responded to the changes in expectations for the stance of monetary policy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith yields in most major financial markets, as well as in Australia, having risen from their levels in early June.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted, however, that yields remained at low levels. In Japan, yields on 10-year government bonds had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained around zero during 2017, consistent with the Bank of Japan's policy of yield curve control.</p>", "<p>Members observed that financial market conditions remained very favourable. Corporate financing conditions had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to improve, with the increase in equity prices and decline in corporate bond spreads having continued over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017 in the United States and the euro area.</p>", "<p>In China, financial market conditions also remained accommodative, but had tightened since the end of 2016 as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities had instituted a range of measures to reduce leverage in financial markets. Bond yields had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkedly since late 2016, despite a slight retracement in recent months, and corporate bond issuance had slowed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing strong growth over the preceding several years. Members observed that credit availability to households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand businesses had been relatively unaffected by the regulatory measures. The renminbi exchange rate had appreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the US dollar since the beginning of 2017, but had depreciated in trade-weighted terms. The Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities had increased their scrutiny of capital flows, resulting in a decline in net capital outflows, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue of the People's Bank of China's foreign currency reserves had stabilised.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there had been a broadly based depreciation of the US dollar over 2017, including against the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar. The appreciation of the Australian dollar over the previous two months had resulted in it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturning to 2015 levels in US dollar terms and to the levels of late 2014 on a trade-weighted basis.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, housing credit growth had been steady over the first half of 2017, as a decline in growth in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit extended to investors had been offset by a slight increase in growth in housing credit to owner-occupiers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the relative increases in housing lending rates to investors compared with owner-occupiers and for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest-only loans compared with principal-and-interest loans. Overall, the average actual interest rate paid on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall outstanding housing loans was estimated to have increased slightly since late 2016. Housing loan approvals to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors had declined in recent months, which pointed to some easing in growth in housing credit to investors. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of interest-only housing loans in total loan approvals appeared to have declined noticeably in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter in response to recent measures introduced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timprove lending standards. Moreover, there was evidence of some switching of existing interest-only loans to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprincipal-and-interest loans.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian share prices had been broadly steady in recent months. Over July, bank share prices had retraced some of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir earlier decline, in line with a rise in bank share prices globally and following APRA's announcement of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional capital requirements for the banking sector, which were only slightly higher than banks' current actual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital ratios. The major banks had been issuing increasingly longer-dated bonds, including two large US-denominated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t30-year bond issues in July. Members noted that longer-dated bonds are favoured under the Net Stable Funding Ratio\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trequirement, which will come into effect in 2018.

Demand growth from the Chinese industrial sector had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger than expected and had contributed to higher commodity prices. Labour markets had continued to tighten in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of economies, but inflation had generally remained subdued. There had been a broadly based depreciation of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US dollar. Consistent with that, a number of currencies were close to their highs of the previous few years\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the US dollar, including the euro and the Canadian dollar.

Wage growth had remained low but was still expected to increase a little as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the labour market improved. Members observed that recent strong employment growth would be likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontribute to an increase in household disposable income, and therefore consumption growth, over the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod. However, ongoing low wage growth and the high level of debt on household balance sheets raised the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpossibility that consumption growth could be lower than forecast.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers regarded conditions in the housing market and household balance sheets as continuing to warrant careful\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonitoring.

Employment had risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther in July, the participation rate had edged higher and the unemployment rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained steady at 5.6 per cent. Full-time employment had risen strongly over the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear (even though it had declined in July) and had outpaced the growth in part-time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployment over that period. Members noted that the improvement in the labour market since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2016 had been broadly based across the states. Forward indicators suggested that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timprovement in labour market conditions was likely to continue. Members discussed current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinfluences on the participation rate, noting in particular the rise in participation by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tolder female workers as they delayed their retirement.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile unemployment rates in Queensland and Western Australia had remained high relative to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier periods, employment growth in those states had risen, suggesting that the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket adjustment to the earlier decline in the terms of trade and falling mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas progressing. In the context of a broader discussion of economic developments in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQueensland, members observed that economic conditions in the state had generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthened over recent quarters, reflecting continued growth in consumption and,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasingly, a pick-up in business investment and public demand. Strength in tourism and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother service industries had supported growth in aggregate demand in Queensland. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrast, population growth had been below average, reflecting lower net overseas and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterstate migration.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members discussed the broad trends in activity by industry across the eastern states over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceding decade or so. The cycle in mining activity and commodity prices, the spillover to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelated industries and the sustained strength in construction had dominated developments in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQueensland. Members noted the increasing contribution to growth from the education and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttraining sectors, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, which had been supported by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand from overseas. The trend decline in manufacturing was evident across all states on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe eastern seaboard.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The wage price index data for the June quarter confirmed that wage growth had remained stable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat a low rate. Other data showed that wage increases in new enterprise bargaining agreements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained below the average of current agreements. Members noted that these data were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the Bank's forecast for growth in wages to remain low for some time, before\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpicking up gradually in response to the strengthening labour market. The pattern of growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twages across industries had broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmirrored the pattern of employment growth, with higher outcomes in the healthcare and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teducation sectors and lower wage increases in the mining and retail sectors.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members were briefed on developments in the housing market. For Australia as a whole, after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation growth had outpaced growth in the number of dwellings for much of the decade from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mid 2000s, the converse had been true in recent years. Although dwelling investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained at a high level, members noted that building approvals had stepped down and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpipeline of residential construction work appeared to have passed its peak. In Western\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia, dwelling investment had declined significantly, while in Queensland it had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined from very high levels and the stock of work in the pipeline was being worked down\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually. Although a further substantial increase in dwelling investment was not expected,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe large amount of work remaining in the pipeline in New South Wales and Victoria suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat dwelling investment was likely to stay at a high level in the subsequent couple of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable number of new apartments was scheduled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be completed in the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In the established housing market, a number of indicators suggested that conditions had eased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney, but to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Housing price growth had slowed over 2017 in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSydney, but had remained strong in Melbourne. A similar pattern was evident in auction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclearance rates, which had declined by more in Sydney than in Melbourne. Auction volumes had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso remained relatively low in Sydney. Rent increases had remained low in most cities and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trents had continued to decline in Perth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members noted that the national accounts for the June quarter would be released the day after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe meeting and that an increase in the quarterly growth rate of GDP was likely. Solid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in retail sales suggested that household consumption growth was likely to have risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter. However, retailers had discounted prices to achieve sales, which meant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat growth in nominal retail sales had been more modest.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Non-mining business investment was expected to have increased in the June quarter, based on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecent data. Forward-looking indicators such as capacity utilisation and investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions from business surveys suggested a further pick-up was in prospect, consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the Bank's forecast for growth in non-mining investment to strengthen gradually.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-residential building approvals had picked up strongly over preceding months and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining investment intentions for 2017/18 reported in the ABS capital expenditure survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been revised upwards.

Accommodative policy settings had helped sustain growth above estimates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof potential for several years. The outlook for business investment had improved for all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree economies and the outlook for growth in consumption remained positive in light of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued improvements in labour markets. Unemployment rates in the United States and Japan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained below estimates of full employment. Although spare capacity remained in the euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarea labour market, unemployment rates had fallen in most countries and GDP per capita had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen growing. Nevertheless, growth in wages had not increased materially in any of the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies and core inflation remained low. In recent months, core inflation had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclining in the United States and Japan. Headline inflation rates had also declined,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely because of the earlier decline in oil prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In China, GDP growth had been a little stronger than expected over the first half of 2017,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by generally accommodative policy settings. Strong growth in infrastructure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had continued in July, and further sharp increases in crude steel production and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\telectricity generation had continued to support imports of coal and iron ore from Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the rest of east Asia, a pick-up in export growth as global demand strengthened had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunderpinned stronger domestic demand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members discussed the influence of China on the global iron ore and steel markets more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally. They noted that China was by far the largest consumer and importer of iron ore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tglobally. This reflected the fact that China, with the world's largest population, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treached a similar level of steel production per capita to that of industrialised economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIron ore prices had been supported at higher levels because of sustained strong demand for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsteel in China. However, prices were expected to fall in the period ahead because of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tongoing expansion of global iron ore supply following an extended period of strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment. Members also noted that Chinese steel production per capita was likely to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclose to its peak and that growth in Chinese steel production would not add much to global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand for iron ore in the future. Members observed that, in the longer run, there was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpotential for India to have a noticeable effect on commodity markets as investment in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential construction and transport infrastructure increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Members discussed the challenges facing the Chinese authorities as they balance their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommitment to short-term growth targets with their efforts to address medium-term risks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarising from high and rising levels of debt in the Chinese economy. Members also discussed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Chinese authorities' progress in implementing structural reforms announced in 2013 at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Third Plenum. There had been progress on a number of fronts, including a broadened value\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadded tax, some deregulation of interest rates and the relaxation of the one-child policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the authorities' goal of allowing the market to play a ‘decisive role’ in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallocating resources was still some way from being realised. In particular, state-owned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenterprise reform had been focused on strengthening these firms and increasing the oversight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof their activities by the Chinese Communist Party, rather than reducing the influence of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstate-owned firms in the economy. Members noted that the outcome of the 19th Congress of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese Communist Party in mid October would affect the pace and focus of further reforms,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand influence how the authorities address the tension between achieving short-term growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taims and managing the build-up of risks to financial stability associated with rising debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a muted response in markets to rising tensions on the Korean peninsula. Overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in financial markets had remained very accommodative and volatility had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlow over the preceding month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Long-term government bond yields in the major financial markets had generally declined over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe preceding month. US Treasury bond yields had reached the lowest level since the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\telection, in part reflecting continued uncertainty about the implementation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadministration's policy agenda and lower-than-expected inflation data. While the Federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve was widely expected to commence its balance sheet reduction later in 2017, market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpricing indicated that the federal funds rate was not expected to be increased until the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsecond half of 2018. Members noted that yields on US government bills that mature in early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober had increased, reflecting concerns that US legislators might not raise the US debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tceiling in time to meet funding requirements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The yield on Australian 10-year government bonds had changed little over the preceding month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe spread of Australian 10-year government bonds to US Treasuries had widened over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths, which was also the case for spreads to US Treasuries of a number of other sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbonds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Major share markets had declined a little over the preceding month, in part reflecting rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgeopolitical tension.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Major market corporate bond spreads to sovereign bonds were around their lowest levels since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe onset of the global financial crisis and overall funding conditions for companies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained favourable.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had depreciated a little further in trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tterms over the preceding month to be lower than before the US election. However, it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill well above levels at the end of the period of expansion of the Federal Reserve's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbalance sheet in 2014. In trade-weighted terms, the Japanese yen and the euro had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed over August, with the latter having appreciated over preceding months to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround late-2014 levels. The Australian dollar was little changed over August, in both US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar and trade-weighted terms. The appreciation of the Australian dollar over the course\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2017 had, in large part, reflected a broadly based depreciation of the US dollar.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>In China, tighter enforcement of capital controls by the authorities had contributed to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treduction in capital outflows in 2017 and had been accompanied by an appreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trenminbi against the US dollar.

In China, continued strong growth in infrastructure investment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported demand for commodities, although medium-term risks associated with high and rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt levels remained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>Conditions in global financial markets had generally remained very accommodative; long-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yields in the major financial markets had declined and volatility had been low.

The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in mining investment was diminishing and strength in public infrastructure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was expected.

Members acknowledged the risks to this scenario from growth in housing debt having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutpaced the slow growth in household incomes over the preceding few years. Growth in wages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand inflation had remained low but stable. This was expected to remain the case for some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime. Nevertheless, a gradual increase in growth in wages and inflation was expected as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspare capacity in the labour market was reduced and the economy continued to strengthen,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by the low level of interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>The appreciation of the Australian dollar over recent months, driven in part by a broad\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the US dollar, was weighing on domestic growth and contributing to subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflationary pressure.

Growth in consumption and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe contribution from net exports had been higher than in the March quarter, partly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting the unwinding of temporary factors. Members noted that the effect of the decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin mining investment had mostly passed and, with resource exports increasing, recently the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmining sector had been contributing to overall growth. Growth in public demand and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining business investment had picked up and private sector investment intentions for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017/18, as recorded in the June quarter ABS capital expenditure survey, had been revised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigher.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been a pick-up in household consumption growth in the June quarter despite ongoing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweakness in household disposable income growth. Members noted that consumption growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased in most states, although it had remained noticeably weaker in Western Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan in the eastern states, consistent with weaker income growth in that state. Recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong growth in employment across all the states was expected to support income growth, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttherefore consumption growth, in the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoth full-time and part-time employment had recorded solid growth in August.

Since early 2017, employment growth had been above trend, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate and other measures of labour underutilisation had declined a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(although the unemployment rate had remained steady at 5.6 per cent in recent months) and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour force participation had increased, particularly for older workers and prime-aged\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(25–54 year old) females. By industry, employment growth over the preceding year had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongest in the household services sector, particularly health care and education, and had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up notably in the construction sector. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding data on job advertisements, vacancies and hiring intentions, continued to point to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly above-average growth in employment over the remainder of 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that residential construction appeared to have plateaued, with dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment largely unchanged in the June quarter.

Housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had continued to decline gradually in Perth.

Mining investment had declined a little in the June quarter. The outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining business investment remained positive; firms’ estimates of future capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspending had increased, non-mining sector profits had picked up over the preceding year and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvey measures of capacity utilisation were well above average. Members noted that business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions, as reported in surveys, had picked up in most states, although they remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued in Western Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPublic demand had picked up in the June quarter.

This recent strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been supported by a number of large infrastructure projects, especially related to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction of roads and railways.

Headline and trimmed mean inflation had both been 1.8 per cent over the year to the September quarter, broadly in line with the Bank's expectations.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail price inflation had been low as competitive pressures in the retail sector had continued to restrain price rises. Prices for volatile items, such as fruit and vegetables, had fallen by more than expected. The appreciation of the exchange rate over the preceding two years had contributed somewhat to falls in the prices of tradeable goods, while increases in rents had also been small, consistent with the strong growth in the housing stock. Although these factors had weighed on inflation, a number of factors had been working in the opposite direction, including increases in tobacco excise, utilities prices and new dwelling construction costs. </p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the outlook for inflation would be influenced by the persistence of heightened competitive pressures, the outlook for wage growth and the speed with which wage costs might flow through to higher prices. They observed that competitive pressures had led food and other retailers to alter their business models in an effort to reduce their cost structures. These competitive pressures on both retail margins and costs were expected to continue for quite some time.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank's forecast was for underlying inflation to remain slightly below 2 per cent in the near term, before increasing gradually to 2 per cent. Headline inflation was expected to rise to 2¼ per cent by the end of the forecast period, reflecting further increases in the tobacco excise and utilities prices in addition to the gradual pick-up in underlying inflation. Recent increases in fuel prices were expected to boost headline inflation in the December quarter. </p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe forecast gradual rise in inflation was consistent with the expectation that a further tightening in labour market conditions would gradually feed into higher wage pressures. Although survey measures and the Bank's liaison suggested firms were finding it more difficult to recruit some types of labour, various measures of growth in wages had not yet picked up and had been lower in preceding quarters than forecast a year earlier. Members observed that, in most advanced economies, growth in wages and hourly earnings had been low despite ongoing reductions in spare capacity. They discussed the possibility that globalisation and technology were leading wage growth to be less responsive to changes in the demand for labour, which could continue for a while.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the weights used to construct the Consumer Price Index (CPI) would be updated in the December quarter. Following the release of the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics' Household Expenditure Survey, the weights of some items in the CPI, such as international travel and restaurant meals, would increase to reflect changes in consumption related to rising household income. The weights of some other items in the CPI, such as tobacco and audiovisual equipment, would shift because consumers had responded to changes in their prices relative to the prices of other goods and services. The inflation forecasts had been revised down a little to reflect this reweighting and because more frequent reweighting in future would reduce the ‘substitution bias’ in measured inflation. Substitution bias arises because fixed weights do not capture consumers' tendency to increase consumption of those goods and services that have become cheaper relative to other goods and services. Members noted, however, that this did not change the Bank's assessment of how inflationary pressures were likely to evolve in the forecast period.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to indicators of economic activity, retail sales had been weak in the September quarter, which was expected to translate into lower quarterly consumption growth than in the June quarter. Members noted that the outlook for consumption growth depended on the outlook for household income growth, which remained uncertain. They discussed the possibility that households might change their consumption and saving decisions if the period of low income growth persisted. Members observed that the level of consumption in the previous few years had been revised higher in the most recent annual national accounts (for 2016/17), which implied a downward revision to the household saving ratio.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the residential housing market, recent data on dwelling approvals had confirmed that the pipeline of dwellings approved or under construction appeared to have peaked in late 2016, although the pipeline of work remained at a high level. This was expected to support the level of dwelling investment over the following year or so. Conditions in the established housing market had eased in Sydney, while housing prices had changed little in Brisbane and Perth over recent months. Conditions in both the auction and private treaty markets had remained somewhat stronger in Melbourne than elsewhere. Rents had continued to fall in Perth and had been slightly lower in Brisbane, where valuations for some new inner-city apartments had declined below their purchase prices. Members discussed the importance of understanding the evolution of demographic factors and foreign demand for interpreting developments in housing markets across states.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData revisions over the previous year had boosted recorded growth in non-mining business investment in the preceding few years, partly resolving some of the inconsistency between its previously reported weakness and broader economic conditions. Forward-looking indicators of non-residential construction activity had pointed to further strength in the near term, and the pipeline of public infrastructure projects had remained high. Members noted that public infrastructure spending had boosted the activity of firms undertaking this work on behalf of the public sector, which could create positive spillovers to private business investment.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey measures of business conditions and expected capital expenditure over the year ahead had increased. Together with recent upward revisions to recorded non-mining business investment, these indicators suggested there were more upside risks to the non-mining investment forecast than there had been for some time. Members noted that both public and business investment were relatively import-intensive; the positive outlook for these components of activity implied that import volumes were also likely to grow solidly over the forecast period. </p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe volume of exports was estimated to have increased in the September quarter, as coal shipments returned to levels preceding Cyclone Debbie earlier in the year, although exports of liquefied natural gas appeared to have declined because of project delays and lower production at some sites. Members noted that both manufacturing and service exports appeared to have increased in the September quarter. Rural exports were likely to have held up as the decline in wheat exports, following the earlier record harvest, had been offset by an increase in beef exports. Bulk commodity prices had fallen over the preceding months, partly in response to announced cuts in Chinese steel production designed to address environmental concerns, while base metals prices had increased. Oil prices had also increased significantly in response to potential supply disruptions. The terms of trade were expected to fall over the forecast period, in line with previous forecasts, partly because Chinese steel production was projected to decline a little over the medium term at the same time as an expected expansion in the global supply of iron ore. Nonetheless, the terms of trade for Australia were expected to remain above their early-2016 trough.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the labour market, members observed that conditions had been surprisingly strong over 2017. Employment growth had been running well above growth in the working-age population and, in preceding months, had been concentrated in full-time employment. Employment growth had also picked up across all states. Some of the increase in demand for labour had been met with increased labour force participation, especially by women and older workers. The unemployment rate had fallen by ¼ percentage point over the year to date to 5.5 per cent.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeading indicators suggested that above-average employment growth would continue in coming quarters. More generally, the forecast for employment growth had been revised a little higher, reflecting the run of stronger labour market data in preceding months. The forecast for the participation rate had also been raised for the same reason. This implied little change in the outlook for the unemployment rate, which was forecast to decline gradually to around 5¼ per cent by the end of 2019, consistent with the forecast increase in GDP growth. Members noted that there was uncertainty about how rapidly the unemployment rate might decline, and that the forecast was conditioned on the assumption the participation rate would remain around current levels, underpinned by the cyclical strength in the labour market.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank's forecasts for growth were largely unchanged from three months earlier. The central forecast was for GDP growth to pick up and to average around 3 per cent over the next few years. Although the staff expected GDP growth to rise, the forecasts suggested that productivity growth would be relatively subdued in the near term. In light of this, members noted that the Productivity Commission had recently completed a review of the policy changes that might have the greatest effect on productivity growth. The review had pointed to the importance of data and evidence-based policymaking in areas such as health, city planning and land use, teacher training and market efficiency, with particular reference to energy markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal growth had strengthened further over 2017, having been reasonably broadly based. China and the major advanced economies had recorded stronger growth than expected in the September quarter, consistent with the upswing in global trade. More recent data implied this strength had continued. Investment had picked up in most economies, which was expected to help sustain the expansion. As a result, the near-term outlook for growth in Australia's major trading partners had been revised a little higher. Unemployment rates in the major economies had been at their lowest levels for a long while. Spare capacity in the labour market appeared to have been fully absorbed in Japan, the United States and Germany, although some spare capacity appeared to remain in other parts of the euro area.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that it was possible global growth could be more self-sustaining than currently expected because the capital stock had expanded more quickly than in recent years and labour supply had been more resilient to the effects of population ageing. This had restrained growth in wages, although there had been some signs of wage growth increasing. More generally, an expansion in productive capacity might imply a period where inflation remained low for longer than currently forecast. Indeed, despite stronger GDP growth and further declines in unemployment rates to multi-year lows, inflation had remained low in most economies. </p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the outlook for the Chinese economy remained a significant source of uncertainty for the Australian economy. Over the previous year, growth in China had tended to exceed expectations. The services sector had been the largest contributor to growth, while growth in construction and infrastructure spending had been robust despite recent efforts by the authorities to restrain the extent of activity in the housing market. This had underpinned strong Chinese demand for steel, although recently environmental concerns had led the authorities to mandate cuts to steel production.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party had pointed to broad continuity in economic policy, but placed less emphasis on growth targets and more on tackling risks to financial stability, which suggested financial conditions may be tighter than would have been the case otherwise. Members noted that upstream price pressures had been building in China over the previous year. Other east Asian economies had benefited from the global trade upswing over the previous year. Many of these economies are highly integrated into global production chains, which had recently been evident in a sharp pick-up in their exports of electronic items.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets by noting that monetary policy accommodation had continued to lessen gradually in a number of economies.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn early November, the Bank of England had increased its policy rate for the first time in 10 years and indicated that two more increases were likely to be required over the next few years. Market pricing suggested an increase in the US federal funds rate at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), in line with the median of FOMC members' projections. However, market pricing continued to suggest a more modest increase in the federal funds rate over 2018 than implied by the median FOMC projection.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that after sustained expansions in major central banks' balance sheets over many years, these central banks now held sizeable shares of government bonds outstanding in their respective markets. In October, the Federal Reserve had commenced the gradual reduction in its balance sheet, as previously announced, while the European Central Bank had announced that its asset purchases would continue through to September 2018, but at a slower rate. The Bank of Japan had indicated its intention to continue its accommodative monetary policy, including by undertaking substantial purchases of assets.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMovements in long-term government bond yields across the major markets over October had been mixed, reflecting various data outcomes and changing market expectations about monetary policy settings in response to central bank statements and political developments. However, these movements had generally been small and long-term government bond yields had remained at low levels. Members noted that the yield on Australian 10-year government bonds had been relatively steady at a low level throughout 2017.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMajor equity markets had continued to strengthen, reflecting rising earnings and a positive outlook for economic activity. Low interest rates had also been providing support to equity prices. Share prices had increased particularly strongly in Japan, following the recent elections and the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus in the period ahead. Members observed that the strength in equity markets, particularly for technology stocks, had resulted in equity market valuation measures rising to above-average levels.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that financial conditions had remained highly favourable for corporations. Corporate bond spreads in advanced economies had remained low and issuance had been strong, resulting in an increase in corporate leverage. Financial conditions had also remained accommodative in emerging markets; share prices had risen further and government bond yields had remained low as foreign capital had continued to flow into these markets.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been relatively little movement in most exchange rates over the preceding month. The US dollar had appreciated a little since early September, reflecting slightly stronger economic data outcomes and increased expectations for fiscal stimulus. Consistent with this, the differential between US government bond yields and yields on other major economies' financial assets had increased. The Australian dollar had depreciated a little in trade-weighted terms over the previous month – following weaker inflation and retail sales data than had been expected by markets – although it remained a little higher than at the start of the year.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, housing credit growth had edged lower in recent months, as lending to owner-occupiers had eased and lending to investors had stabilised at a slower pace. Growth in housing lending by major banks had slowed while that by other lenders had picked up, as major banks had been more affected by the need to restrain interest-only lending in response to the recent supervisory measures. Members observed that the recent sharp declines in interest-only loan approvals suggested that banks had comfortably met the requirement set by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) for interest-only housing loans to comprise less than 30 per cent of new housing lending. </p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that housing interest rates had increased a little over 2017, particularly for investors and interest-only loans. More recently, variable housing rates had been steady and the interest rate for some fixed-rate loans had declined somewhat. </p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter having been little changed over much of 2017, Australian share prices had increased notably over the preceding month, in line with movements in global equity markets. The increase in Australian share prices had been broadly based across different sectors.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian corporate bond spreads had continued to decline in October and corporate bond issuance had been strong in recent months. Corporate gearing had declined over 2017, with resource companies having used some of the windfall from higher commodity prices to pay down debt. Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) had been strong in 2017. Pricing of RMBS had declined over the year, although it remained slightly above levels of several years ago and substantially higher than before the global financial crisis.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpectations of future cash rate movements implied by financial market prices had been scaled back, indicating that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged over the following year or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers considered a detailed review of how the economy had evolved over the preceding year relative to the Bank's forecasts for domestic GDP growth, unemployment and inflation. Overall, the differences for these key variables were within the bounds of historical forecast errors. That said, the outcome for GDP growth had been weaker than expected, reflecting a surprisingly weak outcome in the September quarter 2016. Growth in consumption and dwelling investment over the course of 2016/17 had been lower than forecast at the time of the November 2016 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, while non-mining business investment had grown by more than forecast at that time.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recovery in labour market conditions since late 2016 had been stronger than expected, including in Queensland and Western Australia, which suggested the adjustment of the labour market to the downturn in mining investment was nearing completion. Wage growth had been somewhat weaker than expected and had been particularly low in the mining-related parts of the economy. Underlying inflation had picked up a little and had been slightly higher than forecast, but the increase in headline inflation had been smaller than forecast.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that over the past year there had been a decline in the unemployment rate and a gradual increase in inflation. These developments were consistent with the flexible inflation-targeting framework, which has allowed the Board to balance the need to support aggregate demand and reduce spare capacity in the labour market with the need to manage risks associated with high and rising household debt.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the immediate decision regarding the level of the cash rate, members noted that GDP growth had been stronger than expected in a number of major economies in the September quarter and that the outlook for global economic conditions had continued to improve. Accommodative financial conditions around the world had continued to support above-trend growth. Although unemployment rates had continued to fall, wage growth had been slow to increase in many economies and core inflation had remained low.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the outlook for growth in the Australian economy was largely unchanged from three months previously. GDP growth was expected to increase and average around 3 per cent over the next few years as the drag from mining investment diminished and export growth continued. Growth in both public investment and non-mining business investment was still expected to pick up. In the medium term, consumption was expected to grow at around its average pace following the financial crisis. Dwelling construction was likely to remain high over the following year or so, given the large pipeline of work, but it was not expected to add further to growth.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStrong employment growth in the preceding year had been met partly by an increase in labour force participation, but the unemployment rate had declined and was forecast to edge lower. Wage growth had remained low. It was expected to increase gradually over the forecast period as spare capacity in the labour market diminished and the dampening effects of compositional changes associated with the adjustment of the economy to the end of the mining investment boom abated. Members noted, however, that there was considerable uncertainty around when and how quickly wage pressures might emerge and about how much these would add to inflationary pressure. In particular, they noted that, among other factors, pressure on margins from strong competition and a faster-than-expected pick-up in productivity growth could delay the pass-through of tighter labour market conditions to inflationary pressure.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInflation was expected to increase, but only gradually. The forecasts had been updated to account for short-term factors, such as fluctuations in electricity and petrol prices, as well as for the effect of more frequent reweighting of the CPI in future. Members observed that any further appreciation of the exchange rate would lead to a slower-than-forecast pick-up in inflation and economic activity.</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the established housing market had eased in all major cities, but had remained relatively strong in Melbourne. Growth in rents had been subdued. Housing credit growth had eased a little, although it remained faster than household income growth. The profile of new lending had shifted away from interest-only and other riskier types of lending, following the introduction of supervisory measures by APRA to address the medium-term risks associated with high and rising household indebtedness. </p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking into account the available information and the Bank's most recent set of forecasts, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.</p>"]}},

Starting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin March, the ECB plans to purchase €60 billion of securities each\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, well above the current rate of purchases of private securities; sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbonds would be bought in proportion to member countries' contributions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the ECB's capital. Debt purchases would continue until there was a sustained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in inflation, but they would end no earlier than September 2016. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould increase the size of the ECB's balance sheet past its 2012 peak of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t€3.1 trillion. While less than the US Federal Reserve's maximum purchases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof US$85 billion a month, on an annualised basis the ECB's purchases would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe equivalent to around 7½ per cent of the euro area's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannual GDP, compared with 6 per cent of US GDP for purchases by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFederal Reserve (and 16 per cent of Japanese GDP for purchases by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Bank of Japan).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the Federal Reserve continued to indicate that it expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstart increasing its policy rate around the middle of this year, but financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had pushed back expectations for the first rate rise in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates to around the end of the year. A number of central banks had eased policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent months in response to the effect of lower oil prices, including the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve Bank of India and the Bank of Canada. Markets had also pushed back\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations for policy tightening by a number of other central banks. In contrast,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe central banks of Russia and Brazil had increased their policy rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Swiss National Bank (SNB) abandoned its exchange rate ceiling against the euro,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been in place since September 2011, and lowered the rate on bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeposits at the SNB by 50 basis points to −0.75 per cent. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSNB's announcement noted that divergences between the monetary policies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the major currency areas had increased significantly. The move surprised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, resulting in considerable market volatility and the bankruptcy of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral foreign exchange brokers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that sovereign bond yields in the major markets had fallen significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the December meeting. The falls had occurred across the yield curve but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere particularly pronounced at longer maturities, with yields on 10-year bonds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States falling back to around 1.6 per cent and those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Germany and Japan reaching historic lows of 30 and 20 basis points, respectively.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt these levels there was very little, if any, compensation for term risk.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor maturities up to five years, yields on bonds issued by Japan, Germany and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost of the core euro area economies, as well as Sweden and Switzerland, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen below zero. Yields on Australian government bonds had mostly tracked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal developments and had also fallen considerably, with the 10-year yield\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclining to a historical low below 2½ per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe declines in global bond yields reflected a number of factors but the extent of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe decline in yields was difficult to explain.

They noted that, all else being equal,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta sustained further depreciation would, if it occurred, stimulate growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe domestic economy and put some temporary upward pressure on inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there was considerable uncertainty around the timing and extent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the expected increase in household consumption growth and non-mining business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment. Although fundamental factors such as low interest rates and strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation growth remained in place, they had not been sufficient to see a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant pick-up in the growth of these variables or a decline in the degree\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof spare capacity in the labour market. In addition, recent data suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the expected improvement in economic conditions would occur later than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been previously expected.

The unemployment rate was therefore expected to peak a little higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(and later) than in the previous forecast. The net effect of declining commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices and the depreciation of the exchange rate was expected to boost growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the forecast period. Nonetheless, the higher degree of spare capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow in prospect and lower oil prices had led to a lowering of the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor inflation, offset somewhat by the effects of the recent exchange rate depreciation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe restrained pace of wage increases over the past year or so and accompanying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in productivity, which had dampened growth in unit labour costs, suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat low rates of inflation were likely to be sustained.

More timely data had indicated that growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe value of retail trade in January and February was about average and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumer confidence had been close to average levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMining investment was estimated to have declined by 13 per cent over 2014 and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan even larger decline was expected over 2015.

Changes to the stance of monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy by any of the major central banks and further significant developments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Europe had the potential to affect financial market conditions in Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding the exchange rate, over the coming year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tData available at the time of the meeting suggested that the Australian economy had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to grow somewhat below trend in the December quarter and into the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst quarter of 2015. There had been evidence to suggest that the growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption and dwelling investment had picked up, supported by the very low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels of interest rates. Exports were also growing. However, a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in non-mining business investment was yet to occur and several indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested it would remain subdued for longer than had earlier been anticipated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the recent declines in bulk commodity prices could, at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmargin, lead to a larger-than-expected fall in mining investment and some decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the production of iron ore and coal. Data for the labour market suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the economy was likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some time and that labour market conditions were likely to remain subdued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a result, wage pressures were expected to remain contained and inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next year or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers remained alert to the possibility that the low levels of interest rates could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoster imbalances in the housing market.

They also acknowledged that a lower exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate would help achieve more balanced growth in the economy. Further depreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Australian dollar was likely given the recent declines in key commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering whether or not to reduce the cash rate further at this meeting, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the various channels through which monetary policy was affecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy at present, including the asset price and exchange rate channels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn assessing the operation of the cash flow channel in particular, they noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the responsiveness of borrowers and savers to changes in interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand asset prices was unusually uncertain in a world of very low interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand high household leverage.

They noted that growth appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have slowed in China and that the weakness in the Chinese property market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to represent a significant risk both for Chinese growth and demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor construction-related commodities. Lower growth in the demand for commodities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad contributed to the lower prices of Australia's key commodity exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the beginning of the year. As a result, Australia's terms of trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere expected to decline a little more than was forecast three months ago.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn their discussion of the appropriate course for monetary policy, members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe revised staff forecasts for the domestic economy. Although the recent flow\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof data had been generally positive, there had also been indications that future\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital spending in both the mining and non-mining sectors would be weaker\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan expected. Overall, compared with the previous set of forecasts, growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now expected to take longer to strengthen and the unemployment rate was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to remain elevated for longer. This change, and generally subdued growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof domestic costs, including wages, implied that inflation was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe slightly lower than in earlier forecasts though still consistent with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget. On the face of it, this meant that it would be appropriate to consider\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan easing of monetary policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers also discussed the potential risk that low levels of interest rates could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoster imbalances in the housing market. While concerned about the very strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpace of growth of housing prices in Sydney, and observing that conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne were strong, members saw much more muted trends in other capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities. As at previous meetings, they acknowledged the risks that could accompany\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta sustained increase in leverage from already high levels, should that occur,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that the expansionary effects of lower interest rates could be less than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past. On the data available for this meeting, however, it did not appear\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the growth of housing credit, either for investment or owner-occupancy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurposes, had been increasing over recent months. The Bank would continue to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork with other regulators to assess and contain the risks arising from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore broadly, members noted that the low levels of interest rates were helping to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport demand in the face of a number of persistent headwinds and that a further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduction in the cash rate would provide some additional support to economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity by reinforcing recent encouraging trends in household demand. In turn,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis would support non-mining business investment insofar as demand conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere the main factor constraining these decisions. Such outcomes would be expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tultimately to lead to stronger labour market conditions. Members also noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat further depreciation of the exchange rate seemed to be both likely and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessary, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that such an outcome would help to achieve more balanced growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy and assist with the transition to a lower terms of trade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the timing of any interest rate adjustment.

The rise in yields was viewed primarily\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a correction from unduly low levels, rather than a reaction to economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments, and the sell-off only returned yields to their still low levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof late last year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLonger-term sovereign yields in most other developed countries, including Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso rose significantly, while increases in yields on emerging market sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt were generally smaller.

Forward-looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators pointed to further strong growth in dwelling investment in the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead. Members noted that there had been ongoing divergence in conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testablished housing markets across the country, as well as between houses and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapartments. Housing prices had continued to rise rapidly in Sydney and to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlesser extent in Melbourne. Elsewhere, there had been little change in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices over the past six months or so. Prices of apartments had been growing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless rapidly than those of houses, which members considered to be consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the relatively strong growth in the supply of higher-density housing in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany capital cities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in housing credit overall had been stable over recent months at around 7 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent on an annualised basis, while growth in lending to investors had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteady at a bit above 10 per cent. Members observed that the household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt-to-income ratio, calculated by netting funds held in mortgage offset accounts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom total household debt to the financial sector, had increased over the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto March but had not exceeded previous peaks. Members discussed the fact that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh housing prices had different implications for existing home owners, who\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefited from increased wealth, and potential new home owners, who were finding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit more difficult to finance a home purchase.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestment in both the mining and non-mining sectors appeared to have fallen in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch quarter, although the split between the two components remained subject\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto some uncertainty. Profits for non-mining firms had increased by 6 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the past year. More recent survey measures of business conditions,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence and capacity utilisation had picked up to be around, or even above,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir long-run averages.

Coal exports had been affected by the severe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstorms in the Hunter region of New South Wales in late April. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there had been further signs of growth in service exports, in part a response\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the depreciation of the exchange rate. Over the past year, net service exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad made a similar contribution to output growth as exports of iron ore, even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough total import volumes had increased in the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour force data indicated further signs of improvement in May. Employment growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad picked up over the year to exceed the rate of population growth. As a result,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rate had been relatively stable since the latter part of 2014\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had fallen slightly in May to 6 per cent. Members observed that employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been strongest in household services and that employment and vacancies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been growing for business services but had remained little changed in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoods sector. As with other state-based indicators, employment growth and job\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvacancies had been strongest in New South Wales and Victoria. Forward-looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market indicators had been somewhat mixed over recent months. The ABS\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasure of firms' job vacancies overall suggested that demand for labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould be sufficient to maintain a stable or even falling unemployment rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the near term, while other forward-looking indicators suggested only modest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in employment in coming months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the latest estimates indicated that the population had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby 1.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter, down from a peak\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate of growth of 1.8 per cent over 2012. The slower growth was primarily\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounted for by a decline in net immigration, which was particularly pronounced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Western Australia and Queensland, consistent with weaker economic conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin those states. Members observed that the lower-than-expected growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation helped to reconcile the below-average growth in output over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast year with a broadly steady unemployment rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite recent improvements in labour market indicators, members reflected that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas still evidence of spare capacity in the labour market.

The ‘no’ vote\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the referendum on the creditors' latest proposals raised several issues,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst among which was how the Greek authorities could reopen the banks. A critical\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvulnerability in the near term was related to whether the European Central\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank would provide additional emergency liquidity assistance. A second issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas how Greece would be able to service its external debt and a third was the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenges faced by the Greek authorities in improving the competitive position\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the economy. Although these issues were of great concern to the Greek populace,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe direct economic implications for the global economy and Australia were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassessed by members to be relatively limited. They noted that the reaction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof financial markets to these developments had been fairly muted. This was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the economic and financial exposures to Greece – apart\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the official sector's financial exposure – being quite low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that spreads to 10-year German Bunds on comparable bonds issued by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly, Spain and Portugal had not risen much, with the limited contagion from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in Greece likely to have reflected a general view of markets that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious adjustment policies in those countries had been relatively successful.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers then turned their discussion to developments in bond markets more generally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYields on longer-maturity German Bunds and US Treasuries had risen sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the first half of June, with German 10-year yields reaching\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 per cent, compared with a historic low of 8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis points in mid April. German yields declined somewhat following the announcement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Greek referendum.

Although commentary by Federal Reserve officials suggested that it could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe a little sooner than that, they continued to emphasise that the exact timing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the first increase would be less important than the pace of subsequent increases,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were expected to be gradual.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe People's Bank of China (PBC) eased monetary policy further in June by cutting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenchmark deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points, citing low inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a consequent increase in real interest rates. In addition, the PBC announced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcuts to the reserve requirement ratio for selected financial institutions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese authorities had also announced a proposal to allow banks more flexibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin their choice of funding mix and asset allocation, which could lead to an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in the supply of credit over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 3.25\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent, citing the decline in New Zealand's terms of trade and the disinflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect of stronger-than-expected labour force growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity markets fell by 3 per cent over the course of June, with broad-based\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls and price movements generally tending to reflect fluctuations in sentiment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout Greece.

Much of the volatility had occurred in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequity markets, with fixed income and foreign exchange markets generally exhibiting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless volatility.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the implications of the changes in mid August to the manner in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the People's Bank of China (PBC) set the daily fixing rate for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenminbi (RMB) against the US dollar, which had resulted in that exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciating by around 4½ per cent over the course of a few days. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese authorities had indicated that the intention of the change was to make\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe RMB more market based. While the resulting depreciation of the RMB spot\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate against the US dollar was the largest since 1994, it was not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of line with short-term movements sometimes seen between the major freely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfloating currencies. Members noted that the depreciation had offset only a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle of the sizeable appreciation of the RMB in trade-weighted terms that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad occurred over the previous year in the face of a slowing Chinese economy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the RMB had appreciated in line with the US dollar over that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter the initial depreciation, the RMB had been relatively stable against the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar. Members noted that the Chinese authorities had for some time been selling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeign exchange reserves to prevent the RMB from depreciating against the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar in the face of significant capital outflows. This contrasted with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe experience in the previous decade, during which foreign reserves had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccumulated to limit the appreciation of the RMB in the face of capital inflows.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that it was not clear which assets the Chinese authorities had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsold as part of the recent intervention nor which assets were being bought\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby those taking capital out of China, but given the potential size of these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflows, their effects on asset markets could be large.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo counter the liquidity drain from sales of foreign exchange reserves following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe foreign exchange intervention, the PBC had reduced reserve requirements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton Chinese banks by another 50 basis points in late August. The PBC had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso lowered its benchmark lending and deposit rates by a further 25 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe depreciation of the RMB had had an immediate effect across much of Asia, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany Asian currencies depreciating and some central banks in the region reportedly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintervening to stabilise their currencies. The Australian dollar had depreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong with the RMB, but had quickly rebounded within a day or so. A few days\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater the Australian dollar fell very briefly to US$0.705, during a short-lived\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod of dislocation in foreign exchange markets. Over the course of August,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Australian dollar depreciated by 2½ per cent against the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar and by 1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The euro and yen had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth appreciated notably against the US dollar over this period. The appreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the euro was somewhat at odds with other movements in financial prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut appeared to reflect the closing out of carry trades that had been funded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin euro.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity prices experienced large swings over August and in net terms had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply, mainly reflecting heightened concerns about China.

As noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat previous Board meetings, it was possible that the first increase in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfederal funds rate in around nine years could have significant effects on financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets despite the fact that it had been well telegraphed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, in stark contrast to the large movements in equity prices, yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton 10-year US Treasuries had changed little in net terms during the recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod of equity market volatility. Australian bond yields had moved broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin line with US yields. Bond yields in some emerging markets, including Brazil,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndonesia and Malaysia, had risen sharply, but in others, such as Mexico, they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere little changed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market pricing indicated that the domestic cash rate was expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunchanged at the current meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that growth in the GDP of Australia's major trading partners had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teased in the June quarter as a result of weaker conditions in Japan and other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teast Asian economies, but remained close to its long-run average. Growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production, including in China, had eased further over recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile economic conditions in the United States and the euro area continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto improve. Globally, core inflation had generally been stable, but at levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the targets of most central banks, and monetary conditions remained very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative.

Members also observed that growth in retail sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been relatively stable and monthly data contained relatively little information\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout service sectors, which were becoming increasingly important for growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Chinese economy. Growth in fixed asset investment had continued to decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, although conditions in some segments of the property sector had improved,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was likely to be some time before the existing stock of newly constructed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwellings was sold and residential property investment picked up. Production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof many industrial products, including steel, had declined since the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, but iron ore imports from Australia had nonetheless continued to increase.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInflation remained below the central bank's target level, which provided\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscope for further policy easing should that be required. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe recent volatility in Chinese equity markets was not expected to have a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant direct effect on the near-term economic outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, output contracted in the June quarter and core inflation had remained steady.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile inflation was still below the Bank of Japan's 2 per cent target,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit had increased over the past two years and was likely to continue to be underpinned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby further modest growth in base wages, which in turn reflected very tight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market conditions. GDP growth had fallen in other east Asian economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter, with trade volumes contracting and business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth slowing. Some of the weakness in trade values could be attributed to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls in intra-regional trade, part of which owed to the effect of lower oil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices.

Growth in household consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad picked up to an above-average pace over the year to the June quarter, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in business investment had eased, in part reflecting weaker conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the oil sector.

GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to remain below average in year-ended terms, but members recognised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a number of indicators of domestic economic activity had shown some improvement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers began their discussion of the recent economic data by considering indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof business conditions. Surveys of business conditions generally had shown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther improvement over recent months and conditions were clearly above average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels in the household and business service sectors. Although survey measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that business profits had increased to above-average levels, ABS\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata showed that, relative to nominal GDP, mining profits had declined further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing falls in commodity prices and non-mining profits had remained relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstable.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ABS capital expenditure survey had suggested a further fall in mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter and investment intentions in that sector implied a further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsizeable fall in 2015/16, which was consistent with the Bank's current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts. Members discussed the implications of the recent emphasis on cost\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcutting in the mining sector, noting that it would probably lead to mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment eventually stabilising at a lower level than had previously been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected. The capital expenditure survey also pointed to a decline in non-mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in 2015/16, but by less than implied by the survey taken three months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier. Approvals for non-residential building also remained weak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that differences in business conditions across the services and goods-related\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors of the economy were apparent in surveys as well as a range of other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of activity. In particular, above-average conditions in the household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand business service sectors were consistent with the growth in employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand investment in those sectors. In contrast, although surveys of business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had improved for sectors related to the production and distribution\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof goods to be at around average levels, employment and investment in those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustries had been little changed for some time. In addition, firms in these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustries had indicated that they expected further falls in their overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment over the year ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that recent indicators of consumer sentiment and retail sales had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen consistent with some increase in consumption growth. They also noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the housing market overall had remained strong and that housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice inflation nationally had risen since the beginning of the year, notwithstanding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregional disparities. In particular, the strength in housing price inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, mainly for detached houses,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereas housing price inflation had been modest in other parts of the country\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand negative in some market segments.

Forward-looking indicators of labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had been mixed; some were consistent with the unemployment rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining around current levels or even falling a little, while others pointed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a slight rise over coming months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndicators of wage inflation in the June quarter remained soft.

The weakening in Chinese economic activity combined with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in Chinese financial markets had led to sharp declines in global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequity prices. So far, this volatility had not impaired the functioning of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother financial markets and funding remained readily available to creditworthy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tborrowers. Moreover, several recent policy measures designed to support activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin China had not yet had their full effect. Economic conditions in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates and euro area had continued to improve, monetary policies globally remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery stimulatory and lower oil prices would support economic activity in most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Australia's trading partners. Overall, international economic developments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased the downside risks to the outlook, but it was too early to assess\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe extent to which this would materially alter the forecast for GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia's trading partners to be around average over the next couple\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, the national accounts were expected to show that output growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen weak in the June quarter, following a strong outcome in the March quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly as a result of temporarily lower resource exports.

Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat growth in global trade was subdued, although it had picked up a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently. They discussed the implications of the general slowdown in trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand industrial production growth, notably in Asia, including for commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices. In particular, iron ore prices had declined slightly over September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut remained higher than earlier in the year, while oil prices had edged higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom their recent lows. Globally, core inflation had generally remained low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand at rates below the targets of most central banks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, indicators of activity for July and August had suggested further moderation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin growth. Members noted that growth in fixed asset investment and industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction had eased over 2015. This had been particularly noticeable in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnorth-eastern provinces of China where activity was more concentrated in heavy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry and mining. The output of key industrial products, including steel,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas lower than in late 2014, partly as a result of weak residential construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity, even though both residential property prices and sales had been higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan earlier in the year.

Real GDP had declined in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe June quarter, while conditions in the labour market had remained tight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand nominal wages had continued to increase modestly. Inflation remained low,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough the Bank of Japan continued to forecast that it would reach the 2 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent target by mid 2016. Elsewhere in east Asia, below-average growth appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have continued into the second half of 2015 and remained a source of concern\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the strength of the global economy. A slowdown in industrial production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in the region had become increasingly apparent over recent months and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports had declined in Korea, Singapore and Taiwan in August. In India, growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter had been driven by robust domestic demand and inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained relatively low in August.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast to the situation in much of Asia, growth in the US economy had picked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup to an above-average pace in mid 2015. Recent indicators pointed to further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption-led strength in the September quarter. Labour market conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad improved and the unemployment rate had edged lower in August to be close\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto most estimates of full employment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the euro area, timely indicators suggested that the gradual recovery in the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued in the second half of 2015, supported by both external and domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand.

They noted that, as expected, GDP had increased only slightly following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strong growth recorded in the March quarter. The weakness in the June quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad reflected temporary, weather-related disruptions to resource exports as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as the ongoing decline in mining investment. Members noted that overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was expected to have strengthened in the September quarter, with indications\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof growth in resource exports and dwelling investment. Members also observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat employment growth had strengthened despite GDP growth over the year having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen at the lower end of the forecast range of a year earlier.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumption growth had been relatively steady at a below-average pace for the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, although this was stronger than in 2013. Household income was estimated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have increased by a little less than consumption over the past year, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta modest decline in the household saving ratio. Members noted that the strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof wealth effects on consumption behaviour would affect whether the saving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratio would continue to trend down over the next year or so. While the year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in retail sales had been little changed in recent months, surveys of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds' perceptions of their personal financial situation compared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a year earlier remained above average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling investment had increased strongly over the year to June, despite recording\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta decline in the June quarter. Building approvals had declined a little from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir recent peak, but remained at levels that implied further growth in dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment, albeit at a gradually declining rate. Loan approvals for construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof new dwellings had also fallen over the past year. Growth in housing prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney appeared to have eased slightly in recent months and auction clearance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates in Sydney and Melbourne had declined a little from their recent peaks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, it was too early to be confident that these signs of slowing in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice inflation would be sustained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn relation to lending for housing, members noted that the data on the split of lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto owner-occupiers and investors were of questionable quality at present. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavailable data suggested that there had been a modest decline in the growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof credit extended to investors in housing of late, which was consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tightening in banks' lending standards in response to actions of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). With housing credit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverall remaining steady over the past year, there had reportedly been a slight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in the growth of housing credit to owner-occupiers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMining investment had continued to fall in the June quarter and now accounted for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 5 per cent of nominal GDP, down from a peak of around 8 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent. Members noted that there had been a correspondingly significant decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin capital imports. In addition, profits of mining firms had fallen sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past year, in line with lower commodity prices. Mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to continue to fall over the next couple of years as the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpipeline of work was completed, but resource export volumes, particularly for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliquefied natural gas, were expected to increase substantially over the same\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-mining investment was estimated to have picked up a little in the June quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had risen modestly over the past year. Over the same period, profits of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining companies had kept pace with nominal GDP. Survey measures of business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had increased to be further above their long-run averages, notably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the household and business services sectors. Conditions in the goods production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand distribution sectors, though weaker than in some other sectors, had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshown improvement of late. Members noted that the depreciation of the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate had led to an increase in exports of services, including tourism, as well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a noticeable decline in imports of services.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth had strengthened to be 2 per cent over the year to August and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipation rate had increased. The unemployment rate had remained in its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6–6¼ per cent range over recent months. Forward-looking indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad generally been consistent with the unemployment rate being around its current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel or possibly slightly lower in the months ahead. Measures of earnings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand productivity growth from the national accounts had remained soft in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune quarter, with negligible growth in either measure over the past year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, unit labour costs had been little changed for around four years, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers saw as helping to explain the stronger-than-expected growth in employment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the improvement in labour demand had been concentrated in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold and business service sectors of the economy. This was consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the data on business conditions and output growth by industry. In contrast,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment in goods-related sectors had been little changed for some time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the differences in the nature of the investment and employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequired in the services sector relative to goods-related industries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe discussion of financial markets commenced with the observation that the two major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrivers of markets over the past month continued to be concerns about Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, and the implications for the global economy, as well as the timing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the first increase in the federal funds rate in the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left monetary policy unchanged at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits September meeting, citing concerns about global growth, a majority of FOMC\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers had indicated nonetheless that they still expect to start raising the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfederal funds rate before the end of this year. Market expectations immediately\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprior to the FOMC meeting implied a one-in-three chance of a rate rise occurring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the September meeting and a very high probability of a rate rise by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the year. Following the meeting, however, market expectations changed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly, with an increase in the federal funds rate by the end of this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear given only a 50 per cent chance of occurring and markets not fully\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpricing in a rate rise until April next year at the earliest. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat some market participants did not expect an increase in the policy rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the foreseeable future.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBond yields in the major markets had declined in net terms over September. In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States and Germany, 10-year government bond yields had risen in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst half of the month, mainly in response to some better-than-expected US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic data, before declining following the Fed's decision to leave the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfederal funds rate unchanged. Yields on Australian Government Securities had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoved broadly in line with global yields over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe changed exchange rate arrangements in China in August had initially led to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the renminbi, but the exchange rate had appreciated slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the course of September. Members noted that there had been a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in Chinese foreign currency reserves since mid 2014, with apparent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsizeable sales or non-reinvestment of maturities of US bonds. Following the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the renminbi in August, sales of reserves were likely to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued in response to net private capital outflows. A significant share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof private capital outflows over the past year appeared to have been in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tform of increased foreign currency bank deposits. The Chinese authorities had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannounced that existing restrictions on private capital outflows would be more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trigorously enforced.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial market conditions in a number of emerging market economies had deteriorated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther in recent months, reflecting lower commodity prices and country-specific\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks, especially for Brazil, Russia and Turkey, where yields on local currency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdenominated sovereign bonds had increased noticeably. In contrast, developments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some other emerging markets, notably India and Mexico, continued to be relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenign. Corporate bond issuance in emerging markets in aggregate had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply in the September quarter. This had been accompanied with significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutflows from both emerging market bond and equity investment funds since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddle of the year. The currencies of some emerging market economies had depreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther over the past month and some Asian currencies were back to the lows\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecorded around the time of the financial crisis in the late 1990s.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US dollar was unchanged on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe exchange rates of most other advanced economies had been little changed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had depreciated marginally to be around its recent lows\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEquity prices had fluctuated around the lower levels reached in late August in many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies as well as in China, with some large daily movements in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth directions. News of the Volkswagen emissions scandal in late September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadversely affected European equities, while equity prices in emerging markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad partly recovered from their falls in late August, although they remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than at the start of the year.

Partly in reaction to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, financial market volatility had picked up following a lengthy period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof low volatility and compressed risk premia. Members noted the possibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a sharp repricing in markets where investors for years had been ‘searching\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor yield’.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that domestic sources of risk to financial stability in Australia continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto revolve mainly around developments in local property markets. In the context\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof recent developments in the housing market and household credit, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the findings from the enhanced scrutiny of housing lending practices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundertaken by APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the end of 2014. This scrutiny and related work had shown that investor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity was considerably higher – and lending standards in some parts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the market weaker – than had originally been thought.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers further observed that the risks in commercial property and the property development\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector were rising. Building approvals for new apartments remained very strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover 2015, even though rental markets appeared soft in some areas. The divergence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween commercial property valuations and rents had widened further, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong domestic and foreign investor interest for new and existing office buildings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin particular, even though vacancy rates were quite high. At the same time,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalling commodity prices were weighing on the profitability of many resource-related\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanies. The rest of the business sector seemed to be in relatively good\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshape, in contrast, with both gearing and failure rates at relatively low levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were also briefed on the risks in the New Zealand housing market and dairy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, given the sizeable exposures of Australian banks through their New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tZealand subsidiaries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile Australian banks continued to perform well, they were taking steps to enhance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir resilience. Banks' asset performance continued to improve, profitability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained high, and the large banks had raised substantial amounts of capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin advance of forthcoming prudential requirements. Most banks had strengthened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe serviceability metrics used in their mortgage lending and taken steps to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslow the pace of growth in investor lending towards the prudential regulator's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations. Banks were also reportedly becoming increasingly wary of lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto property developers in markets that were thought to be at risk of becoming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toversupplied. Nonetheless, competition among lenders had intensified in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\towner-occupied segment of the housing market and had continued to do so in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of the business lending market. Members observed that a key challenge\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be to ensure that lending standards at both Australian and foreign-owned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks did not weaken from this point.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that recent data continued to raise concerns about the outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic growth in China in particular and east Asia more generally, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic activity in the United States and euro area continued to recover.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBelow-average growth in the Asian region had been most evident in weak growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin industrial production, which had been mirrored in lower export volumes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile global commodity prices had fallen over the past year, they had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle changed over recent months. Global financial conditions remained very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative and low oil prices were expected to continue to provide a measure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof support to growth in Australia's major trading partners.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, the moderate expansion of the economy had continued, although GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter was low, in line with expectations, reflecting what appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be temporary weakness in resource exports as well as further falls in mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment. GDP growth had been below average over the past year, but there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been further evidence of rebalancing from the resources sector towards\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-mining activity. This rebalancing was being increasingly supported by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the Australian dollar, which had led to a noticeable increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin net service exports over the past year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that reductions in the cash rate earlier in the year continued to provide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport to aggregate demand, particularly dwelling investment and household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption.

The outlook for the Asian region,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly China, remained one of the key uncertainties in forecasting global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. Core inflation had generally been steady in both the advanced and emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies at rates below central banks' targets, while monetary conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobally were likely to be more accommodative than previously expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe slowdown in growth in Asia had been associated with lower growth in global trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolumes and industrial production, as well as further modest falls in commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices. Nevertheless, members noted that the outlook for Australia's terms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof trade was little changed. One upside risk for commodity prices was the possibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof high-cost producers, particularly in China, cutting production in response\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the already lower commodity prices. A downside risk stemmed from the possibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof weaker growth in global demand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that growth in the services sector in China had held up over the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the September quarter, but that growth in the industrial sector had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly owing to ongoing weakness in residential construction. Although residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproperty prices had increased a little in recent months, sales had retraced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of the increase seen earlier in the year. Furthermore, a substantial inventory\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof unsold residential property in many smaller cities suggested that it could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe some time before there was a pick-up in construction activity. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the ongoing process of urbanisation would help to support demand for residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproperty in the longer term, notwithstanding projections of a gradual decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the Chinese working-age population. Meanwhile, growth in exports of Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteel had supported domestic crude steel production despite subdued domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteel demand. In response to moderating economic growth and disinflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures apparent in producer price indices and the GDP deflator, the People's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of China (PBC) had eased monetary policy further.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to other parts of Asia, the economic recovery in Japan appeared to have lost\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmomentum around the middle of the year, although the labour market had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttight and nominal wages had been growing moderately. To some extent, the tightness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the labour market reflected a fall in the supply of available workers associated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith an ageing population. Members noted that other high-income economies in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe region, including Korea, would face similar demographic challenges. Although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcore inflation in Japan had increased over the past couple of years, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved that the Bank of Japan expected inflation to reach its 2 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget around six months later than had previously been anticipated. In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest of east Asia, softening external demand had led to slower growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past year and there were signs that domestic demand had also eased in most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies in the region. India was a notable exception, where growth in domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand had remained strong and had been supported by a further easing in monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that growth in domestic demand in the United States had been sustained,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough recorded GDP growth had moderated in the September quarter following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong growth in the preceding quarter. Members observed that consumption growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained robust, supported by further improvement in labour market conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWage growth had picked up in the September quarter, following a relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak outcome in June, to be around rates of recent years in year-ended terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the core inflation rate was steady, but below the Federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve's target.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data suggested that the euro area economy had been growing above trend and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rate continued to fall modestly, although members acknowledged\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there had been considerable diversity in outcomes across countries.

Members noted that the forecasts for GDP growth were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot materially different from those presented three months earlier. Growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to be between 2–3 per cent over the year to June 2016,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore rising to 2¾–3¾ per cent over the year to June 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe forecast for GDP growth towards the end of the forecast period had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevised down slightly to incorporate information about minor delays to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommencement of production at some large liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that recent data had indicated that consumption growth was likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave continued at a moderate pace in the September quarter. Growth in retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales values had been little changed in year-ended terms, survey measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds' perceptions of their personal finances had remained above average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand motor vehicle sales had risen strongly. Household consumption was forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto contribute significantly to expenditure growth over the next couple of years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by low interest rates and relatively strong employment growth. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold saving ratio was still expected to decline gradually over the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, as income growth was expected to pick up only slowly from recent low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates. Members noted that households' decisions about consumption and saving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to represent an important source of uncertainty for the forecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, the low level of interest rates continued to support the housing market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForward-looking indicators of housing activity generally pointed to further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in dwelling investment, albeit at a moderating rate. Auction clearance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates and housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne had declined over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths. Lending standards by banks had been tightened in response to changes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin supervisory measures announced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and a number\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof lenders had announced increases in mortgage rates for both investors and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers. Notwithstanding questions over the accuracy of the components\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof housing credit data, overall housing credit growth had increased a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent months, with growth in lending to investors in housing easing slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that for owner-occupiers apparently picking up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data indicated that survey measures of business conditions in the non-mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector had remained clearly above their long-run average levels, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor services. Support provided to the economy following the depreciation of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe exchange rate was particularly apparent in the sizeable contribution to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth from net service exports over the year to date. Growth in net service\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports was expected to continue to boost growth in output over the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod. These developments had been accompanied by significant growth in employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the services sector but, given that parts of that sector tend to be less\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital-intensive, there had been little effect on investment from the strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof business conditions. The stock of non-residential building work yet to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone had fallen further in the June quarter but was still around its decade-average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a share of GDP, and approvals for new work remained low. Business credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had picked up in September after easing over most of 2015. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the ongoing improvement in domestic demand, together with the increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetitiveness from the lower exchange rate, were expected to lead to a pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin non-mining business investment in the second half of the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, there remained considerable uncertainty surrounding the strength and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttiming of this recovery.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMining investment was expected to continue to decline over the forecast period, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe decline expected largely to have run its course by the end of 2017. Mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was expected to make the largest subtraction from demand of around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1½ percentage points in 2015/16, although the effect on GDP would be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat less than this after accounting for the large share of imports used\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin mining investment. Resource exports looked to have rebounded in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, following earlier disruptions from adverse weather and some unanticipated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshutdowns of LNG facilities. LNG exports were expected to ramp up over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder of the forecast period, albeit with some minor delays relative to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations in August.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth had been stronger than expected over 2015 and this had been accompanied\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby a noticeable increase in the participation rate. Employment growth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcentrated in the household and business services sectors. Measures of job\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvacancies and advertisements pointed to continued growth in employment in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths ahead. The unemployment rate, after being steady at around 6–6¼ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent for more than a year, was expected to remain around this elevated level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some time before declining gradually. Members observed that the relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh unemployment rate and low growth of wages pointed to a degree of spare\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity in the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CPI data for the September quarter indicated that underlying inflation had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a bit above ¼ per cent in the quarter and to 2–2¼\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent in year-ended terms. The CPI had increased by 0.1 per cent in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter (in seasonally adjusted terms) and by 1.5 per cent over the year. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow year-ended outcome in part reflected the earlier decline in fuel prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a decline in utility prices in the September quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile quarterly inflation remained subject to a degree of volatility and measurement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\terror, the broad-based nature of the low outcome in the September quarter suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat inflationary pressures were a bit more subdued than expected. The profile\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor underlying inflation had been revised down consequently. Underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now expected to be close to 2 per cent in year-ended terms over the course\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof most of the next year, before picking up to around 2½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the second half of the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNon-tradables inflation had declined in the September quarter, suggesting that domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflationary pressures were well contained and consistent with low growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour costs and moderate demand growth. Falls in regulated utility prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some states had also contributed. Inflation in new dwelling costs had eased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the quarter, but had increased over the past couple of years, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney, in line with the continued high level of residential construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) were little changed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth in the September quarter and over the past year. Members noted data showing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate had led to higher Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar prices for imports, but that the effect of this on final consumer prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been tempered by heightened competitive pressures, consistent with information\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived from liaison. Nevertheless, gradual pass-through of the exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation was still expected to place some upward pressure on the prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof tradable items over the next several years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers opened their discussion of financial markets by observing that the key influence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month had been changing expectations about the policy settings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the major central banks.

The slowdown in Asia had been more persistent than earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipated and had contributed to lower commodity prices, along with increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply of commodities, including from Australia. The terms of trade for Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined further. Monetary policy was accommodative in many economies and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe low level of oil prices was expected to support growth in Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor trading partners over the next few years.

The very low level of interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas supporting growth in household consumption and dwelling investment. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taddition, the Australian dollar was adjusting to the significant declines in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkey commodity prices and boosting demand for domestic production. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen most evident in the services sector, which had experienced strong employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth over the past year. While measures of non-mining investment intentions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained subdued, surveys of business conditions had strengthened to above-average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels. These factors suggested that the prospects for an improvement in economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had firmed a little over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, the forecast for the Australian economy remained for growth to strengthen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually over the next two years as the drag on GDP growth from falling mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment waned and activity progressively shifted to non-mining sectors of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy. However, members recognised that there was still evidence of spare\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity, including the relatively high unemployment rate, low wage growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the lower-than-expected inflation outcome in the September quarter. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradual nature of the pick-up in domestic growth suggested that spare capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould persist for some time.

Credit growth had increased a little over recent months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand housing prices had risen further in Melbourne and Sydney, though the pace\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof growth had moderated and housing prices were steady in other cities.

Overall,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe recovery from the global recession was continuing. The IMF had recently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupgraded its world growth forecast for 2010 to 3.9 per cent, from 3.1 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin October. There had been significant revisions for the United States, China\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand India, but more modest revisions for the euro area. The Bank's staff\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also revised up their world growth forecasts for 2010, though only modestly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas their forecasts had already been significantly higher than those of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIMF.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile growth had resumed in the major advanced economies, there was significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspare capacity and measures of core inflation were gradually falling. Labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets were very weak, although there were some signs of stabilisation in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe United States. US GDP had grown by 1.4 per cent in the December quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was stronger than expected. There was a significant contribution from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inventory cycle. GDP data for the United Kingdom were also available, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe preliminary estimate showing growth of 0.1 per cent in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, after six straight declines.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in the advanced economies was currently being supported by the inventory\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcycle and stimulatory policy settings. At the household level, there was growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin spending in the United States and Japan, but spending continued to contract\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin many European economies. Members discussed this trend, which reflected weak\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome growth and rising household saving rates in some of the larger European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. The latter appeared to reflect weak consumer sentiment, broader\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty about economic prospects, and – in some economies –\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcern about high public debt levels. Regarding investment spending, there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a slight increase in the United States in the December quarter, after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta decline of more than 20 per cent over the previous five quarters. As\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyet, there was limited evidence of a pick-up in investment in the euro area\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor Japan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that one particular challenge facing many of the advanced economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the growth in public debt. From the point of view of long-run fiscal sustainability,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis needed to be checked, but tightening fiscal policy at an early stage could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundermine economic recovery. Concerns about fiscal issues had recently focused\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton Greece, which had entered the crisis with relatively high public debt and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad seen its budget deficit rise to 13 per cent of GDP in 2009.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe issues were quite different in Asia (outside of Japan), where growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly stronger and unemployment was falling in the higher-income economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese growth was estimated to have been around 2¼ per cent in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter and 10¾ per cent over the year. There was evidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof some rebalancing in growth, with a fall in fixed-asset investment through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe quarter after a sharp run-up earlier in the year. Export volumes had grown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly over the past few quarters, with an even larger pick-up in imports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElsewhere in east Asia, exports and industrial production had grown very strongly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin late 2009.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile growth had picked up across most of Asia and core inflation had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– albeit from low levels – financial conditions in many economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained quite stimulatory. Authorities in a number of economies were taking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteps to slow lending, including via increased reserve ratios on banks, a tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof lending criteria such as maximum loan-to-value ratios, and – in China\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– directives to slow lending. Members noted that it was difficult to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalibrate such measures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn balance, the domestic data in the two months since the previous meeting suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta gradual strengthening in economic activity and a continuation of the slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin underlying inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe GDP data for the September quarter were difficult to read, and had indeed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen reissued to correct some errors. While they suggested a slowing in growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto only 0.2 per cent in the September quarter, the trend data showed a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradual strengthening in growth through the first three quarters of 2009, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas more consistent with other data on the economy. Overall, the economy was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testimated to have expanded by 1.5 per cent over the first three quarters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard members noted some significant upward revisions to GDP growth over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear to the June quarter 2007, which made the employment and output data for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat period more consistent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data on the labour market had been quite strong. Employment was estimated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have grown solidly in December, with 135,000 new jobs in the last four months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2009. There had been a resumption of growth in full-time employment and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso a pick-up in average hours worked. The unemployment rate had fallen to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5.5 per cent and it now appeared that the peak in the unemployment rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen around 5¾ per cent. Board members noted that the decline in average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thours during the slowdown was likely to have prevented a significantly larger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in unemployment than actually occurred, and reflected the greater\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market flexibility that had resulted from labour market reforms over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past 25 years or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard members discussed trends in the household sector. Consumer confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas high, partly reflecting the improving labour market and continuing gains\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin household wealth. The ABS retail trade data were available only up to November.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile these had been quite strong, a range of reports suggested that spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover December and January had been more mixed. Based on liaison and public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treports, it appeared that sales through the early part of December had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak, with some subsequent improvement.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe housing market remained fairly buoyant, with private-sector measures suggesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice growth of 10–12 per cent over 2009 and the ABS measure of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices of detached houses having risen by slightly more. Prices appeared to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave levelled out in late 2009 in lower-priced suburbs, consistent with reduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand following the winding back of the higher grants to first-home buyers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLoan approvals had declined in November and were estimated to have fallen further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin December, perhaps indicating initial reactions to the tightening of policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurveys suggested that business conditions remained firm, though the NAB survey,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich became available during the meeting, suggested a significant fall in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness confidence back to around average levels. Other survey data suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat businesses remained fairly cautious in their spending plans. Nevertheless,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven after the falls in investment spending over the past year, investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained high as a share of GDP, and it was projected to increase further as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in the resources sector picked up over coming years. Members again\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed developments in the flow of finance to the business sector, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained weak. However, the weakness in bank lending had been partly offset\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby increased funding from the capital markets, and it appeared also to reflect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe desire of some firms to reduce their leverage. Financing for the private\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction sector remained weak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe consumer price data for the December quarter had been in line with staff\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations. Underlying inflation was gradually declining, and was around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3¼ per cent on a year-ended basis and around 0.6 per cent in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. The appreciation of the exchange rate in early 2009 had contributed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a decline in tradables prices in the quarter. Non-tradables inflation (excluding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeposit and loan facilities) was well below the peak levels of 2008, but remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh relative to its average rate over the inflation-targeting period. Year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCPI inflation was 2.1 per cent, after a couple of quarters when it had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow 2 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the revised staff forecasts, which were based on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassumption of a gradual rise in the cash rate over the forecast period. Year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP was forecast to strengthen through 2010 to a rate of 3¼–3½ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the remainder of the forecast period. Growth in the mining sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to be significantly stronger, partly reflecting the expected growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the LNG sector and upward revisions to expected coal and iron ore prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth outside of the resources sector was expected to be more subdued. Higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices meant that the forecast for the terms of trade in the coming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear had been revised up significantly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYear-ended underlying inflation was expected to decline further through 2010\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto around or just below 2½ per cent, reflecting the earlier slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin demand and wages and the appreciation of the exchange rate through 2009.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInflation was expected to pick up a little thereafter, to around 2¾\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent by the end of the forecast period, as the expansion continued and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effects of the appreciation faded.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial markets had generally consolidated over the previous two months, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sources of tension shifting from banking systems to sovereign risk.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe turmoil over Dubai's debt problems, which had been discussed at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious meeting, had quietened following support from Abu Dhabi.

However, most of the market liquidity support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprograms of the major central banks had generally been allowed to run down:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Federal Reserve had announced the cessation of many of its programs on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 February, and asset purchases in the United States and United Kingdom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere at, or nearing, completion. The Bank of Japan was the exception, having\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased its provision of liquidity.

There had been two large issues of government-guaranteed debt in December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas banks responded to inquiries by investors, but most of the issuance in January\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been unguaranteed. Unguaranteed issuance remained cheaper for the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks, except at quite long maturities. Issuance of Kangaroo bonds (Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar issues by offshore issuers) had been strong recently, taking advantage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the favourable cross-currency basis swap spread for such issuers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the signs of improvement in the domestic securitisation market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed at the previous meeting had continued.

There were some tentative signs that parts of the housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket were seeing the effect of the decline in assistance to first home-buyers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand higher interest rates, though high-end housing values were continuing to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease. Overall, there had been a slight upward revision to the growth forecasts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade at the time of the November 2009 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latest prices data had shown that underlying inflation was falling in line\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith earlier forecasts, while headline CPI inflation had risen from low levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the temporary factors that had been holding it down abated. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the forecasts were for further declines in the year-ended rate of underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation, though the expected trough in inflation had been revised up slightly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNonetheless, inflation would be consistent with the target over the next year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor so and, conditional on the assumption of a gradual further increase in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate, was forecast to remain so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the level of interest rates, members noted that the three increases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cash rate late in 2009, together with the widening in the margins between\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate and many lending rates, had meant a material adjustment to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstance of monetary policy. Members judged that monetary conditions were no\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger exceptionally accommodative, though the structure of interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas still somewhat below average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs at the previous meeting, members considered the policy considerations to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe finely balanced. Members expected that, if economic conditions continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto improve as expected, further increases in the cash rate were likely to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessary. But they did not regard that outlook as requiring an increase at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevery meeting, and they saw the earlier moves to begin withdrawing monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulus promptly as affording the Board a degree of flexibility in its subsequent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecisions. This allowed the possibility of waiting to receive some more information\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton how the economy was responding to the monetary tightening that had already\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccurred. Such a course would also allow time to monitor events overseas.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that many market participants expected a further increase in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate at this meeting. They concluded that, on balance, the stronger case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas to leave the cash rate unchanged for the time being. This decision would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe accompanied by communication that, if economic conditions evolved broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas expected, further adjustments to policy would probably be needed over time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto ensure that inflation remained consistent with the target over the medium\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.75 per cent.</p>"]}},

Public demand, especially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic investment spending, was estimated to have been very strong in the quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMachinery and equipment spending had also grown strongly, partly reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tax incentives that expired at the end of December 2009, and there had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen continuing growth in household spending and export volumes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed developments in the labour market, where there had been a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther rise in employment and fall in the unemployment rate in January.

It\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow appeared that the peak unemployment rate in the recent downturn had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequal to around the low point in the previous three cycles.

Surveys showed business confidence and hiring plans\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be relatively high, but also suggested a degree of caution in many businesses'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment plans. This was consistent with the recent ABS Capital Expenditure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey, which suggested that investment outside of the mining sector was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto remain relatively subdued. In contrast, expectations for mining sector investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpointed to further increases from current already high levels.

More generally, banks were now reporting greater\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twillingness to lend to businesses and there were fewer reports from firms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery tight credit conditions, while liaison indicated falls in risk margins\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaid by some borrowers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe retail trade data had suggested relatively subdued sales in December but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolid growth in January.

Building approvals in December and January\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere running at a relatively high level compared with the past year, but at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta rate that was below the levels of previous peaks in home-building. Data for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing loan approvals had declined somewhat recently, consistent with what\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad occurred in previous episodes of monetary policy tightening. The recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls were concentrated in approvals to owner-occupiers, with approvals to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors increasing, particularly in Victoria.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been no new data on consumer price inflation over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the data for the wage price index for the December quarter indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat growth in private-sector wages had remained quite low, while public-sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twage growth had remained firm.

Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreece did not account for a large proportion of the global sovereign debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket; rather, the main risk was the possibility of contagion to other sovereigns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand perhaps other markets, primarily in the euro area.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYields in the major bond markets had been little changed over the past month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcept in the case of the United Kingdom, where they had drifted up a little.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe developments in Greece had initially led to a small rise in spreads on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerging market bond yields, but these had since narrowed again. European corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond spreads had been little affected. Australian government bond yields had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen relatively steady over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe effect of the sovereign risk concerns on foreign exchange markets had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore marked. There had been a significant depreciation of the euro over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast two months, though on a trade-weighted basis the euro remained at a relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level.

The main themes were that conditions in the US and European financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystems had improved significantly since the depths of the crisis but were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill far from normal, while the Australian financial system had remained resilient.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBanks in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and the euro area were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearning only modest profits in aggregate, though the position had improved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the sizeable losses posted in 2008. The pick-up in profitability had reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral factors, including the one-off nature of earlier securities write-downs,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased income from investment banking activities and higher net interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome, which reflected steep yield curves in many countries. The main factor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto watch in the period ahead would be bad-debt charges, which were likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain high for some time and could rise further.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBanks in Australia, Canada and Asia (excluding Japan) were doing considerably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter than those in the United States and Europe.

For the major banks in Australia, growth in net interest income had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased, and provisions for loan losses appeared to have peaked at levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat were low by international standards. Non-performing loans were disproportionately\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin commercial property lending, while impairment rates for housing loans remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian banks and other authorised deposit-taking institutions remained well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapitalised, reflecting ongoing profitability and recent equity raisings, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased their holdings of liquid assets. The global focus on strengthening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe deposit bases of banks and higher liquidity standards had seen increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition for deposits, resulting in sharp rises in interest rates on term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeposit specials.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn discussing the exposures of the global banking sector to Greece, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that these were quite small both in absolute terms and, for countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the largest banking sector claims on Greece, as a proportion of their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttotal foreign claims.

Staff estimates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that the national accounts, to be released the next day, would show\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic growth of ¾–1 per  cent in the December quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary data suggested that the labour market had continued to firm, consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending had held up reasonably well overall and a pick-up in dwelling activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas under way. Indications were that the mining sector would, on balance, provide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta significant boost to the Australian economy over a number of years. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the staff forecasts showed that economic activity would grow at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround trend rates over the next couple of years. Indeed, some recent indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that growth might already have been running at or close to trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the moderation in private-sector wage growth in the most recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata supported the forecast that underlying inflation would fall further in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe near term, to around 2½ per cent on a year-ended basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the coming year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers took note of the positive developments in the financial sector, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearly signs that credit to business was becoming easier after the difficult\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod last year.

However, there was some variation across sectors,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand some caution in spending plans outside the mining sector. The non-residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding sector remained subdued and, abstracting from the surge in construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof educational facilities, new approvals were at relatively low levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpot prices for coal, iron ore and other resources had continued to rise over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past month.

Initial indications for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontract prices for coal also pointed to large increases. The strength in coal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand iron ore prices over recent years was partly a reflection of the very large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in global steel production over the past decade, which in turn reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe high steel intensity associated with growth of the Chinese economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDevelopments in commodity markets meant that the increase in the terms of trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough 2010 was likely to be substantially larger than forecast in the February\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<cite>Statement\r\n                                      on Monetary Policy</cite>.

Members discussed the factors contributing to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent strong price growth. On the demand side, population growth was strong,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds had confidence about future income growth, and mortgage rates were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat below-average levels. At the same time, the supply of new housing was not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpanding sufficiently, partly because of the land usage policies of local\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand state governments and also because of the tightness of finance for developers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers also noted that the current price growth was somewhat at odds with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe falls in housing loan approvals over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit to the household sector had recently continued to grow at a moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpace of around 0.7 per cent per month.

There had also been some further issuance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) over the past month. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree of the issues had some support from the Australian Office of Financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tManagement program, there had been strong private-sector demand.

In addition to the developments in Europe, two factors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad adversely affected investor sentiment: the large intra-day fall on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS share market on 6 May, whose cause in part appeared to relate to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivities of model-based high-frequency trading platforms; and the unexpected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannouncement by the German financial regulator of a ban on ‘naked’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshort-selling of a range of financial instruments.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForeign exchange markets had also seen the effect of investors' reduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twillingness to take on risk. Volatility in exchange rates had increased significantly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe euro had depreciated further against the US dollar in May, but from a longer-run\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperspective was not at a particularly low level in trade-weighted terms. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar had appreciated against most currencies during May, with the exception\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the yen. The renminbi had remained fixed to the US dollar at the rate set\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talmost two years earlier; the broad appreciation of the US dollar over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month implied that the renminbi had appreciated in nominal trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been several large moves in the Australian dollar exchange rate over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past month. Partly, this reflected the fact that many traders had taken\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t‘long’ positions in the Australian dollar against other currencies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin terms of their benchmark exposures, and the exchange rate fell as a consequence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof these positions being unwound. Members were informed that the depreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the exchange rate generally had been orderly, with a satisfactory level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof liquidity in the market. The exchange rate had depreciated by about 7 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent on a trade-weighted basis over the past month; volatility had been high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut was below the peak level in October 2008. Taking a longer perspective,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Australian dollar remained well above its post-float average, both against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US dollar and in trade-weighted terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to monetary policy settings, members observed that the expected commencement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof policy tightening in the major economies had now been pushed out into next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, with the exception of Canada. In Australia, market pricing at the time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the meeting indicated that no change in the cash rate was expected. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the increase in the cash rate at the previous meeting had been passed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough to lending interest rates in full, and that lending rates to both households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand businesses were now around their average levels of the past decade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in the international economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby observing that the recent turmoil in financial markets had prompted a number\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof European governments to announce a significant tightening of fiscal policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA few months earlier, it had appeared that those economies with poor fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpositions might be able to wait until economic recovery was more firmly entrenched\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore undertaking significant fiscal consolidation. However, the escalation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof market uncertainties meant that the downside risks from waiting to announce\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttighter fiscal policy had increased. The fiscal measures announced had included\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpay freezes or pay cuts for public-sector employees, increases in the retirement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tage and increases in value-added tax rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the fiscal challenges facing Europe. Sizeable budget deficits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere expected to persist for a number of years in some countries. This was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin part a reflection of the large structural deficits that had built up over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe years, with breaches of the deficit limit of the European Union's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStability and Growth Pact having not been unusual, even when economic conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been relatively benign. Debt to GDP ratios were projected to continue to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease significantly in many countries, raising concerns about fiscal sustainability.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the fiscal challenges faced by many governments, not only\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Europe, would be accentuated by the changes in demographic patterns that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere occurring in most countries, notably ageing populations and rising dependency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratios.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in much of Europe had been soft, though economic conditions were somewhat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrighter in Germany, with industrial production growing again and construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending picking up. Members noted that growth in much of the rest of the world\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been quite strong, especially in Asia. In China, retail sales, investment,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports and credit had all risen further in April, with investment particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong in the first four months of the year. In the housing market, growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin house prices had remained strong up to April, but there were indications\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a slowing in turnover in May, suggesting that the policy measures taken\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier were having some effect on conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElsewhere in Asia, growth had continued to surprise on the upside, with domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand in the region growing solidly over the past year. A number of east Asian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies had registered double-digit GDP growth rates over the year to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch quarter, and data for exports and industrial production in April suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat growth was continuing in the current quarter. India had recorded strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth in the March quarter and there had been an upward revision to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier and surprisingly weak figure for the December quarter. With Asia accounting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor more than half of Japan's total exports, strength in domestic demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the region was benefiting the Japanese economy, which had registered strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic conditions had also continued to improve in the United States. Employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now growing again, after contracting through 2008 and 2009, and labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket participation had picked up. While higher participation would slow the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprospective fall in the unemployment rate, growth in employment would help\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto support consumption growth. Business investment was rising and capital goods\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders had increased strongly over the past year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, in contrast to the turbulence in financial markets, the recent data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton global economic activity had generally been positive and suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe global economy was expanding at a relatively firm pace over the first part\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2010. It was too early to tell what effect the current turbulence in financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets would have on the global recovery. It was likely that weaker activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Europe would have some flow-on effects to the rest of the world through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe traditional trade channels, though the more important consideration would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe the extent to which the problems in Europe had a sustained effect on global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattitudes to risk. Offsetting these effects, members observed that the uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounding developments in Europe might mean that the process of withdrawing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy stimulus in other parts of the world, including in Asia, would be delayed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe developments in financial markets and in Europe and concerns about a potential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing in construction activity in China had resulted in falls in commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices over the past month. There had been significant declines in the prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor oil, iron ore and base metals. Nevertheless, spot prices for Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbulk commodities were still above those in the June quarter 2010 export contracts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, members observed that conditions had been mixed. There had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta high level of activity in the construction sector from the fiscal stimulus,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut retail spending had been relatively subdued and there were some signs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing in the housing market. The national accounts for the March quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere due for release the day after the meeting. The staff expected the data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto show modest growth in GDP for the quarter, with conditions varying across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors of the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the household sector, surveys showed that sentiment had declined in May,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough it remained above its long-run average level. Developments in household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending had been mixed. ABS data on retail trade, including figures that were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treleased during the meeting, showed solid growth in spending in March and April,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut spending was only modestly higher than a year earlier, when it had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboosted by government transfer payments. Liaison with retailers suggested fairly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak trading conditions more recently, with many retailers noting that significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscounting was occurring. In contrast, purchases of motor vehicles by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold sector had been strong this year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted some signs that the earlier buoyancy in the housing market was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing. Most notably, auction clearance rates in May had been lower than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery high levels of earlier months. Growth in housing credit had slowed in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApril, after a decline in loan approvals over the prior six months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment was estimated to have fallen in the March quarter, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis largely reflecting the earlier pull-forward of spending on plant and equipment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a result of tax incentives. The ABS capital expenditure survey continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto point to strong growth in spending on buildings and structures in 2010/11,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially in the mining sector, implying continued strong growth in the capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstock over the next year or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost business surveys continued to point to above-average levels of business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence and conditions. Construction activity was being supported by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong growth in public spending, especially for building in the education\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. Construction in the office and commercial sectors remained weak, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were signs of some pick-up in the apartment sector. Liaison suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat financing conditions for firms in the construction sector were improving,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough they remained tight. More broadly, business loan approvals also appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be rising, though business credit had declined in April after having been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly unchanged over the preceding three months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian Government estimated that its budget deficit would narrow significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2010/11 and return to a small surplus in 2012/13, three years earlier than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojected a year ago. Policy changes announced in the Budget were, in net terms,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly neutral for the cumulative budget position over the next four years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe projected narrowing of the deficit primarily reflected the effects of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timproving economy (including the higher level of the terms of trade) and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscheduled winding down of stimulus measures announced in late 2008 and early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2009.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe labour market had continued to perform solidly, with a further increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin employment in April.

Measures of inflation expectations were generally at, or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little above, the average of the past decade or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the setting of monetary policy, members noted that the situation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Europe had deteriorated significantly over the previous month. Market confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been severely eroded, and some governments were now in the very difficult\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition of having to tighten fiscal policy at a time when growth remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak. Notwithstanding the actions that had been taken by European policymakers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the IMF, the situation remained uncertain. The difficulties in Europe would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinevitably weigh somewhat on prospects for global growth. However, in areas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as Asia where growth had recently been strong, it had become more likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the withdrawal of policy stimulus would be delayed as a result of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in Europe.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the international environment facing the Australian economy had become\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore uncertain, members noted that the medium-term outlook remained positive.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prices of Australia's main commodity exports were still elevated,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespite recent falls, and the high level of the terms of trade would add to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic incomes and demand. Most indicators suggested that the economy was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinuing to expand and employment growth had been solid. Conditions, however,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclearly differed across sectors and aggregate spending was still being supported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby public demand. While recent data for prices and wages suggested that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisinflationary forces in the economy were not quite as strong as previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected, global events could also have implications for the inflation outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the medium term. Members noted that the CPI data for the June quarter, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be released in late July, would provide information on the extent of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflationary pressures in the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a result of actions at previous meetings, policy had moved from the very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpansionary settings reached in early 2009 to the point where interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaid by borrowers were now around their average levels of the past decade or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso.

Concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the fiscal position of some European countries had persisted since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune meeting. Moody's had downgraded Greece's debt in mid June,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that Greece was no longer rated investment grade by any of the three major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trating agencies. Moody's had also placed Spain's AAA rating on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treview for possible downgrade.

Members observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, in order to settle markets, it was critical that the stress tests be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregarded as credible and that plans be in place to deal with any capital shortfall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tidentified by the stress tests.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor the major economies sovereign-level yields had fallen, with US 10-year yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalling below 3 per cent and German yields declining back to historic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlows. Australian Government yields had also fallen over the month to 5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough there was little market trading, indicative pricing suggested a widening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin spreads for Greece and a number of other euro area economies.

While there had recently been a modest increase in some funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts, some lending rates (particularly for businesses) had risen in line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket rates, such that there had been little change in net interest margins.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity markets had recovered somewhat in the first part of June, but turned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown sharply again later in the month.

The PBC had stated that it viewed the exchange rate as close to fair\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue, and so far the daily changes had been small and in both directions,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a net appreciation of around 1 per cent. Over the past year, however, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenminbi had appreciated considerably in trade-weighted terms, reflecting its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise against the weakening euro. The Australian dollar had traded in a wide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trange but the trade-weighted index was little changed over the month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe discussion then turned to international economic developments. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the global economy had continued to grow in the June quarter, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty about the future strength of the recovery had risen and downside\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks were apparent, largely reflecting ongoing concerns about the fiscal situation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Europe and the health of the European banking system. In contrast, economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Asia remained robust, although there were signs that growth in the region\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas moderating to a more sustainable pace after the strong V-shaped recovery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the previous year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Europe, many governments had recently announced discretionary tightening of fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy. Spain, Italy and Portugal announced fiscal tightening amounting to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat least 2 per cent of GDP over the coming year, while Greece had announced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightening measures equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP. Some of the larger economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also announced some tightening of fiscal policy, although the cuts were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmaller and would be implemented more gradually.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe timely survey data on euro area confidence and current business conditions had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshown surprising resilience for the period since early May, despite the financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket turbulence. More generally, the economic data for a number of countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost notably Germany, was more positive than had been the case a few months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier, and it was likely that euro area GDP would record a solid rise in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe June quarter after little growth over the previous half year. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the German labour market had held up very well over the past two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, retail sales, fixed asset investment, exports and credit had all grown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly in May. On the other hand, growth in industrial production had moderated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past few months. Members observed that some slowing in industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction had been inevitable from the growth of over 20 per cent seen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier this year. Conditions in the property market had also cooled, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the major cities. Growth in higher-end residential construction was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto slow over coming quarters, with the authorities encouraging growth in construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof housing for lower-income residents.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWage growth in China had recently picked up noticeably. This was not surprising given\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strong economic expansion over the past year and the freezes in provincial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tminimum wages in 2009. From a structural perspective, this growth could be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregarded as a positive development if it were part of the shift in national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome towards the household sector that is required over the longer run. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe short run, it could add to rising inflation pressures, although members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the authorities' new approach to the exchange rate had the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpotential to assist in macroeconomic management over the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElsewhere in Asia, there were also early signs that growth was returning to a more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustainable pace after the very strong bounce-back from the contraction in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlate 2008 and early 2009. Export volumes had continued to grow solidly and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour demand had been strong, although industrial production had been broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunchanged in some economies over April and May.

However, labour market conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained soft and the payrolls data (excluding census jobs) for May and June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been disappointing. Unlike in Europe, no new steps had yet been taken to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttighten fiscal policy, although there would be some unwinding of temporary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures through this year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe large output gaps in the United States and the euro area had been reflected in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan ongoing decline in inflation, with core inflation running at annualised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates of ½–¾ per cent over the past half-year. Inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas significantly higher in the United Kingdom, partly reflecting the increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the VAT rate and the depreciation of the pound sterling. Inflation in China\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad picked up after the deflation seen in early 2009, although it appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have stabilised at an annualised rate of around 3 per cent over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent flow of data suggested that the domestic economy continued to expand at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta solid pace, with public-sector spending providing support to activity. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnational accounts for the March quarter had been released the day after the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune meeting and showed an increase in GDP of 0.5 per cent in the quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 2.7 per cent over the year. Looking forward, the staff expected growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin private demand to pick up as investment strengthened, supported by high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumer sentiment remained modestly above its long-run average, although it had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen recently. However, sales of motor vehicles to households had been strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent months and retail spending had recorded increases in March, April\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand May after showing little growth over the previous nine months. Liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith retailers in late June suggested a slightly more positive picture than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta few months ago, although many retailers reported that conditions remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued and that significant discounting had been required to drive sales.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness surveys had also indicated some easing in confidence over recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough trading conditions remained a little above average levels. Recently,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome measures of firms' investment intentions had increased quite strongly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand capital goods imports increased in May, which would be consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe staff forecast of a gradual pick-up in private-sector investment. In addition,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe amount of work yet to be done in mining was very high, particularly for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe LNG sector. Business credit had recorded a modest increase in May after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclining for most of the preceding year and a half. Notwithstanding this,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate non-residential approvals remained weak; if this persisted it suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta tightening in some commercial property markets could emerge in the medium\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe slowing in growth in Chinese steel production had been reflected in falls in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiron ore and steel prices. Spot prices for iron ore were now below the estimated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontract price for the September quarter. Spot prices for coking coal had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teased.

Price data to May were mixed but provided\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome tentative evidence of a deceleration in growth relative to earlier in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year.

Continuing the pattern\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof recent months, the increase was entirely driven by full-time jobs. Business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurveys and data on job advertisements had been generally firm, suggesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther solid gains in employment in coming months. The unemployment rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen to 5.2 per cent in May, which members noted was a significantly better\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutcome than had been expected a year earlier.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe federal minimum wage decision was for an increase of 4.8 per cent from 1 July,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the wage freeze last year.

While the measures being taken there should help the prospects for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustainable growth over the longer term, prospects for European growth going\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto 2011 were weaker. The US economy had shown moderate growth in the first\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf of 2010, but members noted that recent labour market outcomes had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisappointing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers saw some moderation in Asian growth as desirable, given concerns about possible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverheating in those economies, but there was likely to be some uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the near term about the extent of the slowing. For Australia, a critical\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-term question was the extent to which economies in Asia could continue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto grow strongly in the face of what could be an extended period of subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the major North Atlantic economies. Overall, members considered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the most likely outcome was for growth in Australia's major trading\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartners to be around trend over the next couple of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe domestic economy had been growing at a solid rate over the past year, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta sizeable contribution from fiscal spending.

This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to offset the scaling back in public demand that would be taking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace.

There would also be an updated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treading on domestic prices.

Recently, economic activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have strengthened in Europe after a half year of little growth,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut there had been moderation in some other parts of the world.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, in Asia, this moderation was occurring from a very rapid pace,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was likely to put these economies on a more sustainable path. In China,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testimates of GDP had shown an increase of around 2½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter, which was another strong result but a little below the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarterly outcomes recorded over much of 2009. The monthly indicators suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat investment had slowed in June, while growth in retail spending had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirm. Members discussed developments in the Chinese property market, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe earlier policy measures were contributing to a cooling, with turnover lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand housing prices declining in a number of markets. There had also been a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing in the construction sector and the production of inputs, such as cement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand steel, after very strong growth in 2009. Overall, while the extent of slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the Chinese economy remained uncertain, the recent indicators did not suggest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta more marked slowing than the staff had been expecting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in other parts of Asia remained solid but, as expected, it appeared to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderating from the rapid pace seen over the previous year.

The Indian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy had been expanding rapidly and was expected to remain strong, but inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures remained elevated. In Japan, the expansion appeared to be continuing,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough growth in exports and production had slowed over the past couple of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths. In the household sector, measures of consumer sentiment had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rise to above-average levels, though the unemployment rate had recently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tedged up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Europe, the recent economic data had been better than expected, and measures of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness and consumer sentiment in the larger countries did not appear to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen much affected by the recent concerns over fiscal policy. GDP growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe June quarter was surprisingly strong in the United Kingdom, and a solid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in euro area GDP was expected after little growth over the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf year.

While this suggested that labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had tightened over the past year, other indicators, such as business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurveys, suggested that businesses in most sectors were not encountering significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty in finding suitable labour. In addition, average hours worked had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up only modestly after falling significantly during late 2008 and early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2009. Members noted that a significant decline in the unemployment rate typically\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that the economy had been growing at a rate above potential, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis stood in contrast to the GDP data, which suggested that growth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow potential.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile growth had been boosted by fiscal stimulus over the past year and a half, this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be reversed in the period ahead as public investment declined following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe completion of stimulus-related projects. At the same time, a strengthening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin business investment was in prospect. Capital goods imports had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent months and most survey-based measures of firms' investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions had increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness conditions, as measured by surveys, remained at or above average levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOne area of weakness continued to be commercial construction, where financing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions remained tight, though both liaison and approvals data provided\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome early indications of a strengthening in office construction. This was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with office vacancy rates having peaked in Sydney and Melbourne.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness credit was unchanged in June, though commercial loan approvals had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen trending modestly higher over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeasures of consumer sentiment had risen in July to be at quite high levels again.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank's liaison with retailers suggested that households generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained cautious in their spending, though a number of firms had reported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat conditions had improved a little from earlier in the year. The retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade data showed a further modest increase in spending in the month of June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a 0.8 per cent increase in the volume of spending in the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese data also provided evidence of significant discounting, with retail prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly 0.1 per cent higher in the quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed broader trends in household behaviour. They noted that the household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaving rate was at a higher level than a few years earlier, and credit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas much lower than over the past decade. Household surveys suggested some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange in attitudes to saving and a greater degree of caution about household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinances. Looking ahead, members observed that the challenges of dealing with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta terms of trade boom and strong growth in investment would be lessened if\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese trends in household behaviour continued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been further signs of a cooling in the established housing market after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta year of strong price increases. Housing prices had shown little growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past few months, with prices falling in June, including in Melbourne where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice growth had earlier been strongest. Auction clearance rates in Sydney\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Melbourne had declined significantly, to around average levels. Housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloan approvals were estimated to have declined further in June and housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth had moderated. These developments suggested that the earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in lending rates were having an effect on household behaviour.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CPI data for the June quarter had showed a further decline in underlying inflation,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the Bank's earlier forecasts. In underlying terms, inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas around 0.5 per cent in the quarter and 2¾ per cent over the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was the first time that underlying inflation had been below 3 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent in nearly three years, though headline CPI inflation was a little higher,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat 3.1 per cent, with a significant contribution from the effects of the increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttobacco excise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the moderation in inflation reflected a combination of factors,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding the relatively subdued demand conditions over much of 2008 and 2009,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slowing in private-sector wage growth in 2009 and the appreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate. Discounting at retail stores had continued to depress the prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof many goods. There had also been a large decline in the price of domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholiday travel and accommodation, partly reflecting subdued demand in parts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof that industry. Food price inflation had been relatively low, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoftness in the prices of some global food commodities, the appreciation of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe exchange rate and discounting. Unlike in previous quarters, there was little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange in utilities prices, though substantial rises were expected over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnext year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the updated staff forecasts, which were little changed from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts prepared at the time of the May meeting. The central forecast was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor GDP growth to increase gradually to the 3¾–4 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trange in 2011 and 2012. The outlook was underpinned by the positive prospects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the resources sector, which in turn rested on the bright medium-term outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the economies in Asia. Reflecting developments in commodity markets over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past three months, the forecast for the terms of trade had been revised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown slightly since May, but the terms of trade would still be at an historically\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level and were expected to continue supporting domestic incomes and business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe central forecast for inflation was essentially unchanged. Underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to be around 2¾ per cent over the next year or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso, though year-ended headline inflation was likely to be above 3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next year, largely reflecting the rise in tobacco excise and large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in the prices of utilities. Underlying inflation was then expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto increase gradually to around 3 per cent in 2012. This reflected the expectation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat strong economic growth associated with the expansion of the resources\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector would again put pressure on the economy's supply capacity. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that there remained both upside and downside risks around these central\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main influence on financial markets over the past month had been the publication\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the results of the stress test of the European banking system, conducted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton 91 institutions representing two-thirds of banking system assets. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the nature and results of the stress test. They noted that financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had generally responded favourably to the results, in part because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the information provided about banks' exposures, including their sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt holdings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSovereign yields in the major economies rose somewhat after the stress test results\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere published and the release of stronger euro area economic data, but they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained at low levels. Yields on government debt in Australia over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth had moved in a similar fashion to those in the major economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpreads on the sovereign debt of the smaller European countries had fallen over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month, and debt issuance by a number of these countries over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth had been oversubscribed. Spreads on emerging market debt in Asia and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLatin America had also declined over the past month. Spreads on corporate debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States and euro area had also fallen, with issuance by European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial institutions increasing following the publication of the stress test\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresults, as well as favourable banks' earnings reports. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, in the United States, issuance of mortgage-backed securities continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be dominated by the mortgage agencies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to monetary policy settings around the world, members noted that policy rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not changed in the major economies, where expectations of any change had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen pushed out until well into 2011 at the earliest. This had resulted in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo-year bond yields in the major countries declining further, including to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta 70-year low in the United States. Monetary policy operations by the European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCentral Bank (ECB) had provided less liquidity over the past month and debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurchases had slowed considerably, which led to a decline in the ECB's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbalance sheet. Euro area interbank lending rates had risen back towards the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 per cent policy rate, following a period in which these rates had been around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t½ percentage point below it. Central banks in several other countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad begun to raise policy rates. The Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tZealand increased their policy rates by 25 basis points for the second consecutive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth. In emerging market economies, the central banks of Brazil, Chile, India,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIsrael and Malaysia raised rates over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity market price indices rose in July, supported by the stress test results,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger data from Europe and better-than-expected corporate earnings.

Following its initial appreciation after the change\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the exchange rate regime in June, the renminbi had been little changed against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US dollar, which implied that it had depreciated on a trade-weighted basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of the US dollar's broad-based depreciation. The Australian dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad appreciated by around 5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, with a larger rise against the US dollar, reflecting relatively strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic economic data early in the month and a general increase in risk appetite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong market participants.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed developments in Australian banks' funding.

Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe composition of banks' funding had changed over the past few years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the share of deposits and long-term debt having increased and funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom short-term debt and securitisation having declined. There had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange in the cost of deposits in recent months as competition in that sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad stabilised. Short-term wholesale costs had fallen back towards recent average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels but longer-term spreads had increased somewhat, as had cross-currency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis swap spreads.

Importantly for Australia, Asia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expanding strongly.

Members expected that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboost to investment in the resources sector would stimulate activity elsewhere\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the economy, even though there was a significant imported component in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplanned LNG projects. Business surveys reported that conditions remained at,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor above, average levels, though confidence had softened a little. The main\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarea of weakness continued to be commercial construction, where funding constraints\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained an issue.

While retailers continued to report that conditions were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenging, retail spending had picked up in recent months and the national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounts measure of consumption was surprisingly strong in the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis strength was, however, partly a reflection of a boost to spending on motor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvehicles following damage from hailstorms in Victoria and Western Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsumer confidence was at high levels and labour income growth had been solid.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast, the household sector's reduced appetite for debt was continuing,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith housing credit growth easing over recent months and repayments of credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcard debt picking up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions had cooled in the established housing market, partly reflecting the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn of mortgage rates to more normal levels. At the national level, prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been broadly unchanged since April, with the top end of the market tending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be softer than the rest of the market. Auction clearance rates in Sydney\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Melbourne had been around average levels recently, after having been considerably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove average earlier in the year.

Business surveys and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata on job advertisements suggested further solid gains in employment over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming months. The unemployment rate had risen a little to 5.3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin July and had been broadly unchanged since the start of the year, which was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the economy growing at around trend pace.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main news on prices and wages had been the release of the June quarter wage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice index, which showed that wage growth in the private sector had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively modest, though it had picked up a little over the first half of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2010. In contrast, growth in public-sector wages had continued at a firm pace.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness surveys and liaison suggested that a gradual pick-up in wage growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected over the next year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeveral measures of inflation expectations had eased a little over recent months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be around average levels.

This was particularly so at the shorter end\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the yield curve, reflecting the expectation that policy rates in the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies would remain low for an extended period.

During the month, the Federal Reserve announced that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepayments of principal on its agency securities would be reinvested into US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTreasuries, so that its balance sheet would not contract.

In Greece, the first quarterly review of the support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogram from the European Commission, ECB and IMF had been completed, indicating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the program was on track.

Notwithstanding the issues stemming from the fiscal problems of some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEuropean economies, the health of the large international banks had mostly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timproved. Investor sentiment had been bolstered by the euro area support package\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the results of the banking system stress test. Conditions in the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial system remained significantly stronger than in most other countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that exposures of Australian banks to the fiscally stretched\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro area economies were very small.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEven though bank share price indices in the major developed countries had generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen somewhat over the past six months, reported profitability and capitalisation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof banking systems had improved. Many large banks in the United States, euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarea, United Kingdom and Japan had recorded profits over recent reporting periods,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough profits were generally still well below pre-crisis levels. In a number\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof cases, the flow of provisions for bad loans appeared to have peaked.

The rate of non-performing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets appeared to have stabilised, and was at a level far below the peak following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe early 1990s recession, with significant write-backs of earlier provisioning\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow occurring as asset quality improved. The earlier pick-up in non-performing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets had been mostly in business lending, and non-performing loans to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold sector were relatively low. Members noted that non-performance rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor housing loans were far below those seen in the United States and some European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe banking sector's capital position had been bolstered by actions in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears to increase the level of capital through a combination of new equity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuance and dividend reinvestment plans. Banks had also moved to strengthen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir liquidity positions by lengthening the term structure of their wholesale\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliabilities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe aggregate financial position of the household and business sectors remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsound, with the stronger economy boosting wage incomes and profits. Indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof financial stress in the household sector remained low compared with previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdownturns and international experience. Households appeared to be taking a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore cautious approach to their finances, with the household debt-to-income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratio broadly stable over the past few years, after a decade when it grew rapidly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBanks had also taken a relatively cautious approach to lending in the post-crisis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironment, with a significant fall over the past year in the proportion of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew housing loans with loan-to-value ratios over 90 per cent.

The various indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovided slightly different pictures of the extent of labour market tightness.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the unemployment rate was around the level it had been in late 2004 and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearly 2005, the ABS measure of the number of vacancies suggested a somewhat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttighter labour market, whereas business surveys suggested that most firms were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot experiencing significant difficulties finding labour.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLiaison with retailers suggested that household spending had strengthened a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent months, and the ABS data that were released during the meeting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed moderate growth in retail spending in August. While consumer confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained at a high level, most retailers continued to report that consumers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained cautious, somewhat at odds with the latest national accounts, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad suggested that overall spending grew strongly in the June quarter. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcautiousness of the household sector was perhaps most evident on the financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside, with growth in mortgage debt slowing over recent months and credit card\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt broadly flat thus far in 2010.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis slowdown in the pace of borrowing by households had been accompanied by a cooling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the established housing market, with measures of nationwide housing prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown slightly over recent months and auction clearance rates closer to average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan in the early part of the year. Members observed that cooling in the market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the slowing in borrowing was a welcome development given the significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger-term run-up in prices and household debt. They observed that there were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome signs that the rental market was tightening again, with vacancy rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some states declining from levels that were already quite low. The tightness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the rental market was likely to persist given the ongoing strong population\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and the decline in housing approvals this year, and could be expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto feed into increases in rents. Approvals for construction of apartments remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat low levels in most states, with Victoria a clear exception.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment was expected to strengthen over the next few years and to offset\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe scaling back in public investment. Most business surveys continued to report\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat current conditions, capacity utilisation and confidence were at, or above,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage levels. In addition, the Bank's liaison program provided some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearly signs that investment was starting to pick up, although recent indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill showed a mixed picture. The pipeline of engineering work to be done was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a very high level, although non-residential building approvals remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlow. It was also noteworthy that business credit had fallen in July and August\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter a period when it had been broadly flat. Members discussed the factors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbehind the subdued level of lending to businesses, which was most apparent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin lending to larger businesses, with lending to small businesses expanding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat an annualised rate of 6 per cent in the first eight months of 2010. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved that the low level of new bank lending at present partly reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ample availability of internally generated funds, given that the profit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of GDP was at a high level in both the mining and non-mining sectors,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand good access to equity funding and non-bank financing from the capital markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the farm sector had improved significantly. Rainfall for the year to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdate had been good over most of the country, though the cropping areas of Western\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia had experienced below-average rainfall. Forecasts for the 2010 wheat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrop had been raised recently, and the farm sector was expected to contribute\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly to GDP growth in 2010/11.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been little new information on price and wage inflation over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeasures of inflation expectations were relatively close to average levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe September quarter CPI would be released on 27 October. A year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease of around 3 per cent, with underlying inflation around 2½–2¾\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent, would be consistent with the central forecast scenario.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIreland had been the focal point of concerns in financial markets over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that periods of acute stress in the euro area were likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecur for some time to come.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Government was in the process of dismantling Anglo Irish Bank, which had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously received sizable capital injections from the Government.

However, yields fell again later in the month following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindications of further monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve and renewed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns over the smaller European countries. Longer-term government bond yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia had not fallen as much as elsewhere given the relatively better\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmacroeconomic environment, which had led to a widening of the spread to US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTreasuries to around a two-decade high. Nevertheless, members noted that domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields remained at low levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn monetary policy, members noted that a number of central banks, including those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Canada, India and Sweden, had continued on their tightening path. In contrast,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Federal Reserve indicated that it was seriously considering further quantitative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing and had started to reinvest the proceeds of maturing mortgage-backed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurities into Treasuries. The Bank of Japan was meeting on the same day,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand market expectations were for further easing there also.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prospect of further monetary stimulus had seen the US dollar depreciate against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost currencies over the past month. As a result, the yen rose to a 15-year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh in nominal terms, prompting the Japanese authorities to intervene in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket for the first time since 2004. The initial result of the intervention\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a 3 per cent depreciation of the yen, but subsequently the yen reversed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost of this depreciation. Members noted that the period of deflation over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral years in Japan implied that the real effective exchange rate of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyen was in the middle of the range of the past few decades.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US Congress had increased its pressure on the Chinese authorities to appreciate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe renminbi, proposing retaliatory legislation against Chinese imports. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenminbi had been allowed to appreciate again, following a period of relative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstability since the initial change to the exchange rate regime in June. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton a trade-weighted basis, the renminbi had depreciated further, given the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciation of the US dollar against many currencies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had appreciated by almost 4 per cent over the past month, to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe near multi-decade highs against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the appreciation of the exchange rate represented a tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof domestic financial conditions. They were briefed on changes to the weights\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the trade-weighted index, with these updated annually to reflect changes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia's merchandise trade patterns. The main change in the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear had been another large increase in the weight of the renminbi in the index.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNotwithstanding the market concerns over conditions in Ireland, equity markets rose\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolidly over the past month, reversing the decline of the previous month.

Despite further issuance of residential mortgage-backed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurities in September, the market remained dependent on the support of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian Office of Financial Management, which had purchased the longer-dated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttranches in the month and a third of total issuance in the September quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted staff estimates that banks' funding costs had been relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflat over recent months.

Global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic growth remained around trend, but with significant differences across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregions. In the North Atlantic economies, growth remained subdued, and there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere clearly downside risks, not least because there was little room for policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto respond if conditions deteriorated. In Asia, however, prospects remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor solid growth, despite some slowing from earlier in the year. Recent data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor China had been a little stronger than in earlier months, suggesting that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe risk of an unexpectedly large slowdown had diminished. Latin America was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso generally doing well. Against this background, the prices of many of Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texport commodities remained at high levels. Equity markets had also strengthened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month, even though financial markets were still characterised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby a degree of uncertainty, most notably emanating from the strains on public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinances and banking systems in some of the smaller European economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, members noted that the economy appeared to be evolving broadly in line\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the Bank's expectations. The outlook remained for public spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto slow but for private demand to pick up noticeably, particularly in the case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof business investment. For the moment, however, indicators of current growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin demand remained moderate, both for households and businesses, and credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been subdued, especially for businesses. Year-ended inflation had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderated from earlier excessive levels, and in underlying terms was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto remain within the target range over the near term; the recent further rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the exchange rate would help promote this outcome.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs in the previous month, members concluded that interest rates would need to rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat some point if the economy evolved in line with the central scenario of a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradual tightening in resource utilisation, as this would most likely result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a gradual strengthening of inflation pressures. The timing of adjustment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained a matter of judgement. A case could be made to increase the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the current meeting, based on the medium-term inflation outlook and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfact that developments had continued to be broadly consistent with the central\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast scenario. The case to wait before making a tightening move was that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy was still expected to continue growing at trend in the near term,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth had softened somewhat and the rise in the exchange rate would,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif it continued, effectively be tightening financial conditions at the margin.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, it was still possible that downside risks to global growth could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaterialise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers felt that these arguments were finely balanced.

While Chinese exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand imports had declined slightly over recent months, both consumption and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment looked to have grown solidly. There were also further signs that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe property market was strengthening again after having cooled earlier in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponse to policy measures. Inflation had increased recently, largely reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher food prices. In response to these developments, the People's Bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof China had lifted benchmark interest rates for the first time in the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphase and additional measures had been taken to dampen activity in the property\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in other parts of Asia had also eased from its earlier strong pace, but remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolid.

Developments in the LNG sector, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe likely significant imported component, appeared to be broadly in line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier assumptions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe impact of the exchange rate appreciation was evident in a number of sectors.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVisitor arrivals had increased only modestly over the past five years, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverseas departures by Australians had increased strongly, with a consequent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in domestic tourism. The high exchange rate had also had a negative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on the education sector, although changes in government policies were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to have been a more important factor. Despite the strengthening of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate, surveys suggested that conditions in the manufacturing sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere around average. In part, this reflected the fact that many manufacturers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefited from cheaper imported capital equipment and components when the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate appreciated, and that some focused mostly on the domestic market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions were mixed in other sectors, and there were few signs of recovery in non-residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction, where access to funding remained tight. Members discussed recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in business finance. While credit outstanding had declined in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months, it appeared that many large businesses had good access to funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom profits and the capital markets, and business surveys suggested that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavailability of finance had improved relative to late 2008 and early 2009.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was noteworthy that business deposits had been rising over the past year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile lending was falling.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe staff's revised central forecast for GDP growth was broadly similar to that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the time of the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. GDP was expected to expand by 3½\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent over 2010, with growth picking up to be in the 3¾–4 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent range over 2011 and 2012. This positive outlook for the domestic economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas underpinned by the income surge flowing from the very high level of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of trade and the expected growth in investment in the resources sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the terms of trade were expected to decline over the next couple of years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texport prices were forecast to remain at a higher level than at the time of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe August <em>Statement</em>.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CPI had increased by 0.7 per cent in the September quarter, to be 2.8 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher over the year. This was a slightly smaller rise than had been expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree months earlier, partly reflecting a surprising fall in food prices and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower fuel prices. Utilities prices increased significantly in the quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand rose by 12 per cent over the year, reflecting broad-based increases in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telectricity, gas and water &amp; sewerage charges. Members discussed the significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in electricity prices in recent years, which in part reflected ongoing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong demand, especially at peak times, and an earlier period of under-investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the distribution network.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn underlying terms, inflation was around ½ per cent in the quarter and 2½ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the year. Members viewed the return of year-ended underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the middle of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> target as a positive development.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the staff assessment was that underlying inflation was unlikely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderate much further, given the pick-up in economic growth over the past year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the strengthening of the labour market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe medium-term outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged, although the near-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast for year-ended inflation had been lowered slightly. In underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms, inflation was expected to remain around 2½ per cent until mid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2011, before gradually rising to 3 per cent by the end of 2012. Year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theadline CPI inflation was expected to remain above underlying inflation in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe near term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main driver of financial market developments over the past month had been the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectation that the Federal Reserve would engage in further quantitative easing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn announcement was expected following the FOMC policy meeting later in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweek. The exact nature of the Fed's action was still uncertain but it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to involve significant further purchases of US Treasuries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment debt yields had remained low in most of the major economies, indicating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat policy interest rates in those economies were expected to remain at their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent levels for the foreseeable future. The Bank of Japan had announced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional easing, including a slight lowering in its target for the policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate, a commitment to maintain this policy until price stability was in sight,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand further asset purchases.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe balance sheet of the European Central Bank (ECB) had been contracting for several\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths as earlier liquidity operations matured. This was resulting in an upward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrift in short-term market rates towards the ECB's policy rate. Data to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe end of September showed a rise in borrowing from the ECB by Irish banks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut modest falls in borrowing by some of the other smaller countries.

In China, the central bank had lifted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeposit and lending rates for the first time since 2007. There had also been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightening of monetary policy in Chile, Singapore, Sweden and Taiwan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe expectation of further easing by the Federal Reserve had provided a boost to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal equity markets, which had risen back to their levels prior to the Greek\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturmoil earlier in the year. Emerging market equities had performed relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter over this period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOne sector that had underperformed the global market was the US banking sector, whose\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare prices had been weighed down by recent earnings reports that showed a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing in income growth, and by the concerns about the foreclosure process\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had recently surfaced. Members noted that around 5 per cent of all US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmortgages were in the process of foreclosure at the end of June.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExpectations of US monetary easing had affected currency markets, causing the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar to weaken. In trade-weighted terms, the US dollar was now only slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove its record low in 2008. The Japanese yen was close to its record high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(in nominal terms) against the US dollar. The Chinese renminbi had been broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunchanged against the US dollar over the previous month, but had depreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmodestly in trade-weighted terms. The Australian dollar had reached parity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the US dollar briefly during the month, before falling back. This marked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta post-float high against the US dollar, with the Australian dollar also close\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto its post-float high in trade-weighted terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe depreciation of the US dollar had prompted concerns among policy-makers in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of countries about appreciation of their currencies and capital inflows,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas well as the prospect of destabilising capital outflows in the future. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities in Brazil and Thailand had increased taxes on capital inflows,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile the introduction of capital controls was being considered in Korea, Indonesia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand South Africa. A number of countries had continued to intervene to limit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe appreciation of their currencies, and data released over the past month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad shown a significant build-up in reserves by a number of countries during\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe September quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, the most recent data showed a continuation of the trends in bank funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had been apparent for some time. The shares of relatively high cost funds,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as domestic deposits and long-term debt, had continued to rise, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe share of short-term debt had continued to fall. Members were briefed on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments in funding costs. Most banks had reported a small reduction in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnet interest margins in their most recent half-yearly accounts, though some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad experienced an increase. Deposit competition appeared to have levelled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toff in recent months. In debt markets, spreads on short-term bank bills had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnarrowed to be not far above pre-crisis levels. Spreads on longer-term bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt had stabilised at levels that were significantly higher than before the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrisis. This was slowly adding to the banks' cost of funds as banks rolled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover debt issued earlier at lower spreads. Members noted that there was a possibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat banks would increase interest rates on loans by more than any move in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIssuance of bank bonds and mortgage-backed securities had been fairly low over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious month, partly reflecting the timing of bank profit announcements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe low level of global interest rates had allowed some companies to borrow\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin capital markets relatively cheaply at much longer maturities than had traditionally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen available.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that significant differences remained in the economic performance of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious parts of the global economy. The expansion of the US economy remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak and it was likely that the Federal Reserve would announce additional quantitative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing within a few days. Also, there were still fragilities in Europe relating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto banking sectors and fiscal positions. In contrast, the past month had provided\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther confirmation that the Chinese economy was continuing to grow solidly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was not experiencing a greater-than-expected slowdown. The outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany other emerging economies also remained positive and there had been some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in commodity prices. In relation to financial markets, members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the turmoil seen earlier in the year had continued to abate, though sentiment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained fragile.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, inflation had come in slightly lower than expected in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, partly reflecting movements in the prices of some volatile items,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding food. In underlying terms, year-ended inflation was now at the centre\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the target. The news on the real economy had been mostly positive, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan upgrade to forecasts for the terms of trade, further indications of a likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurge in resources investment, and continuing strength in the labour market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDevelopments in credit and asset markets, on the other hand, had remained subdued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, members considered that developments in terms of activity and inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere broadly consistent with the central scenario the Bank had envisaged for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome months. The outlook for growth in the resources sector was very strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand GDP growth was expected to rise gradually. While inflation had moderated,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was likely that the decline was now largely complete; inflation was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto remain around the current level for several quarters, but was likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmove higher thereafter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn previous meetings, members had discussed the likelihood that interest rates would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed to rise, at some point, if the economy continued to evolve in line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe central scenario. Based on developments over the past month and the latest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassessment of the outlook, members judged that the point at which some upward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmove in interest rates would be necessary had moved closer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs in October, a case could be made for waiting a little longer: the expected pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin domestic growth would be only in its early stages; the latest CPI outcome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been relatively good; and credit growth and housing prices were subdued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn addition, the exchange rate had appreciated over the past month, and quite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly over a longer period, which would dampen inflation pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat. There might also be a case for waiting to see if the Federal Reserve's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupcoming announcement had a significant further effect on the exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, some of the uncertainties that had been a reason to keep interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates steady over the past few months had lessened recently, even though they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not dissipated completely. Compared with several months ago, downside risks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the global economy had still not materialised in any significant way. Indeed,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe uncertainty regarding the outlook for the Chinese economy had lessened,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity markets had strengthened and the outlook for investment had firmed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith only a relatively modest amount of spare capacity in the economy, a gradual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupward trend in inflation remained likely over the medium term. If monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy was to be conducted in a forward-looking way, these developments meant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was a case for increasing interest rates at the current meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers considered that the arguments were finely balanced. However, with the flow\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof information over the past month generally suggesting that the medium-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic outlook remained one of strengthening economic activity and gradually\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising inflation, the Board judged that the balance of risks had shifted to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe point where a modest tightening of monetary policy was prudent. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that lending rates might increase by more than the cash rate, but this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttendency would not be lessened by delaying a change in the cash rate. Lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates had been rising relative to the cash rate since the global financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrisis, and the Board had taken this into account in setting the cash rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt would continue to take account of any changes in margins in its decisions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to raise the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffective 3 November.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Others,\n\t\t\t\tincluding Australia, Japan and countries of the European Union, were likely to achieve high levels of\n\t\t\t\tinoculation a little later in the year. However, many emerging market economies were unlikely to have\n\t\t\t\tsufficient access to vaccine supplies to achieve widespread inoculation for around a year or more.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the global economy was set to regain momentum over coming months, after a slowdown\n\t\t\t\taround the turn of the year induced by a resurgence in coronavirus infections in some countries. That\n\t\t\t\tsaid, the restrictions on activity reintroduced late in 2020 had resulted in less severe effects than\n\t\t\t\tthose imposed in response to the pandemic earlier in 2020. With widespread inoculation likely to be\n\t\t\t\tachieved in a number of advanced economies in coming months and substantial further fiscal support in\n\t\t\t\tthe United States in prospect, downside risks to the global growth outlook had receded. Members agreed\n\t\t\t\tthat the prospects for a sustained global economic recovery were better than a few months earlier,\n\t\t\t\talthough the path ahead was likely to remain bumpy and uneven.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the rebound in the demand for goods globally and the upturn in industrial\n\t\t\t\tproduction, particularly in China and elsewhere in east Asia, had continued to support commodity prices.\n\t\t\t\tIron ore prices remained at high levels and the prices of many other commodities, including oil, coal\n\t\t\t\tand base metals, had increased strongly in recent months. The rebound in energy prices had been\n\t\t\t\tsupported by cold weather in the northern hemisphere and the strong recovery in industrial production;\n\t\t\t\tbase metals prices had also benefited from the rebound in global industrial activity. Other input costs,\n\t\t\t\tsuch as those for shipping, had also risen sharply in preceding months.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the role that fiscal stimulus around the world had played in supporting the rise in\n\t\t\t\tcommodity prices and the more recent increase in inflation expectations. It was considered highly likely\n\t\t\t\tthat the US Congress would pass another significant stimulus bill in the near term. As a result, some\n\t\t\t\tforecasters were anticipating that inflation pressures could begin to emerge in the United States within\n\t\t\t\tthe following couple of years. In contrast, fiscal settings in some economies were expected to turn less\n\t\t\t\taccommodative in the second half of 2021.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the prospects for recent increases in commodity and other input costs to translate\n\t\t\t\t\tinto a sustained increase in consumer price inflation. This was considered unlikely for as long as\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstantial spare capacity remained in labour markets and wages growth remained subdued. The\n\t\t\t\t\tinternational experience prior to the pandemic had underscored that a sustained period of tightness in\n\t\t\t\t\tlabour markets would be needed in order to generate increases in wages growth, and, even then, would\n\t\t\t\t\tput only limited upward pressure on consumer price inflation. Even if wages growth did pick up, it was\n\t\t\t\t\talso possible that corporate profit margins in some economies could absorb an increase in labour costs\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore firms passed such costs through to final consumer prices.</p>"], "Domestic economic developments": ["<p>Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that employment had continued to recover to be around\n\t\t\t\t½ per cent below its pre-pandemic level. Full-time employment had also continued to\n\t\t\t\trecover. Much of the increase in employment in preceding months had been in Victoria following the\n\t\t\t\teasing of pandemic-related restrictions there in the December quarter. Nationally, there had been a\n\t\t\t\tsharp decline in total and average hours worked in January, which reflected more people than usual\n\t\t\t\ttaking annual leave in January following unusually low numbers of people taking leave during 2020.\n\t\t\t\tMembers welcomed the further decline in the unemployment rate to 6.4 per cent in January.

The recovery would be further supported\n\t\t\t\tby the rollout of the domestic vaccination program. However, in the near term there was some uncertainty\n\t\t\t\trelating to the effect that the end of the JobKeeper program would have on labour market conditions.\n\t\t\t\tThere was limited international experience to draw on in this regard; New Zealand had been the only\n\t\t\t\tcountry to have wound down its wage subsidy program, and very few people had been reliant on it when\n\t\t\t\tthat program ended. Members also noted that a durable recovery from the pandemic would require a strong\n\t\t\t\tand sustained pick-up in business investment.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the near-term outlook for the unemployment rate. The end of the JobKeeper program was\n\t\t\t\tseen as unlikely to result in a sustained increase in the unemployment rate. A number of considerations\n\t\t\t\tinformed this assessment. The number of people working zero hours in Australia had declined\n\t\t\t\tsignificantly in recent months to be close to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, some JobKeeper\n\t\t\t\trecipients, including the self-employed, were more likely to suffer a decline in income than lose\n\t\t\t\temployment at the end of the program. Information from liaison contacts had suggested that many firms in\n\t\t\t\treceipt of JobKeeper subsidies had already reduced the size of their workforces and were not planning on\n\t\t\t\tanother large round of lay-offs. Against this, it was likely that some jobs that had been maintained\n\t\t\t\tbecause of the wage subsidy provided by JobKeeper would cease when the subsidy ended. Members also took\n\t\t\t\tnote of the increases in forward-looking indicators of labour demand, such as job advertisements and\n\t\t\t\tvacancies. These indicators had suggested that the ongoing recovery in labour market conditions could be\n\t\t\t\tbroadly sufficient to offset the job losses arising after the end of the JobKeeper program.</p>", "<p>Members noted that wages growth had remained low, at 1.4 per cent over the year to the\n\t\t\t\tDecember quarter. Some earlier wage cuts had been reversed sooner than expected, which had boosted wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth in the December quarter, but this was concentrated in a limited number of industries. Stripping\n\t\t\t\tout the effects of temporary pay cuts and their subsequent reversal in the December quarter, wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth remained very subdued. Indeed, wages growth remained around historical lows in many industries,\n\t\t\t\tconsistent with there being spare capacity across the labour market. The share of firms in the\n\t\t\t\tBank's liaison program with wage freezes in place had remained high, and most firms had continued\n\t\t\t\tto report limited upward pressure on wages despite anecdotal reports of labour shortages in small\n\t\t\t\tsegments of the labour market. Public sector wages growth over the year to December was the lowest on\n\t\t\t\trecord, and was unlikely to pick up noticeably given the caps on wages growth in place. Members agreed\n\t\t\t\tthat a materially lower unemployment rate would be needed to generate wages growth in excess of\n\t\t\t\t3 per cent, which in turn would be required to ensure inflation was sustainably in the\n\t\t\t\t2 to 3 per cent target range.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the uneven recovery in household spending patterns arising during the pandemic.\n\t\t\t\tExpenditure on some goods, such as cars, had increased to a higher level than before the pandemic,\n\t\t\t\tcatching up from an earlier period of weakness. The consumption of other goods, such as household\n\t\t\t\tequipment, had been very strong early in the pandemic, reflecting substitution from services\n\t\t\t\tconsumption, but was now easing back towards earlier trends. Other types of consumption, including for\n\t\t\t\tsome services that had been especially constrained by the restrictions on activity, had returned to\n\t\t\t\taround or a little below pre-pandemic levels, but were unlikely to expand much further in the near term.\n\t\t\t\tMembers agreed that careful analysis of the different forms of spending would continue to be required to\n\t\t\t\tinform assessments of the sustainability of recent trends.</p>", "<p>Members noted that, following the declines in housing prices observed earlier in the pandemic, momentum\n\t\t\t\tin the housing market had picked up and price increases had become more broadly based. Price growth and\n\t\t\t\toverall housing conditions had been especially strong in the detached housing sector in outer\n\t\t\t\tmetropolitan and regional areas. This had partly reflected strong demand from owner-occupiers seeking\n\t\t\t\tmore space and from first-home buyers. Advertised rents had also picked up across the country. However,\n\t\t\t\tconditions in the apartment rental market in Sydney and particularly in Melbourne had remained subdued,\n\t\t\t\twith additional supply still being added to the stock of apartments. Members concurred that housing\n\t\t\t\tmarket conditions warranted close monitoring in the period ahead. In particular, it was important that\n\t\t\t\tlending standards remain sound in an environment of rising housing prices and low interest rates.</p>", "<p>Alongside lower interest rates, national housing market conditions had been supported by the recovery\n\t\t\t\tin the labour market and fiscal policy measures that had boosted household income and incentives for\n\t\t\t\thousing construction. Residential building approvals for detached housing had been supported by the\n\t\t\t\tAustralian Government's HomeBuilder program and other state-based programs, which would boost\n\t\t\t\thousing supply. However, approvals were expected to decline from high levels in the period ahead as\n\t\t\t\tthese stimulus programs were wound down. Once these buildings are completed, there could be a\n\t\t\t\tsignificant decline in construction activity, particularly given very low population growth. Meanwhile,\n\t\t\t\tapprovals for high-density housing construction had remained weak and there were few signs of a pick-up\n\t\t\t\tin the near term.</p>", "<p>Members noted that unusual population trends during the pandemic had materially affected national\n\t\t\t\thousing market conditions and other parts of the economy, and would continue to do so for some time. Net\n\t\t\t\toverseas migration was expected to be negative into 2022, mostly because of the projected sharp decline\n\t\t\t\tin the number of foreign students and other temporary residents. As temporary residents typically live\n\t\t\t\tin the larger cities, their absence had especially dampened demand for apartments in Sydney and\n\t\t\t\tMelbourne. Members also noted data on domestic migration in Australia showing that the population flow\n\t\t\t\tfrom capital cities to regional areas had picked up. Net domestic migration to Melbourne had also turned\n\t\t\t\tsharply negative as fewer people moved there during the pandemic. Members agreed that developments in\n\t\t\t\tnet overseas and domestic migration would continue to affect conditions in the housing market and the\n\t\t\t\teconomy more broadly for a considerable period.</p>"], "International financial markets": ["<p>Members commenced their discussion of global financial markets by considering the factors behind the\n\t\t\t\t\trecent rise in sovereign bond yields. Longer-term yields on advanced-economy bonds had increased\n\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly over preceding months, including for Australia. This had reflected growing optimism about\n\t\t\t\t\tthe economic outlook associated with the rollout of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> vaccinations,\n\t\t\t\t\ta decline in <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases in most economies and upward revisions to the\n\t\t\t\t\texpected size of US fiscal stimulus measures. The more recent rapid rise in yields had been accompanied\n\t\t\t\t\tby an increase in the volatility of yields and a decline in bond market liquidity, particularly in the\n\t\t\t\t\tUnited States.</p>", "<p>The rise in longer-term government bond yields in advanced economies over preceding months had\n\t\t\t\tpredominantly reflected an increase in compensation for future inflation. Members noted that the\n\t\t\t\tincrease in market participants' inflation expectations had been to rates closer to, though no\n\t\t\t\thigher than, central banks' targets, following an earlier period where financial market pricing had\n\t\t\t\tindicated little prospect of inflation targets being met. More recently, there had also been some\n\t\t\t\tincrease in real yields in most advanced economies.</p>", "<p>Although central banks had not announced any material changes to their asset purchase plans or guidance\n\t\t\t\ton policy rates since the previous meeting, market participants had brought forward their expectations\n\t\t\t\tfor an increase in policy rates in a number of economies, including Australia. In many advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies, the first increases in policy rates were expected to occur as early as late 2022, according\n\t\t\t\tto money market interest rates. Members noted that this change appeared to be sooner than implied by\n\t\t\t\tmarket participants' own inflation expectations and the forward guidance from central banks that\n\t\t\t\tthey would not increase policy rates until inflation had increased to be sustainably consistent with\n\t\t\t\ttargets.</p>", "<p>Notwithstanding the rise in sovereign bond yields, global financial conditions had remained\n\t\t\t\t\taccommodative. Corporate borrowing costs had remained low and equity prices in advanced economies,\n\t\t\t\t\tincluding Australia, had increased since the start of the year, despite declines late in February.\n\t\t\t\t\tEquity prices had been supported by better-than-expected earnings results and upward revisions to\n\t\t\t\t\tcorporate earnings forecasts over preceding months, consistent with the more positive economic outlook.\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the same time, investment flows to emerging markets had remained strong.</p>", "<p>In China, overall funding conditions had remained accommodative. The People's Bank of China had\n\t\t\t\t\toverseen a modest tightening in financial conditions in recent weeks, while having emphasised that this\n\t\t\t\t\tdid not signal a material shift in its policy stance. The Chinese renminbi had appreciated slightly\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst the US dollar since the start of 2021, and had remained around its highest level since\n\t\t\t\t\t2018.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the broader topic of China's evolving financial system and its global\n\t\t\t\timportance. China's policy response to the pandemic had placed more emphasis on avoiding a further\n\t\t\t\trise in risks in the financial system compared with responses during earlier downturns. The crisis had\n\t\t\t\talso placed renewed focus on the authorities' long-running efforts to reconfigure the way the\n\t\t\t\tfinancial system supported the economy, with some elements having gradually become more market-based\n\t\t\t\tover recent years. Some investors had incurred losses on investments that they had assumed were\n\t\t\t\tguaranteed by the state. Also, there had been more flexibility in interest rates, capital flows and the\n\t\t\t\texchange rate. Notwithstanding an increase in capital inflows, Chinese financial assets had remained a\n\t\t\t\tsmall share of foreign investors' holdings of foreign assets. Consistent with this, China's\n\t\t\t\tmain influence on international markets continued to be through its large trade flows. Members also\n\t\t\t\tdiscussed how China's role in the global financial system might change in the years ahead. They\n\t\t\t\tnoted that this would be affected by factors such as China's balance of savings relative to\n\t\t\t\tinvestment, the speed and extent of further easing in constraints on capital flows, and the extent to\n\t\t\t\twhich the renminbi gained wider use in international trade and finance.</p>"], "Domestic financial markets": ["<p>Domestically, yields on longer-term Australian Government Securities (AGS) had also increased\n\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly, and the spread between 10-year AGS and US Treasury yields had widened to around\n\t\t\t\t\t25 basis points. Members noted that the decline in liquidity in the AGS market, while noticeable,\n\t\t\t\t\thad not been as significant as that experienced during the period of market dysfunction in March 2020.\n\t\t\t\t\tYields on shorter-term bonds had remained anchored, although members noted that there had been some\n\t\t\t\t\tupward pressure on Australian 3-year yields late in February. This had required the Bank to purchase\n\t\t\t\t\tbonds in support of the target for the 3-year Australian Government bond yield of around 10 basis\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints, which was for the April 2024 bond. At the same time, yields on the November 2024 bond had\n\t\t\t\t\tincreased along with the increase in longer-term yields. Market participants had brought forward their\n\t\t\t\t\texpectations of an increase in the cash rate, which had also been reflected in the higher yield on the\n\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2024 bond.</p>", "<p>The Australian dollar had appreciated since November 2020 alongside the significant increase in\n\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices. Members noted that this had followed the earlier depreciation of the Australian\n\t\t\t\t\tdollar, much of which appeared to have reflected anticipation of the Bank's package of policy\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasures introduced in November 2020. The Australian dollar was assessed as being lower than it would\n\t\t\t\t\thave been otherwise as a result of the Bank's policies.</p>", "<p>The Bank had completed a little over two-thirds of purchases under the initial $100 billion bond\n\t\t\t\t\tpurchase program. Bond purchases under this program had been brought forward in the week leading up to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe meeting to assist with the smooth functioning of the market. The announcement following the\n\t\t\t\t\tFebruary meeting of an additional $100 billion bond purchase program from mid April 2021 had had\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle lasting effect on yields, which was consistent with this extension already having been reflected\n\t\t\t\t\tin market pricing.</p>", "<p>Domestically, low funding rates had continued to flow through to banks' funding costs. Some\n\t\t\t\t\tbanks had drawn down further 3-year funding under the Term Funding Facility and many had indicated that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey planned to draw down their allowances prior to the deadline at the end of June 2021. Also,\n\t\t\t\t\tborrowing rates for households and businesses had declined to new lows. Growth in housing credit had\n\t\t\t\t\tpicked up a little further in January to be 4¼ per cent on a 6-month-annualised basis.\n\t\t\t\t\tHousing loan commitments had been strong, driven by demand from owner-occupiers. Lending to businesses\n\t\t\t\t\thad been little changed over the preceding few months, after having decreased over much of the second\n\t\t\t\t\thalf of 2020.</p>"], "Considerations for monetary policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy had\n\t\t\t\t\timproved over prior months. While the path ahead was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, there were\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter prospects for a sustained recovery. Global trade had picked up and commodity prices had\n\t\t\t\t\tincreased over recent months. Nevertheless, the global outlook remained dependent on responses to the\n\t\t\t\t\tpandemic and the risks of further outbreaks of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> infection, and on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe significant fiscal and monetary support around the world. Inflation remained low and below central\n\t\t\t\t\tbank targets in many economies.</p>", "<p>Financial markets had responded to the positive news on vaccines and the prospect of further\n\t\t\t\tsignificant fiscal stimulus in the United States. Bond yields had increased considerably over February,\n\t\t\t\tincluding in Australia. This increase partly reflected inflation expectations lifting over the medium\n\t\t\t\tterm to be closer to central bank targets. The changes in bond yields globally had been associated with\n\t\t\t\thigher volatility, though with considerably less spillover to other markets than in March and April\n\t\t\t\t2020. The Australian dollar had remained at the upper end of the range of recent years.</p>", "<p>In Australia, the economic recovery was well under way and had been stronger than expected previously.\n\t\t\t\tThere had been strong growth in employment and a welcome decline in the unemployment rate to\n\t\t\t\t6.4 per cent. The December quarter GDP data were expected to show that the recovery remained\n\t\t\t\ton track. An important near-term issue was how households and businesses would adjust to the tapering of\n\t\t\t\tsome fiscal support measures. Members noted that there may be a temporary pause in the pace of\n\t\t\t\timprovement in the labour market, as many firms had already adjusted the size of their workforces.</p>", "<p>Despite these generally positive developments, members agreed that wage and price pressures had been\n\t\t\t\tsubdued and were expected to remain so for several years. The economy had been operating with\n\t\t\t\tconsiderable spare capacity and the unemployment rate had remained high. Further progress in reducing\n\t\t\t\tspare capacity was expected to occur, but it would take some time before the labour market would be\n\t\t\t\ttight enough to generate wage increases consistent with achieving the inflation target. There are likely\n\t\t\t\tto be relative price shifts due to changes in the balance of supply and demand during the pandemic, and\n\t\t\t\tthe Board would look through these transitory fluctuations in inflation. While annual CPI inflation was\n\t\t\t\texpected to rise temporarily to 3 per cent around the middle of the year as a result of the\n\t\t\t\treversal of some pandemic-related price reductions, in underlying terms inflation was expected to remain\n\t\t\t\tbelow 2 per cent over both 2021 and 2022.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the rate of wages growth that would be needed for inflation to be sustainably within\n\t\t\t\tthe 2 to 3 per cent target range. Assuming ongoing labour-productivity growth and a\n\t\t\t\tbroadly stable profit share of national income, it was likely that wages growth would need to be\n\t\t\t\tsustainably above 3 per cent, which was well above its current level. The experience of other\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies over recent years had suggested that it would take a tight labour market and\n\t\t\t\tconsiderable time for higher wages growth to be sustained. The Board's judgement was that wages\n\t\t\t\tgrowth would be unlikely to be consistent with the inflation target earlier than 2024.</p>", "<p>Since the start of 2020, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $175 billion and a\n\t\t\t\tfurther substantial increase was in prospect. The Bank had recently purchased bonds to support the\n\t\t\t\t3-year yield target and would continue to do so as necessary. The Bank was prepared to make further\n\t\t\t\tadjustments to its purchases in response to market conditions. The Bank had bought a cumulative\n\t\t\t\t$74 billion of government bonds issued by the Australian Government and the states and territories\n\t\t\t\tunder the initial $100 billion bond purchase program. A further $100 billion will be purchased\n\t\t\t\tfollowing the completion of the initial program and the Bank is prepared to do more if that is\n\t\t\t\tnecessary. Authorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $91 billion of low-cost funding\n\t\t\t\tthrough the Term Funding Facility and had access to a further $94 billion under the facility.\n\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had\n\t\t\t\tremained resilient and was helping to support the economic recovery.</p>", "<p>The Bank's monetary policy settings had continued to help the economy by keeping financing costs\n\t\t\t\tvery low, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise, supporting the supply of credit to\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses and strengthening household and business balance sheets. Monetary and fiscal policy had\n\t\t\t\tsupported the recovery in aggregate demand and the pick-up in employment. The Board remained committed\n\t\t\t\tto doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy, and would maintain stimulatory\n\t\t\t\tmonetary conditions for as long as necessary. Members concluded that very significant monetary support\n\t\t\t\twould be required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's goals for inflation\n\t\t\t\tand unemployment were achieved.</p>", "<p>Members discussed the operation of the 3-year yield target, to which the Board remained committed.\n\t\t\t\tLater in the year, members would need to consider whether to maintain the April 2024 bond as the target\n\t\t\t\tbond or shift the focus of the yield target to the November 2024 bond. The Board agreed that it would\n\t\t\t\tnot consider removing the target completely or changing the target yield of 10 basis points. If the\n\t\t\t\tBoard were to maintain the April 2024 bond as the target bond, rather than move to the next bond, the\n\t\t\t\tmaturity of the target would gradually decline until the bond finally matured in April 2024. In\n\t\t\t\tconsidering this issue, members would give close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlook\n\t\t\t\tfor inflation and employment.</p>", "<p>Members also discussed the effect that low interest rates have on financial and macroeconomic\n\t\t\t\tstability. They acknowledged the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate\n\t\t\t\tenvironment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing\n\t\t\t\tmarket. Members noted that lending standards remained sound and that it was important that they remain\n\t\t\t\tso in an environment of rising housing prices and low interest rates. The Board concluded that there\n\t\t\t\twere greater benefits for financial stability from a stronger economy, while acknowledging the\n\t\t\t\timportance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.</p>", "<p>Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as\n\t\t\t\tnecessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will not\n\t\t\t\tincrease the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent\n\t\t\t\ttarget range. For this to occur, wages growth would need to be materially higher than it is currently.\n\t\t\t\tThis would require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board does\n\t\t\t\tnot expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest.</p>"], "The decision": ["<p>The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:</p>"]}},

It was noted\n\t\t\t\t\tthat should these vaccines prove effective in practice and be made widely available on a timely basis,\n\t\t\t\t\tthis would reduce downside risks to the medium-term economic outlook.</p>", "<p>Nevertheless, infections had risen notably in a number of large advanced economies since September.\n\t\t\t\t\tHospitalisation rates had exceeded earlier peaks in many countries, and stress was being placed on some\n\t\t\t\t\thealthcare systems. Many governments had responded by tightening containment measures, including the\n\t\t\t\t\tre-introduction of full or partial lockdowns. This had contributed to a welcome reduction in the flow\n\t\t\t\t\tof new cases in Europe in recent weeks, while in the United States, where restrictions had been less\n\t\t\t\t\tstringent, numbers of new cases were yet to slow appreciably.</p>", "<p>Members noted that global economic activity had bounced back faster than anticipated in the September\n\t\t\t\t\tquarter, but the tightening in containment measures in the December quarter had resulted in a loss of\n\t\t\t\t\teconomic momentum. In Europe, some economies were now expected to contract in the December quarter.\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that, once most restrictions were lifted, the level of GDP in many economies had\n\t\t\t\t\ttended to recover to around 4 to 5 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. This sizeable\n\t\t\t\t\tshortfall reflected the remaining restrictions on some services industries as well as risk aversion and\n\t\t\t\t\tcost-cutting by firms, which had weighed on employment and investment.</p>", "<p>In Asia, differences in the industry composition of economies explained some of the variation in\n\t\t\t\t\trecovery paths. Economies with large automotive industries had experienced a slower recovery in\n\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production, compared with those whose exports of technology and electronics are more\n\t\t\t\t\timportant. It was also noted that the composition of fiscal stimulus in China had contributed to the\n\t\t\t\t\tvery strong rebound in industrial production there.</p>", "<p>Members noted that housing prices in a number of advanced economies had been surprisingly resilient\n\t\t\t\t\tthis year, and some economies had seen a notable increase in housing prices in recent months. New\n\t\t\t\t\tZealand had experienced strong ongoing housing demand from population growth, expatriate buying\n\t\t\t\t\tinterest and an earlier easing in lending standards. By comparison, these factors had been less\n\t\t\t\t\trelevant in Australia and, partly as a result, the increase in housing prices in Australia this year\n\t\t\t\t\thad been considerably smaller than in a number of other advanced economies.</p>", "<p>Members discussed how global developments had affected Australian trade since the pandemic. Early in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pandemic, weak external demand had depressed exports, while supply disruptions had affected imports\n\t\t\t\t\t(as they had in a number of economies). The imposition by Chinese authorities of import bans and other\n\t\t\t\t\tobstacles to imports of some Australian products, particularly agricultural products and, more\n\t\t\t\t\trecently, coal, had also had an effect. However, it was also noted that Chinese demand for Australian\n\t\t\t\t\tiron ore exports remained firm.</p>"], "Domestic economic developments": ["<p>Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that the recovery had established reasonable momentum,\n\t\t\t\t\taided by the lifting of restrictions in Victoria. Expectations for GDP growth in the September and\n\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarters had been upgraded over the preceding month, and employment had also recovered faster\n\t\t\t\t\tthan anticipated. At the same time, members noted that there continued to be a significant amount of\n\t\t\t\t\tspare capacity in the labour market and the economy more generally. The recovery was still expected to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe uneven and protracted, with inflation remaining low. Substantial policy support would therefore be\n\t\t\t\t\trequired for a considerable period.</p>", "<p>In reviewing recent data, members noted that the rebound in household consumption was well under way\n\t\t\t\t\tand evolving broadly as expected following a record contraction in the June quarter. A bounce-back in\n\t\t\t\t\tspending in Victoria had assisted this, consistent with more consumption possibilities opening up in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat state. Indicators such as retail trade, new car sales and payments information indicated that the\n\t\t\t\t\trecovery in consumption would continue in the December quarter; high household savings was also likely\n\t\t\t\t\tto support consumption in the period ahead. At the same time, the ability of households to consume some\n\t\t\t\t\tservices would continue to be constrained by pandemic-related restrictions. By the end of the year the\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel of consumption was still expected to be lower than a year earlier, in line with the experience of\n\t\t\t\t\tsome other economies.</p>", "<p>Members noted that conditions in the domestic housing market were improving but uneven. Regional\n\t\t\t\t\thousing prices had increased by more than those in capital cities since the onset of the pandemic.\n\t\t\t\t\tThere was also considerable variation in changes in housing prices across the capital cities, with\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions in Sydney and Melbourne more subdued than elsewhere in the country. In addition, within\n\t\t\t\t\tSydney and Melbourne in particular, conditions in the detached housing market were firmer than for\n\t\t\t\t\thigher-density markets. Overall, national housing prices had increased only a little since the outbreak\n\t\t\t\t\tof the pandemic.</p>", "<p>Members agreed that an important factor in national housing market conditions had been the slowdown\n\t\t\t\t\tin population growth as a result of the closure of international borders; this had been more\n\t\t\t\t\tconsequential in Australia than in many other economies. Members discussed how the decline in net\n\t\t\t\t\toverseas migration had affected conditions in the rental market in particular, with rents falling and\n\t\t\t\t\trental vacancy rates in inner-city Sydney and Melbourne around their highest levels in many years.\n\t\t\t\t\tRental vacancy rates were much lower in Perth, where growth in new supply had been relatively modest in\n\t\t\t\t\trecent years and international students accounted for a smaller share of rental housing demand.</p>", "<p>Members noted that the recovery in the labour market was more advanced than expected, with employment\n\t\t\t\t\thaving grown strongly in October. This was despite a tapering in the JobKeeper program and some\n\t\t\t\t\trestrictions on activity remaining in place in Melbourne during most of the month. Victoria accounted\n\t\t\t\t\tfor around half of nationwide employment growth in October, in part because of the pick-up in\n\t\t\t\t\temployment in construction and manufacturing in that state as restrictions began to be eased. Related\n\t\t\t\t\tto the stronger employment outcomes, members also noted that the rebound in the participation rate had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen surprisingly swift.</p>", "<p>Despite these positive developments, members noted that the unemployment rate had ticked up in recent\n\t\t\t\t\tmonths and that broader measures of labour underutilisation remained high. Hours worked were around 4\n\t\t\t\t\tper cent lower than before the pandemic, and many employed workers were still on reduced or zero\n\t\t\t\t\thours. The recovery in employment and average hours worked for full-time workers had been much more\n\t\t\t\t\tsubdued compared with those working part time. Members agreed that, on the whole, there was still a\n\t\t\t\t\tsignificant amount of spare capacity in the labour market and that this would remain a key policy\n\t\t\t\t\tchallenge for some time.</p>", "<p>A further indication of spare capacity in the labour market was low wages growth. Members noted that\n\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in the wage price index slowed to 0.1 per cent in the September quarter to be just\n\t\t\t\t\t1.4 per cent in year-ended terms. This was the slowest wages growth in the two-decade history\n\t\t\t\t\tof the series. Over recent quarters, the slowdown in growth in wages set in individual agreements\n\t\t\t\t\tlargely reflected wage freezes for many private sector employees and some, mostly temporary, wage\n\t\t\t\t\treductions. The slowdown in award wages growth in the September quarter had been even more pronounced\n\t\t\t\t\tthan in individual agreements, in part reflecting deferred increases for many awards. Members also\n\t\t\t\t\tobserved that if new collective agreements (mostly enterprise bargaining agreements) were established\n\t\t\t\t\tat lower rates of growth than expiring agreements, this would place further downward pressure on wages\n\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. It was noted that a substantial tightening in the labour market would be required to lift wages\n\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and inflation outcomes over the medium term.</p>", "<p>Members noted that non-mining business investment was expected to have declined further in the\n\t\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter and the outlook remained weak. Surveys of businesses' investment intentions\n\t\t\t\t\tindicated that expenditure on machinery and equipment and on non-residential construction would remain\n\t\t\t\t\tweak, although not as weak as expected a few months earlier; investment in machinery and equipment\n\t\t\t\t\twould have declined further in the absence of policy measures designed to encourage some firms to bring\n\t\t\t\t\tforward investment. Members discussed the risk that a prolonged period of weak capital investment could\n\t\t\t\t\tweigh on the economy's productive capacity over time.</p>", "<p>Members concluded their discussion of domestic economic conditions by noting that the unprecedented\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus since the outbreak of the pandemic had played a key role\n\t\t\t\t\tin supporting the economy. As part of the national fiscal response, state and territory governments had\n\t\t\t\t\trecently announced welcome additional increases in expenditure; this, combined with lower revenues, had\n\t\t\t\t\tseen the consolidated state and territory budget deficit for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> increase to around 5 per cent of output. The consolidated\n\t\t\t\t\tdeficit across the Australian and state governments in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> was\n\t\t\t\t\texpected to be around 15 per cent of GDP, a substantial increase from <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span>.

At its most\n\t\t\t\trecent policy meeting, the US Federal Reserve had judged that immediate adjustments to the pace and\n\t\t\t\tcomposition of its asset purchases had not been necessary. The European Central Bank had signalled that\n\t\t\t\tit was likely to expand some of its programs at its upcoming meeting, but a further reduction in its\n\t\t\t\tnegative policy rate was no longer anticipated by market participants. The Bank of England had announced\n\t\t\t\tan expansion of its asset purchase program in November and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had\n\t\t\t\tintroduced a program for providing long-term loans to banks. In contrast to previous months, market\n\t\t\t\tpricing had suggested that negative policy rates were unlikely to be adopted in either of these two\n\t\t\t\teconomies.</p>", "<p>Yields on long-term government bonds in the advanced economies had risen a little in response to the\n\t\t\t\tpositive news on <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> vaccines, but had remained at very low levels.\n\t\t\t\tCentral bank bond buying programs had provided some offset to the effect on yields stemming from other\n\t\t\t\tinfluences, including the ongoing high level of government bond issuance. Members noted that, relative\n\t\t\t\tto GDP, the size of the Bank's balance sheet was at the lower end of the range observed in other\n\t\t\t\tcountries, although it was now rising steadily under the bond purchase program that had commenced in\n\t\t\t\tNovember.</p>", "<p>Members noted that a range of asset prices had been supported by the more positive global outlook and\n\t\t\t\tthe very accommodative stance of monetary policy. Spreads between corporate and government bond yields\n\t\t\t\thad narrowed further. Globally, equity prices had increased strongly following the vaccine developments,\n\t\t\t\trising by at least 10 per cent in many cases, including in Australia. A reduction in\n\t\t\t\tuncertainty following the outcome of the US election, and better-than-expected earnings reports in\n\t\t\t\tadvanced economies, had also supported equity prices.</p>", "<p>Chinese government bond yields had increased and the Chinese renminbi had appreciated in recent months.\n\t\t\t\tRelatively higher interest rates and China's recent inclusion in some global benchmark indices had\n\t\t\t\tencouraged continued inflows into Chinese bond markets. Also, Chinese authorities had continued to\n\t\t\t\timprove foreign access to these markets.

Money market rates\n\t\t\t\t\thad declined to be close to zero and the yield on the 3-year Australian Government bond had fallen to\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels consistent with the Board's target, aided by the Bank purchasing $5 billion of that\n\t\t\t\t\tbond in November. In addition, $19 billion of longer-dated government bonds had been purchased\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the bond purchase program.</p>", "<p>The bond purchase program had put downward pressure on bond yields and contributed to a lower\n\t\t\t\t\texchange rate than otherwise. Yields on 10-year Australian Government Securities (AGS) had declined\n\t\t\t\t\trelative to 10-year government bond yields in other advanced countries in anticipation of the\n\t\t\t\t\tBank's bond purchase program. Since the announcement of the program, yields on 10-year AGS had\n\t\t\t\t\tremained at similar levels to those on 10-year US Treasury securities. The spread of semi-government\n\t\t\t\t\tbond yields relative to AGS had increased a little following the release of the state government\n\t\t\t\t\tbudgets, but yields had remained at historically low levels. The markets for AGS and semi-government\n\t\t\t\t\tdebt had continued to function smoothly.</p>", "<p>Members observed that average outstanding interest rates on housing and business loans had declined\n\t\t\t\t\tto historic lows. Since the start of November, announcements of reductions in borrowing rates had\n\t\t\t\t\tlargely been for fixed-rate housing loans as well as business loans under the Government's\n\t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus Small and Medium Enterprises Guarantee Scheme. Some banks had also reduced rates on a range\n\t\t\t\t\tof deposit products.</p>", "<p>Demand for housing finance had increased in recent months, particularly for loans to owner-occupiers,\n\t\t\t\t\tand credit to investors had stopped declining. Members noted that, in contrast, demand for business\n\t\t\t\t\tcredit had remained weak and business credit had declined since May, unwinding the increase over March\n\t\t\t\t\tand April, when businesses had drawn on credit lines for precautionary reasons. Payments into offset\n\t\t\t\t\tand redraw accounts had remained high in October.</p>"], "The future of money": ["<p>Members considered a special paper on the future of money and changes in the way payments are made.\n\t\t\t\tThey discussed the longer-term trend towards the use of electronic payment methods by households and the\n\t\t\t\tapparent acceleration in this trend as a result of the pandemic. Members noted that the shift from cash\n\t\t\t\tto electronic payments is further advanced in Australia than in a number of other countries. However,\n\t\t\t\tdemand for cash as a store of value had continued to grow in Australia and most other advanced\n\t\t\t\teconomies.</p>", "<p>Members discussed different possible design features for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC)\n\t\t\t\tand the associated public policy issues. They noted that there has been significant innovation in the\n\t\t\t\tAustralian payments system in recent years, including the provision of real-time account-to-account\n\t\t\t\tpayments that are available on a <span class=\"no-wrap\">24/7</span> basis. A retail CBDC might\n\t\t\t\tassist with some particular use cases, but it could fundamentally change the structure of the financial\n\t\t\t\tsystem and introduce new financial stability risks. It therefore did not appear that a public policy\n\t\t\t\tcase for a retail CBDC currently existed in Australia. Members noted that there could be stronger\n\t\t\t\targuments in favour of a wholesale CBDC and that it was important for the Bank to continue to conduct\n\t\t\t\tresearch in this area and monitor developments in other jurisdictions.</p>"], "Considerations for monetary policy": ["<p>In considering the policy decision, members observed that the global outlook remained uncertain.\n\t\t\t\tInfection rates had risen sharply in Europe and the United States and the recoveries in these economies\n\t\t\t\thad lost momentum or even reversed. However, the news about vaccines had been positive, which should\n\t\t\t\tsupport the recovery of the global economy. The recovery was also dependent on ongoing support from both\n\t\t\t\tfiscal and monetary policy. In labour markets in most countries, hours worked were noticeably below\n\t\t\t\tpre-pandemic levels. Inflation remained very low and below central bank targets.</p>", "<p>In Australia, the economic recovery was under way and recent data had generally been better than\n\t\t\t\texpected. Consumer spending had risen as restrictions were eased, business and consumer confidence had\n\t\t\t\tlifted and housing markets had generally proved resilient. Employment had been recovering strongly and\n\t\t\t\tthe peak in the unemployment rate was likely to be lower than the 8 per cent rate expected a\n\t\t\t\tmonth earlier. Nevertheless, the recovery was still expected to be uneven and protracted, and it\n\t\t\t\tremained dependent on significant policy support and favourable health outcomes. It would take some time\n\t\t\t\tfor output to reach its pre-pandemic level and an extended period of high unemployment was in prospect.\n\t\t\t\tThe high unemployment rate and excess capacity across the economy more broadly were expected to result\n\t\t\t\tin subdued wages growth and inflation over coming years. Given this environment, the Board viewed\n\t\t\t\taddressing the high rate of unemployment as an important national priority.</p>", "<p>Following the significant policy changes made at the Board's recent meetings, members decided to\n\t\t\t\tmaintain the existing policy settings. Members agreed that the Board's policy measures had lowered\n\t\t\t\tinterest rates across the yield curve, which was assisting the recovery by: lowering financing costs for\n\t\t\t\tborrowers; contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise; and supporting asset prices and balance\n\t\t\t\tsheets. The Term Funding Facility (TFF) was also supporting the supply of credit to businesses. The\n\t\t\t\tBoard's decisions were complementary to the significant steps taken by governments in Australia to\n\t\t\t\tsupport jobs and economic growth.</p>", "<p>Since the start of the year, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $130 billion.\n\t\t\t\tAuthorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $84 billion of low-cost funding through the\n\t\t\t\tTFF and had access to a further $105 billion under the facility. Over the preceding month, the Bank\n\t\t\t\thad purchased $19 billion of government bonds under the bond purchase program and a further\n\t\t\t\t$5 billion of AGS in support of the 3-year yield target. The Bank remained prepared to purchase\n\t\t\t\tbonds in whatever quantity required to achieve the 3-year yield target. Members noted that the\n\t\t\t\tAustralian banking system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was\n\t\t\t\thelping the economy traverse the current difficult period.</p>", "<p>Given the outlook for both employment and inflation, members acknowledged that monetary and fiscal\n\t\t\t\tsupport will be required for some time. The Board remains committed to not increasing the cash rate\n\t\t\t\tuntil actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For this\n\t\t\t\tto occur, wages growth would have to be materially higher than recent levels. This would require\n\t\t\t\tsignificant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. Given the outlook, the Board does\n\t\t\t\tnot expect to increase the cash rate for at least 3 years. The Board remains of the view that it\n\t\t\t\twould be appropriate to remove the yield target before the cash rate itself were increased.</p>", "<p>Members agreed to keep the size of the bond purchase program under review. At its future meetings, the\n\t\t\t\tBoard will closely monitor the effects of the bond purchases on the economy and on market functioning,\n\t\t\t\tas well as the evolving outlook for jobs and inflation.

GDP growth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquite strong outside the G7 economies in the September quarter, following a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar outcome in the June quarter, with particular strength in Asia. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas contributing to increases in commodity prices and firmer demand for Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresources exports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite the resumption of growth, there remained significant spare capacity in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies as evidenced by the high levels of unemployment and low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels of measures of capacity utilisation. Some economies, including the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates and United Kingdom, had seen relatively modest declines in inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso far, although the extent of the contraction in economic activity that had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccurred suggested that further disinflation was likely. There had been much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarger declines in inflation in some Asian economies with relatively flexible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour markets, and also in some advanced economies, most notably Ireland and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain, where initial inflation rates had been higher and where there had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarger contractions in activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDevelopments in the United States continued to suggest a gradual improvement in conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough household spending in the September quarter had been boosted by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincentives for car purchases, other components of consumption had also shown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmodest growth, and the contraction in business investment had slowed. Indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof activity in the housing market continued to suggest a stabilisation. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe unemployment rate had continued to rise, a number of other indicators suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the deterioration in the labour market was easing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the euro area, positive growth had been recorded in the September quarter, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGermany, France and Italy all recording growth but the Spanish economy continuing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto contract. However, growth thus far appeared to be mostly driven by exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the inventory cycle, with private demand still weak. Household spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas continuing to contract, with retail sales around 4 per cent lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost economies in Asia were expanding solidly. In China, while there had been a slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin investment spending after the very rapid growth seen earlier in the year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in retail spending had been strong recently. Chinese export volumes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere also rising at a solid rate, with broad-based growth to a range of destinations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in Indian GDP in the September quarter had been very strong, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testimates for Japanese growth had also been firmer than expected. A wide range\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof other economies in the region had also registered above-trend growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe September quarter. These outcomes were partly a reflection of the significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing in monetary and fiscal policies and the absence of significant impairment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the financial sectors of most of these economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that expansionary monetary conditions were leading to pressure on asset\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets in the Asian region. Lending for housing was growing strongly in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of the higher-income economies, and house prices were also growing strongly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some economies.

Members observed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe direction of the movement in the surveys was consistent with other evidence,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough the strength of the improvement had been surprising. While the surveys\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been reasonably good indicators of the pace of activity in the past, it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas possible that part of the improvement reflected relief that the earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing in the economy had been much milder than feared.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInformation on the labour market had also mostly been positive. Employment was estimated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have increased in October, and the unemployment rate had remained around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5¾ per cent for more than half a year. Surveys suggested that hiring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions of businesses were gradually picking up. However, absent a further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing in the participation rate, there could still be some increase in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate, given that, at this stage, trend growth in employment was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill running below growth in the working-age population.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed trends in retail spending. Although data for the September quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad shown a small fall in the volume of sales, and recent liaison suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmixed trading conditions since then, this had followed very strong growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first half of the year, supported by the stimulus payments to households.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMotor vehicle sales to households in October had been above the low levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseen earlier in the year, and liaison pointed to strong sales in November.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeasures of consumer sentiment remained at very high levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data on business investment pointed to a fall in spending in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, especially for non-residential building.

Engineering construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas at very high levels and likely to rise further as LNG projects picked up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent data also suggested strong growth in public-sector investment, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction spending at high levels, including spending on both educational\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfacilities and broader infrastructure.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed developments in the housing market. Estimates from private-sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata providers indicated that housing prices had continued to rise at a robust\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpace in October. Housing lending to owner-occupiers was growing at a solid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate, although growth in lending to investors was fairly subdued. Data for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals, including figures for October, which were released during\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe meeting, continued to show divergent trends: approvals for houses were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow well above the lows seen in late 2008, but approvals for apartments remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the lowest levels in more than a decade. The latter reflected both difficulties\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaced by developers in obtaining finance and the high cost of bringing new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply to market. Members also discussed the particular challenges posed by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh levels of resources sector investment, including the supply problems and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh housing prices that were already presenting challenges in some regions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness credit had again fallen in October, and was around 7 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than a year earlier.

They noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the fall in credit partly reflected a desire on the part of some businesses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto pay down debt, using internally generated funds, issuance of equity and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta drawdown in deposits, which had been at quite high levels as businesses had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier sought to build their liquidity. While supply-side factors had contributed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the fall in credit in particular sectors, such as property development,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers noted reports suggesting tentative signs of greater willingness on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe part of financial institutions to lend to these sectors.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe wage price index showed continued moderation in private-sector wage growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe September quarter, although public-sector wage growth had remained quite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirm.

Given the substantial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasset holdings of Dubai World and the size of the sovereign wealth fund of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbu Dhabi, most market participants did not regard the exposure of foreign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks to the UAE as being likely to lead to wider financial instability.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been no change in monetary policy settings in the major advanced economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month, and the expected timing of the first steps to tighten\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy by the major central banks had been pushed out to the third quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2010 at the earliest.

However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Europe, yield spreads to German government bonds had widened, most notably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Greek government bonds, following a ratings announcement, as well as concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover Greek banks' reliance on funding from the European Central Bank.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to government-guaranteed bond issuance by banks, members noted that one UK\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbank had accounted for about half of the issuance in the past month. In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States, non-government bond issuance generally had been modest in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast few months, largely reflecting the negligible balance sheet growth of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancials.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, there had been a significant amount of bond issuance by banks in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths.

These\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspreads had risen considerably in the past few months, partly reflecting global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments but also the increased demand from borrowers to bring offshore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeals back onshore. On the other side of the market, Kangaroo bond issuance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased as supranational entities had issued Australian dollar bonds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– swapping the proceeds back into US dollars had allowed them to take\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvantage of the lower borrowing costs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian securitisation markets had continued to show signs of improvement.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo more issues had occurred without the support of the Australian Office of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial Management (AOFM) and a number of other deals were pending, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverall pricing was becoming more economic as spreads in the secondary market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad declined in recent months. Issuers were looking to broaden the appeal of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential mortgage-backed securities; one recent issue featured the inclusion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a buy-back facility to reduce liquidity risk. This was designed to overcome\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta concern that had been cited by investors for not participating in this market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Government had announced that the AOFM would be purchasing a further $8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbillion of these securities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the domestic money market, the bank bill spread to the expected cash rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttended to rise over the past month.

An exception to the broad trends had been the Japanese market,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere the Nikkei had fallen since mid year as the yen had appreciated. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongest performing share markets since the recent trough had been those in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe emerging market economies, although these had fallen the most from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious peak.

The Chinese renminbi had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained essentially fixed to the US dollar, which meant it had depreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst many other currencies in the Asian region. This had prompted some of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese countries to consider restrictions on capital flows, as well as the adoption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof prudential measures to try to limit the effect of these inflows on asset\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had been volatile during the month but reached its highest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels against the US dollar, and in trade-weighted terms, since the collapse\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Lehman Brothers 15 months earlier. The strong appreciation over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear meant the Australian dollar was now only around 5 per cent below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits post-float high against the US dollar.

Increases in lending rates were generally matching increases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin overall funding costs.

The Board\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad taken early action at the previous two meetings to adjust the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a less accommodative setting. Even after those changes, and taking into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount the increase in the spread between the cash rate and borrowing rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past two years, most lending rates were still noticeably below normal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers agreed that, if developments unfolded as currently expected, monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy would need to be adjusted further over time to lessen the degree of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulus.

Members canvassed the arguments for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach course of action. They weighed the potential for adverse effects on confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a further adjustment at this time, the continuing uncertainty over the international\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook given conditions in the major economies, and the high level of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate. Members also considered the likely long-run pressures on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy from the combined demand for housing and infrastructure and resources\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector investment over the years ahead. They were mindful that the approach\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof lowering interest rates very quickly in response to the threat of serious\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic weakness needed to be accompanied by a timely removal of at least\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of that stimulus once the threat had passed, if interest rates were not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto end up being too low for an extended period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers saw the arguments as finely balanced, but concluded that the stance of monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy would best reflect the circumstances facing the economy over the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead if there were an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points at this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting. Members saw this adjustment, together with those in the preceding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo meetings, as materially shifting the stance of policy to a less accommodative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetting and, therefore, as increasing the flexibility available to the Board\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat future meetings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to raise the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffective 2 December.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

The outlook for growth in output continued to be supported by lower\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates, the recent tax cuts, high levels of spending on infrastructure, a pick-up in the housing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the improved outlook in the resources sector. However, members noted that weak growth in\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome continued to present a downside risk to consumer spending, and that a low appetite for\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisk could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe constraining businesses' willingness to invest.

However, growth in a number of economies had\r\n\t\t\t\t\tslowed this year; softer external demand, at least partly related to trade tensions and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tassociated uncertainty, had been a common driver of the slowdown. Bilateral US–China trade had\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontracted following the increase in import tariffs between the two countries, while indicators of\r\n\t\t\t\t\texternal demand, such as new export orders, had softened in the euro area, Japan and other parts of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAsia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the major advanced economies, GDP growth outcomes had diverged further in the September quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\talthough there had been some loss of momentum in external demand in all regions. In the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStates, growth had remained strong in the September quarter, driven in part by fiscal stimulus. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan, the pronounced slowing in year-ended GDP growth had been at least partly the result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdisruptions in the wake of natural disasters. One-off factors had weighed on growth in some parts of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe euro area, and business conditions and investment intentions there had also declined.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth had remained higher than growth in working-age populations across the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies and unemployment rates had edged lower from already low levels. Wages growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to increase, but, with the exception of the United States, this had not yet translated\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinto higher inflation in underlying terms. Core inflation had remained below target in the euro area\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand Japan.

Conditions had remained subdued in a number of sectors, including machinery &amp; equipment\r\n\t\t\t\t\tproduction and food &amp; clothing. By contrast, the central authorities' direction to local governments\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto bring forward public spending had contributed to a rebound in infrastructure investment, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tproduction of construction-related products had strengthened further. Infrastructure investment was\r\n\t\t\t\t\texpected to continue to support growth in coming months. Growth in investment in the real estate\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsector had continued to be driven by land purchases.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tElsewhere in east Asia, surveyed business conditions had remained around average and growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdomestic demand had generally maintained its momentum.

Iron ore prices had followed the recent decline in Chinese steel\r\n\t\t\t\t\tprices, returning to levels previously seen in mid 2018. Coking coal prices had increased over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tprevious month despite the fall in steel prices.

Oil supply from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUnited States had increased rapidly since the trough in oil prices in early 2016 and was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease further, while production from Saudi Arabia and Russia was expected to be sustained at high\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels.

In Sydney, housing prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfallen by around 9 per cent since their peak in July 2017, to be around September 2016 levels. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne, housing prices had returned to levels prevailing around March 2017, having fallen by a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle under 6 per cent since their peak in November 2017. Members observed that housing prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfallen across all price segments in Sydney, but housing prices had been fairly flat at the lower end\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof the market in Melbourne. Auction clearance rates and indicators of private-treaty activity had\r\n\t\t\t\t\talso declined a little further in both cities.

At the same time, price rises were being recorded in some other\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPreliminary data suggested that dwelling investment had continued around its recent high level in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe September quarter. Given the substantial amount of work outstanding and recent data on dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\tapprovals, dwelling investment was expected to remain around this level for at least the following\r\n\t\t\t\t\tyear or so before moderating. Liaison with developers indicated that demand for new detached housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\tin eastern Australia had eased over the previous year or so and some developers had reported that\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis decline in demand had become more pronounced. Demand for off-the-plan apartments had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly since mid 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPartial indicators, including the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) capital expenditure (Capex)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsurvey, suggested that both mining and non-mining business investment had declined in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Investment intentions for 2018/19 in the non-mining sector, as reported in the Capex\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsurvey, had been revised higher. Members noted that these revised expectations were consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsurveyed business conditions, which had remained above average, and with the relatively high levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof non-residential building approvals and work yet to be done on non-residential construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\tprojects.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that labour market conditions had continued to improve. Employment had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsolidly in October to be 2.5 per cent higher over the year. This was well above growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tworking-age population and had been driven largely by growth in full-time employment. Leading\r\n\t\t\t\t\tindicators of labour demand had continued to point to employment growth being above average over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowing couple of quarters. The unemployment rate had remained at 5 per cent in October, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sharp decline in the previous month. Unemployment rates had fallen in almost all states and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tterritories over 2018. In trend terms, the unemployment rates in Victoria and New South Wales were\r\n\t\t\t\t\tboth at their lowest levels in a decade, at around 4½ per cent. Members noted that youth employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(those aged between 15 and 24 years) had increased significantly over the previous year and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tyouth unemployment rate had declined.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWages growth had picked up a little in the September quarter. The wage price index (WPI) had\r\n\t\t\t\t\tincreased by 0.6 per cent in the September quarter to be 2.3 per cent higher over the year. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpick-up had built on the small, gradual increases in WPI growth recorded over the previous two\r\n\t\t\t\t\tyears. The 3.5 per cent increase in minimum and award wages had contributed to growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter. Joint Reserve Bank–ABS analysis suggested that wages growth for jobs covered by\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other two wage-setting methods, namely enterprise agreements and individual agreements, had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen stronger than a year earlier. This job-level analysis had also shown that, although there had\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen little change over the preceding year in the size of a typical wage increase, the share of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tworkforce receiving an increase in any given quarter had increased. Year-ended growth in the WPI had\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpicked up compared with the previous year across most industries and in all states and territories.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEven so, average earnings had increased at roughly the same rate as consumer prices over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tprevious five years or so, leaving real average earnings relatively unchanged despite moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\tproductivity growth. This had followed an extended period during the resources boom when real\r\n\t\t\t\t\taverage earnings had consistently risen faster than productivity. As a result, the gap between real\r\n\t\t\t\t\taverage earnings and productivity that had opened up during the resources boom had been largely\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclosed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers also discussed a paper on some longer-term trends in the division of aggregate income\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween labour and capital. In Australia, the share of total income paid to workers in wages and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsalaries (the ‘labour share’) had risen over the 1960s and 1970s but had gradually declined since\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthen. Over the same period, the share of income accruing to profits (the ‘capital share’) had risen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAbstracting from fluctuations associated with the terms of trade cycle, the labour and capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\tshares had been fairly stable for at least the previous decade. Although the Australian experience\r\n\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have been similar to that observed in other advanced economies, the factors driving the\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttrends had been somewhat different. Members noted that the long-run increase in the capital share in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralia had stemmed almost entirely from higher profits accruing to financial institutions (since\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfinancial deregulation in the 1980s) and from higher rents paid to landlords and imputed to home\r\n\t\t\t\t\towners (particularly before the 1990s). Members observed that the increasing use of technology to\r\n\t\t\t\t\treplace manual effort in the finance sector and long-run increases in the quality and size of homes,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tas well as a greater number of dwellings per capita, were likely to have contributed to these\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttrends. Members also noted the measurement challenges associated with both financial services and\r\n\t\t\t\t\thousing services in the national accounts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting the pick-up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbusiness credit growth in Australia in the second half of 2018. While foreign banks had been the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmain driver of growth in business lending for some time, the major Australian banks had also made a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnoticeable contribution to business credit growth in recent months. The pick-up in business lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\tby the major banks had occurred as growth in their housing lending had continued to slow. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\tobserved that lending to large businesses had accounted for the bulk of the growth in business\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcredit over preceding years and all of the pick-up in business credit growth in the most recent few\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmonths.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBy contrast, lending by banks to small businesses had increased only modestly over the preceding few\r\n\t\t\t\t\tyears and had been flat in 2018. Moreover, small businesses' perceptions of their access to finance\r\n\t\t\t\t\thad deteriorated sharply over the year, according to the Sensis survey. Members noted that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralian Government had recently announced a number of initiatives to support lending to small\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTurning to housing credit, members noted that growth in lending to investors had remained very weak\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand growth in lending to owner-occupiers had continued to ease, to be 5–6 per cent in annualised\r\n\t\t\t\t\tterms. The slowing in housing credit growth had been almost entirely accounted for by the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbanks, where the rate of growth in lending had been the slowest in many years. Housing lending by\r\n\t\t\t\t\tother financial institutions had continued to grow more strongly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the slowing in housing credit growth appeared to reflect both tighter lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions and some weakening in demand. On the demand side, declining housing prices in some\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had reduced investor demand. In this context, lenders had continued to compete for borrowers\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof high credit quality by offering new loans at lower interest rates than those offered on\r\n\t\t\t\t\toutstanding loans. On the supply side, credit conditions were tighter than they had been for some\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttime. Members noted that the focus on responsible lending obligations in response to the Royal\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCommission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto have reduced some lenders' appetite for lending to both households and small businesses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMortgage interest rates remained low by historical standards, but had risen a little for many\r\n\t\t\t\t\tborrowers in previous months, as most lenders had passed on the increase in their funding costs\r\n\t\t\t\t\tresulting from the rise in bank bill swap rates earlier in 2018.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\tunchanged for a considerable period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTurning to global financial conditions, members noted that financial conditions in the advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\teconomies remained accommodative, although they had become less so over the course of the year. A\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfew central banks had continued gradually to remove monetary policy stimulus and more recently\r\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal equity prices had declined and credit spreads had widened a little (although spreads remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\trelatively low).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tExpectations regarding policy paths of the major central banks implied by financial market pricing\r\n\t\t\t\t\thad been generally little changed over the previous month. However, in the United States the path\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the federal funds rate over 2019 implied by market pricing had moved further below that implied\r\n\t\t\t\t\tby the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' projections published following the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSeptember FOMC meeting. Recent public comments by senior Federal Reserve officials had emphasised\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat further withdrawal of monetary stimulus would increasingly depend on how the economy evolves.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that 10-year government bond yields in major markets had declined in November. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpart, this was likely to have reflected the lowering of market expectations for the federal funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\trate in 2019, as well as the recent sharp decline in oil prices and some easing in expectations for\r\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal economic growth. In the United Kingdom, uncertainty surrounding the approval of a Brexit deal\r\n\t\t\t\t\twas also likely to have weighed on long-term bond yields.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOver the year as a whole, diverging central bank policy paths and economic outlooks had seen bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\tyields in the United States rise relative to those in Europe and Japan. Consistent with this, the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdollar had appreciated by 5 per cent over 2018 on a trade-weighted basis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity prices had declined in October reflecting a range of factors, including US–China trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttensions, building cost pressures in some countries and a moderation in earnings growth expectations\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfor 2019. Also, equity valuations in the United States had earlier been somewhat elevated. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnoted, however, that the US equity market continued to be supported by strong growth in underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcorporate earnings, with analysts' expectations for earnings growth in 2019 having been revised down\r\n\t\t\t\t\tonly a little recently. In Europe, ongoing concerns about Italian fiscal policy settings, as well as\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe moderation in growth in the euro area in 2018, had weighed on equity prices, particularly for\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcompanies in the financial sector. Chinese equity prices had been declining throughout 2018,\r\n\t\t\t\t\talthough they had not fallen further in November. The decline over the year was likely to have\r\n\t\t\t\t\treflected concerns over US–China trade tensions and an easing in growth in economic activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that US corporate credit spreads had widened a little recently, although they\r\n\t\t\t\t\tremained low by historical standards. Members noted that this modest tightening in credit market\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions had occurred against a background of increased corporate leverage, with US non-financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations having increasingly sourced funding from securities markets over the preceding decade\r\n\t\t\t\t\tor so. Issuance of investment-grade bonds and, to a lesser extent, leveraged loans had been strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers also observed that securities markets had been increasingly facilitating lending to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlower-rated corporations. While Europe and Australia had also seen increases in investment-grade\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbond financing by corporations, banks remained the predominant source of corporate funding in these\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmarkets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, although overall corporate leverage in the United States had increased over\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpreceding years, it was not high compared with levels in other economies. Nevertheless, high and\r\n\t\t\t\t\trising debt-servicing burdens and the relative increase in debt owed by borrowers of lower credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\tquality were likely to have increased the vulnerability of the corporate sector to adverse future\r\n\t\t\t\t\tshocks. On the lending side, the non-bank institutional investors that had recently provided most of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe debt financing for corporations tended to have more stable funding and less leverage than banks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed implications of this for financial stability, given that, by itself, the reduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlending role of banks means that the US financial system would be better placed to withstand a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdeterioration in credit conditions than in the past. Overall, members agreed that developments in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthese markets warranted continued monitoring.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn China, growth in total social financing had slowed through much of 2018, mostly due to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraction in non-bank lending, which had previously been a key source of funding for private\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfirms. This followed earlier measures by the authorities to restrict the availability of credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\tprovided by non-bank entities in order to reduce risks in the financial system. By contrast, growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\tin bank lending, which historically had been disproportionately directed towards state-owned\r\n\t\t\t\t\tenterprises, had been stable at a solid rate for a number of years. In recent months, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tauthorities had been taking steps to encourage banks to increase their lending to the private sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(especially smaller enterprises), although members noted that, relative to smaller banks and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-bank lenders, larger banks were less accustomed to lending to this sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGlobally, the economic expansion had continued, although there had been some signs of a slowing in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tglobal trade in the September quarter. In China, the authorities had continued to ease policy in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttargeted way to support growth, while paying close attention to the risks in the financial sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that balancing these considerations remained a key challenge for the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\tauthorities. Globally, inflation remained low, although wages growth had picked up in economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\twhere labour markets had tightened significantly. Core inflation had picked up in the United States,\r\n\t\t\t\t\twhich had experienced a sizeable fiscal stimulus against the background of very tight labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions, but core inflation had remained low elsewhere. Members noted that the significant fall\r\n\t\t\t\t\tin oil prices was likely to reduce global headline inflation over the following year or so, should\r\n\t\t\t\t\tit be sustained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFinancial conditions in the advanced economies remained expansionary but had tightened somewhat\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of lower equity prices, higher credit spreads and a broad-based appreciation of the US\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdollar over 2018, as the gradual withdrawal of US monetary policy accommodation had continued. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAustralia, there had been a generalised tightening of credit availability. There had been little net\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in credit to small businesses in prior months. Standard variable mortgage rates were a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\thigher than a few months earlier, while the rates charged to new borrowers for housing were\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally lower than for outstanding loans. The Australian dollar remained within its range of\r\n\t\t\t\t\trecent years on a trade-weighted basis. Australia's terms of trade had increased over recent years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\twhich had helped to boost national income.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the Australian economy had continued to perform well. GDP growth was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tremain above potential over this year and next, before slowing in 2020 as resource exports were\r\n\t\t\t\t\texpected to reach peak production levels around the end of 2019. Business conditions were positive\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand non-mining business investment was expected to increase. Higher levels of public infrastructure\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestment were also supporting the economy. The drought had led to difficult conditions in parts of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe farm sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe outlook for household consumption continued to be a source of uncertainty because growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold income remained low, debt levels were high and housing prices had declined. Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat this combination of factors posed downside risks. Notwithstanding this, the central scenario\r\n\t\t\t\t\tremained for steady growth in consumption, supported by continued strength in labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions and a gradual pick-up in wages growth. The unemployment rate was 5 per cent, its lowest\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel in six years, and further falls in the unemployment rate were likely given the expectation\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the economy would continue to grow above trend. The vacancy rate was high and there were\r\n\t\t\t\t\treports of skills shortages in some areas.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets had continued to ease and nationwide rent\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinflation was low. Growth in housing credit was very weak for investors and had also eased for\r\n\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers, reflecting both tighter lending conditions and some softening in demand. Mortgage\r\n\t\t\t\t\trates remained low, and competition was strongest for borrowers of high credit quality.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking account of the available information on current economic and financial conditions, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\tassessed that the current stance of monetary policy would continue to support economic growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tallow for further gradual progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinflation towards the midpoint of the target. In these circumstances, members continued to agree\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the next move in the cash rate was more likely to be an increase than a decrease, but that\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthere was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. Rather, members assessed\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Bank to be a source of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstability and confidence while this progress unfolds. Members judged that holding the stance of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand achieving the inflation target over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.</p>"]}},

The pick-up had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly based geographically. Survey measures suggested that conditions in the manufacturing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors of Australia's largest trading partners had continued to improve; conditions in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tservices sectors of the major advanced economies had remained favourable. The strength of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production in the high-income economies of east Asia had been associated with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery strong growth in exports of electronics, specifically of semiconductors. The strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof demand in electronics-related industries had supported business investment and GDP growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the region, particularly in South Korea.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth in the major advanced economies had been above potential, supported by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodative monetary policies. Members noted that recent growth outcomes for the euro area\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been stronger than expected. Growth in business investment had picked up in the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced economies over the prior year and further solid growth was anticipated over coming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarters. Consumption growth had remained above average, supported by robust growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temployment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in labour markets in a number of major advanced economies had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttighten. Employment-to-population ratios had increased and unemployment rates had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto low levels in Japan, Germany and the United States, among other advanced economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that this implied there was limited spare capacity in these economies, based\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton conventional measures of full employment. However, wage growth had picked up only\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly. While observing that there were typically lags between labour markets tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand wage pressures emerging, members noted that the wage data might suggest these economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad more spare capacity than implied by conventional measures. More generally, members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the nature of work was evolving, driven partly by technological change, and that not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone was benefiting equally from the recent strength in labour demand. Low wage outcomes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad contributed to core inflation in the major advanced economies remaining low, even though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproducer price inflation had been noticeably higher.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, GDP growth had been stronger than expected over the first three quarters of 2017,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut more recently growth looked to have eased. This was particularly true of residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction activity in cities where the authorities had implemented policies to address\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuoyant housing market conditions. The output of some sectors producing inputs for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction sector, such as glass and steel products, had fallen in preceding months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProduction shutdowns designed to deal with environmental concerns had also affected crude\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsteel production. In combination, these factors had led to some levelling off of Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbulk commodity imports, including from Australia. Despite this, spot prices for iron ore had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased over the previous month and Chinese producer price inflation had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\televated, partly reflecting stronger commodity prices. Although consumer price inflation in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChina had edged higher, it remained below the authorities' objective of 3 per cent in 2017.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the wage price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindex continued to suggest that wage growth had been stable at a low rate.

The unemployment rate had edged lower to be 5.4 per cent in October, which was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits lowest level since 2013, and unemployment rates had been on a downward trend in most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstates.

Members considered macroeconomic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodelling of a scenario under which public investment was higher than forecast for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing three years. The demand effects of this scenario included the direct contribution\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto GDP growth of higher public investment, as well as the multiplier effects through higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprofits earned by private sector firms and the higher incomes earned by workers on these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects. Members noted the possibility of ‘crowding out’ of other forms of demand, but did\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot consider this a major risk given that the economy was currently operating with a degree\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof spare capacity and inflation was low. Indeed, a sustained pick-up in spending on public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure could even ‘crowd in’ additional investment by the private sector firms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundertaking those projects on the public sector's behalf.

Members noted that Chinese equity valuations had risen strongly over 2017,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut had fallen somewhat in November after the authorities had signalled their concern that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome stocks were overvalued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, housing credit growth had eased a little over the second half of 2017, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in lending to owner-occupiers had slowed somewhat and growth in lending to investors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad stabilised at a lower level than in the first half of the year. The easing in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth had been accounted for by the major banks, which had been more affected by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneed to restrain interest-only lending to comply with the supervisory measures announced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier in the year. Growth in housing lending by non-authorised deposit-taking institutions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(non-ADIs) had picked up, although these institutions' share of overall housing lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremained small. Members noted that these lenders charged higher interest rates on average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan ADIs, which is likely to reflect both the borrower risk profile and higher funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts of non-ADIs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIssuance of residential mortgage-backed securities, which are an important source of funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor non-ADIs, had been strong in 2017 and pricing of these securities had declined a little.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMajor banks' funding costs had declined a little over 2017 and long-term debt funding had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrown relatively strongly in the second half of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the Australian equity market (on an accumulation basis) had risen in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tline with global markets over the previous couple of years and that volatility had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlow over the prior year.

They noted that external finance had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecome available on increasingly favourable terms for large businesses over recent years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith foreign banks having added to competition for large business lending. Nevertheless,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness borrowing had grown only moderately, reflecting subdued mergers and acquisitions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity, with investment having been funded largely from internal sources of funds. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrast, many small businesses continued to find it challenging to obtain finance,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in their start-up or expansion phases. Members noted that this was likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treflect the riskier nature of such lending, but also the less competitive market for small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness lending. Participants on the Bank's Small Business Finance Advisory Panel, convened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tannually, had confirmed the challenges of accessing bank lending. Members observed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequity funding was often more appropriate for the risk profile of start-up businesses, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there are relatively few avenues for such financing in Australia compared with some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother markets. Members were encouraged by the potential for innovations to improve access to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfinance for small businesses and the willingness of regulators to facilitate these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdevelopments, including in the areas of comprehensive credit reporting, open banking and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talternative funding platforms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that conditions in the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy had improved over 2017 and that the outlook had also been upgraded. This improvement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been supported by expansionary financial conditions, notwithstanding some withdrawal of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary stimulus in a number of economies. In the major advanced economies, labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions had continued to tighten, but wage growth and core inflation had remained low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers recognised that this combination of strength in economic activity and low inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas a central issue in the global economy. It was possible that this combination could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue for a while yet, but it was also possible that inflation could pick up by more than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpected as spare capacity diminished.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the global growth outlook had improved, commodity prices and Australia's terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade were expected to decline in the period ahead, but to remain at relatively high levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had continued to fluctuate within its range of the preceding two and a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thalf years.

Output growth was still expected to pick up gradually over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforecast period. Business conditions were positive and capacity utilisation had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigh. The outlook for non-mining business investment had improved further and the pick-up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic infrastructure investment was also supporting overall growth. However, growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption was expected to have slowed in the September quarter and the outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold consumption continued to be a significant risk, given that household incomes were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing slowly and debt levels were high.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in employment, particularly full-time employment, had increased and the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trate had fallen to a four-year low.

To address the medium-term risks associated with high and rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold indebtedness, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority had introduced a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of supervisory measures earlier in the year and credit standards had been tightened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto lower the risk profile of borrowers.

Overall, however, conditions across the Asian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregion, including in China and Japan, had been weaker than expected this year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in the United States and the recovery in the euro area had continued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCore inflation had generally edged higher in both the advanced and emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, but remained below most central banks' targets.

There\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also been a significant decline in oil prices following a further increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin oil production. Weak investment growth across the major economic regions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay have partly explained the relatively subdued growth in world merchandise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports over the previous few years or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the manufacturing and construction sectors in China had remained subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the output of many industrial products remained below levels recorded in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014. There was overcapacity in some parts of the Chinese economy and conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere likely to become more difficult over time for a range of unprofitable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirms in these sectors. Export and import volumes were lower than they had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen in 2014, although iron ore imports from Australia appeared to have been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteady over 2015. Residential property prices overall had increased a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent months, but the stock of unsold housing was substantial in many cities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand real estate investment had remained weak.

Nonetheless,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumer price inflation had remained low and producer prices had fallen at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta faster rate recently, which was consistent with spare productive capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the industrial sector and lower commodity prices. In recent months, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese authorities had eased monetary policy further and growth in government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpenditure had increased.

Significant reclassifications of loans to investors to loans to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\towner-occupiers in recent months, reversing some of the reclassifications earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the year, made determining the current rate of growth of the two categories\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult.

Among other risks, they noted that the Irish banking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem had become highly dependent on borrowing from the European Central Bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(ECB).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe contagion from Ireland that had spread to other parts of Europe reflected the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial inter-linkages in the form of interbank exposures, as well as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEuropean sovereign debt holdings of the European banking system.

The improvement was attributed to a number\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof factors, particularly the three-year liquidity operation by the European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCentral Bank (ECB), as well as better-than-expected data on economic conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States and the start of the new year itself, with investors more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twilling to take risk after having opted to conserve their positions into year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn late December, the ECB provided about €490 billion of three-year funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto banks (against acceptable collateral) and thereby significantly reduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe funding risk for the European banking system over the period ahead. Banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had been unable to obtain funding in the market – several of which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaced sizeable maturities in the short term – were able to fund themselves\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the ECB at low cost. While this move largely dealt with the funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchallenge for European banks, a number of banks still had not addressed their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshortage of capital and had responded by continuing to shrink their balance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the sovereign debt problems in Europe persisted, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsovereign debt yields had declined from their recent peaks, in line with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral improvement in market sentiment. Negotiations around the ‘haircuts’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the private sector's holdings of Greek debt were reportedly nearing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconclusion, with an effective haircut of around 70 per cent in prospect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, Greece's adherence to the conditions of its rescue package continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto slip. The downgrade of France's sovereign credit rating from AAA by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone rating agency had little effect on yields.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment bond yields in the major advanced economies remained near their historic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlows, owing to the strong demand for highly rated government debt. This strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand had also resulted in sizeable purchases of Australian government debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby foreign sovereign asset managers in recent months. Australian 10-year yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad consequently fallen to a 50-year low, although the market for state government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbonds (semis) had not benefited from these flows, as these sovereign asset\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanagers often only purchased sovereign debt. While spreads between semis and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommonwealth Government securities (CGS) had consequently widened, the level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof yields on semis remained low, given the low CGS yields.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that a number of central banks had lowered their policy rate in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months, including the ECB, where its policy rate fell to 1 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe People's Bank of China and the Reserve Bank of India lowered reserve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequirements for banks, signalling a reversal in the direction of monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy in both countries. In Australia, the market had priced in a high probability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a reduction in the cash rate at this meeting, with further reductions expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent improvement in sentiment had seen global equity markets rise by around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7 per cent since the start of the year, after recording sizeable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlosses over the course of 2011 (with the notable exception of the US market,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been little changed over 2011).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn foreign exchange markets, the euro had depreciated against most currencies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand declined to multi-year lows against a number of currencies, including the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyen and the Australian dollar. Members noted that, in Australia's case,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe currency had reached its highest level in more than 20 years against both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe euro and the pound. More generally, the Australian dollar had appreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst most other currencies in recent weeks and approached the multi-year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeaks reached in 2011. This occurred notwithstanding the fact that commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices and the terms of trade were off their highs, with purchases of Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsovereign debt by overseas buyers an important influence on the exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that, while sentiment had generally improved, there had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen a marked repricing of bank debt globally. Following the dislocation of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbank debt markets globally in the latter part of 2011, issuance had picked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup significantly in January, but the spreads at which bank debt was issued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere significantly higher than in the middle of 2011. The Australian banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad issued sizeable amounts of covered bonds in a number of offshore markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent weeks at these higher spreads. Furthermore, the cost of swapping\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds raised in offshore markets into Australian dollars had increased in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths. There had also been two large issues of covered bonds in the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket, which had repriced the local bank debt curve significantly higher.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOver the same period, Australian banks continued to compete actively for deposits,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich resulted in the reductions in most deposit rates not fully matching the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent reductions in the cash rate. Collectively, these developments had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks' overall cost of funding relative to the cash rate and had narrowed the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifference between banks' lending rates and funding costs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the financial situation in Europe remained fragile, the likelihood of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan extremely bad outcome seemed to have diminished somewhat over the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcouple of months, partly reflecting actions by the European policymakers. This,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with stronger economic data from the United States, had provided a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmild boost to confidence in financial markets. Growth in China had moderated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas intended, but on most indicators had remained quite robust through the second\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf of 2011. While there were still many uncertainties, the central forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas for growth in the global economy in 2012 to be about ½ percentage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint below trend.

Conditions had remained generally firm in China, but slowing exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Europe and the disruption to supply chains from the floods in Thailand had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweighed on activity in much of east Asia, though there were tentative signs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat activity and exports had picked up since December.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite data on the Chinese economy being more difficult to read than usual owing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the early timing of the Lunar New Year, it appeared that the Chinese authorities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been successful in slowing growth to a more sustainable pace. The property\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket remained subdued, in large part reflecting administrative controls,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding restrictions on access to credit by property developers and limits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton purchases by existing property owners.

On the one hand, the terms of trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboom had underpinned strong investment in mining-related sectors. Investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintentions also remained strong, with the capital expenditure survey suggesting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in the mining sector in 2012/13 would be well above the already\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\televated levels.

On the other hand, the associated high exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate had weighed on other trade-exposed sectors, including manufacturing, tourism\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand education, with services exports having fallen significantly since 2008.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestment intentions in the non-mining sectors remained subdued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA survey-based measure of consumer confidence rose to around average levels in February,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough consumers' perceptions about their personal finances were still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treported as below average, partly reflecting some concerns about prospects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor unemployment and general uncertainty about the global outlook. Retail sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had softened since mid 2011, with notable weakness in parts of the industry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding department stores and retailers of household goods.

However, growth in Australia's major trading partners,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweighted by shares of merchandise exports from Australia, was expected to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround average in 2012. This would be underpinned by the continued economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecovery in the United States, the prospect of still-solid growth in China,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a recovery in activity in other parts of east Asia following temporary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply shocks. The financial problems in Europe continued to be a potential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsource of adverse shocks to the world economy, despite downside risks to near-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal growth having receded somewhat over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in the Chinese economy had clearly slowed over the past six months in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresponse to a policy-induced softening in domestic demand and weaker external\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand. Export volumes had been broadly flat for much of the past year, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficial efforts to cool housing demand had led to a gradual decline in turnover\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand dwelling prices in coastal cities. Recent indicators, however, suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat growth in investment and retail sales had been steady for some time now,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile growth in industrial production had stabilised at somewhat lower levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrude steel production had recovered from earlier falls and iron ore imports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained elevated. Inflation had eased in recent months to below the authorities'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4 per cent target, reflecting a decline in food prices as well as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome easing in non-food inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn east Asia, the pace of activity appeared to have picked up in early 2012,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough the data remained difficult to interpret given the early timing of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Lunar New Year.

After solid growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin business investment through much of 2011, investment indicators had softened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin early 2012. In contrast, consumption growth had picked up. Importantly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market indicators had continued to improve. Non-farm payrolls rose by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan average of around 250,000 a month in January and February, but remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore than 5 million below the previous peak.

Since the start of 2012, spot prices for coal had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen by 6–7½ per cent, but iron ore prices had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby around 10 per cent. Over the same period, Tapis crude oil prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased by 14 per cent, to US$134 per barrel, in part reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns about future supply from the Middle East. To the extent that higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toil prices reflected concerns about supply, they were adding to the downside\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks to the global recovery and upside risks to headline inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the national accounts for the December quarter had shown an increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin real GDP of 0.4 per cent in the quarter and 2.3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year, which were both lower than expected. Private domestic demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad grown strongly over the year, led by growth in mining investment. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in exports over 2011 had been weaker than expected, mainly because of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower coal exports, which, in turn, reflected a slower recovery from the floods\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Queensland in early 2011, together with a slower take-up of new rail and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tport facilities in NSW and Queensland. Service exports had also been weak,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting a decline in the number of visas for foreign students as well as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effects of the higher exchange rate and lower external demand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe national accounts showed that household consumption spending on both goods\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand services increased by around 3½ per cent over the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto December. This was a little higher than the rise in disposable income over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same period, and it was also stronger than suggested by other partial indicators,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding the Bank's retail liaison. More recent indicators show that consumer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentiment fell in March to be a little below its average level, with household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns regarding future unemployment at their highest level since mid 2009.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers spent some time exploring reasons for the weakness in many of the indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor housing turnover and building activity across Australia. They noted the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparent sensitivity of developers to the outlook for dwelling prices. New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelling construction had fallen in the December quarter and there was little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsign of a pick-up in building or loan approvals, though house prices had shown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome signs of stabilising recently. While auction clearance rates in Sydney\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Melbourne had picked up a bit of late, they remained below their average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndicators of business activity had been mixed. While business surveys suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat overall conditions remained at average levels, there were significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferences across sectors and business confidence remained somewhat below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage. Mining investment had increased by around 60 per cent over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2011 and, with a large number of projects already at a commitment stage, resource\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment and export volumes appeared likely to increase further in coming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. In contrast, the level of non-mining investment had been flat over 2011,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand recent surveys of business intentions suggested that non-mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas likely to remain sluggish for some time. Business credit growth had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly over recent months, but remained low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExports had grown modestly in recent months, in part reflecting disruptions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the supply of bulk commodities. While preliminary data for February suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat coal exports from Queensland had now returned to their pre-flood levels,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction was still being affected by industrial action in Queensland and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta shortage of explosives in NSW. In addition, export volumes of iron ore in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe March quarter had been affected by cyclone activity, while service exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been affected by the sharp fall in the number of international students\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia over the past year or so, with no indications that this would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe reversed in the near term. In contrast, the outlook for rural exports remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong following a large winter crop and good rains across the eastern states.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market conditions remained subdued, with employment falling by 15,000 in February\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand showing little change for much of the preceding year; increases in employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin mining, health and public administration had broadly offset declines in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment in manufacturing, retail trade and accommodation &amp; food services.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite this, the unemployment rate had remained at around 5¼ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor more than six months. Members noted, however, that an easing in average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thours worked and a decline in the participation rate were indicative of a softer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market than that implied by the unemployment rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been little new information on wages and prices this month. Recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness surveys and liaison indicated that firms expected wages to continue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto grow at around, or a little slower than, their recent pace.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of financial markets with developments in sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt markets. They noted that the debt restructure in Greece went as well as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould have been expected. With most private holders of Greek bonds agreeing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto participate in the Greek debt restructure, the Greek Government was able\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto trigger collective action clauses to force the remainder to participate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a consequence, three-quarters of Greek debt was now held by official entities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe debt restructuring in Greece was deemed a ‘credit event’, triggering\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit default swaps. Despite earlier fears, members noted that this process\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have occurred smoothly. Among the other peripheral European countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain's sovereign debt had come into sharper focus over the past month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting a deterioration in the Spanish fiscal position as economic activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere declined.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in private-sector credit markets had continued to improve, bolstered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the European Central Bank's second three-year liquidity operation. Corporate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond spreads had narrowed further and were now significantly lower than at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning of the year, though still higher than in the middle of 2011,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly for banks. The improved conditions in markets over the past month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad led to a high volume of bond issuance. The Australian banks had taken advantage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the improvement in funding conditions to issue a large volume of secured\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand unsecured debt. Members were briefed on the significant fall in the relative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost of that issuance since the start of the year – around 50 basis points\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a five‑year issue – which would help to alleviate the pressure of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher funding costs in coming months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that a major near-term determinant of funding cost pressures for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian banks would be the pricing of term deposits. Bank deposits now accounted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor more than half of banks' overall funding, with the share having increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom 40 per cent in 2007; within that, term deposits had risen from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t30 to 45 per cent of the total. As a consequence of banks competing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taggressively for term deposits, their cost had risen materially relative to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cash rate. The relatively short average maturity of term deposits meant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat any changes in deposit pricing would flow through relatively quickly to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe whole of the banks' deposit books.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEquity prices in the United States rose by a further 3 per cent over the month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the S&amp;P 500 recording one of its strongest quarterly rises, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Australian equity market had not experienced similar increases in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimes.

The US economy had continued to expand at a moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpace. Indications were that growth had slowed to a more sustainable pace in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina, and activity had generally picked up elsewhere in east Asia. Even so,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity in the euro area was still contracting. Global inflation pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained subdued, despite some boost to headline measures from elevated oil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices. With financial markets remaining unsettled, the risks emanating from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope continued to cloud the global outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn April, the IMF lifted its forecasts for global growth to 3.5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2012 and 4.1 per cent in 2013, with small upward revisions for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth years since its January forecasts. As had been the case in recent years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerging market economies, particularly in Asia, were expected to be the main\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriver of global growth. The IMF continued to see the balance of risks to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal economy weighted to the downside.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Europe, aggregate measures of consumer confidence had improved and exports had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up. Retail sales and investment indicators had steadied at lower levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe combination of this and the deterioration in business conditions was indicative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof ongoing contraction in output of the region as a whole. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile European leaders had made some progress in addressing fiscal imbalances\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand implementing structural reforms, much work still needed to be done. Further,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe task continued to be complicated by the negative feedback loop between\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal consolidation, private-sector deleveraging and weak growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor the US economy, members noted that GDP growth had slowed slightly in the March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, which, along with other data, confirmed that growth had been a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow trend. Labour market conditions remained positive, which had been supporting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption, although indicators of business investment and flat industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction suggested that growth had slowed in recent months. Members observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the housing market would probably continue to weigh on economic activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some time, with a large number of mortgages still in foreclosure. Furthermore,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty regarding the legislated fiscal consolidation in 2013 was another\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfactor likely to weigh on household and business confidence during the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in China had moderated to a more sustainable pace, with GDP growing by 1.8 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter, to be 8.1 per cent higher over the year. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowdown was largely attributed to slower growth in domestic demand, as had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen intended by the Chinese authorities through tighter domestic policies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the residential property market remained weak, with property\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices continuing to fall. Activity in the rest of east Asia continued to recover\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the natural disasters in 2011, which had disrupted supply chains throughout\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe region. Business and consumer confidence had generally improved, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports had been supported by a pick-up in demand from the United States.

The spot price for iron ore had continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrift higher since the start of the year, consistent with signs of a recovery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Chinese steel production as well as some supply disruptions in Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Brazil. In contrast, coking coal prices had softened as supply from Queensland\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad returned to its level prior to the flooding in early 2011, and base metals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had trended lower in recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the available indicators suggested that the domestic economy had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen growing modestly in early 2012, although the pace of activity had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto vary significantly across industries. The mining sector remained exceptionally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong, with work progressing on the very large pipeline of committed projects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand capital imports rising strongly.

Conditions remained particularly difficult in parts of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe building, construction and manufacturing industries, as well as for many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretailers. Survey measures also pointed to a softening in conditions in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness services sector, consistent with weakness in property markets and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe non-mining sectors more generally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in consumer spending had eased in the December quarter and recent indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that consumption growth was a little below trend in early 2012, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumers evidently concerned about their personal finances and job security.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsistent with this, the value of retail sales, which had been one of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweakest components of consumption over the past year, was soft in January and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the continued weakness in the housing market generally and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential building activity in particular. Demand for housing finance had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teased in the past few months and recent data suggested that dwelling prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued to decline, although there were tentative signs that the pace\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof decline had been more gradual overall in recent months. Despite dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices declining relative to incomes and rises in rental yields, forward-looking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators implied little prospect of an imminent recovery in housing construction.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInformation from liaison suggested that households were unwilling to commit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto contracts for new dwellings because of concerns about job security and declining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelling prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth had picked up a little in the March quarter. Together with a small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfall in the participation rate, this had left the unemployment rate at around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5¼ per cent. The decline in participation along with weakness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin trend hours worked were indicators of some increase in spare capacity in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe labour market in recent months. Members noted that the data showed evidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof structural change, as employment in the mining sector had expanded rapidly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile firms in a number of other sectors were responding to heightened competitive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures by reducing employment in an effort to contain costs and improve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproductivity. Leading indicators, such as surveys and job vacancies, painted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta mixed picture, but generally suggested modest employment growth in the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInflation in the March quarter was lower than expected, with various measures showing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderlying inflation of around ¼ per cent in the quarter and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2–2¼ per cent on a year-ended basis. The headline CPI\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell by 0.2 per cent in the quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be 1.6 per cent higher over the year. A large fall in fruit prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin particular banana prices, had subtracted 0.3 percentage points from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarterly inflation. More generally, tradables prices declined, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth the softness in consumer demand and further pass-through of the earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate appreciation, with the prices of some household goods, clothing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand overseas holidays all falling in the quarter. Non-tradables prices, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrast, increased by 0.7 per cent in the quarter and by 3.5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year, underpinned by relatively large increases in a range of services\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices but with falls in the prices of domestic travel &amp; accommodation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand new dwellings. The slowing in non-tradables inflation, and some of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in tradables prices, appeared to indicate that there had been pressure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton margins owing to the relative softness in demand in the non-mining sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. The central estimate was for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP to grow by around 3 per cent over 2012 and 2013, although employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was expected to remain subdued in the near term. Forecasts of mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment had been revised higher, with information from liaison and ABS data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicating more work in the pipeline than had previously been expected. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was anticipated to provide stimulus to a number of other sectors,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut growth outside of the mining sector was expected to be below trend in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnear term, affected by the high exchange rate, softer government spending and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued conditions in the housing market and building industry more generally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe forecast for export growth had been revised lower, largely reflecting a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treassessment of the ability of mining companies to utilise new port and transport\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity fully in the near term, along with weaker manufacturing exports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the expected outlook for inflation was somewhat lower than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe previous forecast made in February. Underlying inflation (excluding the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect of the carbon price) was forecast to remain within the lower half of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe target range over the next few years, staying close to the recent rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof inflation over the next year before picking up a little later in the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod. Headline inflation would be affected by a number of one-off factors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the near term. The unwinding of the earlier spike in fruit prices would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thold down year-ended inflation in the first half of 2012, followed by the introduction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the carbon price from the September quarter, which was expected to boost\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theadline inflation by around 0.7 percentage points and underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby around ¼ percentage point over the year to June 2013.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSentiment in global financial markets deteriorated in April, following several months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof improvement. Members noted that the deterioration had not been triggered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby any particular event but, rather, it reflected renewed concerns about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinter-related state of public finances and weakness of economic activity in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe euro area. This had been most evident for Spain and Italy, where yields\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton government bonds had risen significantly as foreign investors reduced their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposures by not rolling over maturing debt and selling debt in the secondary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImminent elections in France and Greece had spurred further concern on the part of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors, with a risk that parties supportive of the Greek assistance package\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould not be able to form a new government. Investors had also focused on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNetherlands following the resignation of the Dutch Prime Minister and cabinet\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of an inability to agree on fiscal austerity measures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReflecting the concerns about the euro area, as well as some weaker-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata in the United States and China, government bond yields for the major advanced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies had declined. Yields on US 10-year bonds had fallen below 2 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain, while yields on 10‑year bonds in Germany fell to historic lows. In Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe expectation of a reduction in the policy rate had resulted in government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yields declining by more than those in overseas markets, with the yield\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton 10-year Australian government debt falling to a 60-year low of 3.64 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYields on Australian state debt also fell to multi-decade lows, even though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspreads to Australian government debt had widened a little over the month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that bond issuance by Australian banks had been lower in April, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis followed particularly strong issuance in recent months and in part reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan issuance blackout ahead of three of the major banks announcing their profit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresults. Deposit rates at Australian banks remained relatively high, with no\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsign of competitive pressures easing. Reflecting this, banks' margins were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\testimated to be somewhat narrower than in the middle of 2011, notwithstanding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent increases in some lending rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity markets declined in April, reflecting some large falls in Europe and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJapan. Australian equities had outperformed global markets over this period,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmainly because Australian bank share prices had risen compared with large falls\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobally for banks, particularly in Europe.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrency markets generally had been less affected by the deterioration in global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentiment, although the yen was again appreciating, reversing some of its depreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier in the year. Members observed that the Chinese renminbi had been broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunchanged over April and that the authorities had announced a wider trading\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tband for the currency. The Australian dollar had also been relatively steady,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining at a high level both against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis, despite the lower-than-expected inflation data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn domestic monetary policy, members noted that the market was more than fully pricing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a 25 basis point reduction in the cash rate in May, with a 40 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchance of a 50 basis point reduction.

Conditions were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak in the euro area, and the risk of an escalation of sovereign debt problems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained. Prospects were for the US economy to continue its gradual recovery,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile growth in China was likely to be slower than in recent years but on a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore sustainable footing. Growth in the rest of Asia was expected to increase,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespite continuing to be restrained somewhat by the trade and financial linkages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the advanced economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent evidence suggested that the Australian economy was growing somewhat below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrend.

Elevated competitive pressures had kept deposit rates in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia high relative to the cash rate. At the margin, wholesale funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts had declined over recent months, though they remained higher, relative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto benchmark rates, than in mid 2011, and the lagged effects of this were still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworking their way through the funding structure. The rise in funding costs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad led banks to increase their lending rates over recent months by around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10–12 basis points.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe March quarter CPI had confirmed that, in underlying terms, inflation had slowed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover recent quarters after a rise during the early part of 2011.

Members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat weaker-than-expected economic data, particularly for China, had also weighed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton sentiment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe inconclusive parliamentary elections in Greece and the public backlash against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tausterity measures there had increased public discussion about Greece's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible exit from the euro area. A critical issue if Greece were to exit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be the ability of the European authorities to limit the contagion to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother euro area countries. In the case of Spain, members observed that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been increased concerns about the sustainability of the country's fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition, with one of the largest banks having to be recapitalised by the Spanish\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment. That task had complicated Spain's efforts to reassure financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets that it could contain the problems in its banking system while strengthening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic finances. As a result, Spanish bond yields had risen back to the highs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecorded in the second half of 2011.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReflecting the increased risk aversion across global financial markets, government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yields in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom fell markedly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith 10-year bond yields reaching historic lows during the month.

Australian share prices fell broadly in line with overseas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets; resources stocks, in particular, declined with lower commodity prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand concerns over Chinese growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had depreciated by around 5 per cent since the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard meeting – in contrast to the resilience it had displayed in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod of heightened risk aversion earlier in the year. European, emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket and other commodity currencies had also depreciated against the US dollar,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand by more against the Japanese yen. The renminbi had also depreciated slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the US dollar but, given the movement in the US dollar over the month,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad appreciated in trade-weighted terms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNotwithstanding the general widening in corporate bond spreads in Europe and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States, there had been little sign of dislocation in Australian credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets. There had been solid issuance in the asset-backed securities markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby both large and small banks. The major banks continued to access overseas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, though they did not have to raise significant volumes given the large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamount of funding that occurred in the March quarter and the modest growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin credit. Members noted that, as has been the case for the past couple of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears, the Australian banks were using new bond issuance only to cover maturities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand were funding credit growth through deposits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShort-term interest rates in Australia had fallen sharply following the Board's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecision in early May to lower the cash rate by 50 basis points.

As a result, the average interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate on outstanding housing loans at present was about 40 basis points below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe post-1996 average, while rates on small and large business loans were 30\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 60 basis points lower, respectively.

As attention also shifted to the sustainability of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain's fiscal position, European leaders were trying to develop a comprehensive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy response to the crisis, with Germany still reluctant to contemplate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant adjustments to the existing approach. Members observed that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing tensions were occurring in the context of ongoing weakness in economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity in the region, although the recently released economic data mostly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpre-dated the latest developments. Euro area GDP was flat in the March quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a rise in German GDP offset by falls in many other countries; the euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarea PMIs declined significantly in both April and May; and unemployment rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutside of Germany had generally continued to rise, remaining well over 20 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Greece and Spain.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent indicators suggested that the pace of recovery in the United States had eased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslightly.

There had been some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing in the rate of employment growth and little change in the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate. In the housing market, there were signs that both activity and prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad improved, albeit from a low base. The outlook for the US economy remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclouded by the large fiscal consolidation that would start from next year unless\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCongress amended existing legislation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOutside of China, economic activity in east Asia had strengthened in the early part\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2012 following the recovery from the natural disasters in 2011, but it remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to gauge the ongoing pace of expansion.

The Indian economy had continued to expand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a moderate pace, though with weakness evident in the services and exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors and in the outlook for investment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the recent data indicated that the pace of growth had slowed a little further,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had prompted an easing in financial and fiscal policies. Industrial production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin April was weaker than expected, controls on the property sector were weighing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton construction activity somewhat and manufacturing PMIs fell in May. Even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso, retail spending remained resilient. Exports to Europe – China's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlargest trading partner – continued to weaken in April, although the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrend in exports to other destinations remained positive. In response, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation pressures having abated, the authorities there had taken measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto support demand: reserve requirement ratios were lowered by 50 basis points\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(for the third time since December), additional subsidies for household consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere announced, and the Government appeared to be preparing to boost infrastructure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment. Members noted that there was some scope for an easing of China's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal and financial policies to ensure that growth did not slow much further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the near term. However, given the experience following the large fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpansion announced in late 2008 – in terms of the resulting housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboom and inflationary pressures more generally – the authorities were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to ease policies in a more measured way than was the case in the earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tepisode.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe softening in global activity had been associated with a general decline in commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices.

While part of the fall in iron ore prices reflected an easing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin earlier supply disruptions in Australia and Brazil, economic weakness in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope and an easing in Chinese steel prices had raised concerns about near-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand.

In line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferences in labour market conditions across the country, the pace of private-sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twage growth had picked up across a broad range of industries in Western Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough, relative to other states, the difference in the rate of growth of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twages was less marked than it had been in 2007–2008. Fair Work Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannual wage review announced a 2.9 per cent increase in the minimum\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twage and award wages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe underlying cash balance of the Australian Government Budget was expected to shift\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom a deficit of 3 per cent of GDP in 2011/12 to a surplus of 0.1 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof GDP in 2012/13. However, various publicly available estimates suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the direct impact of the fiscal consolidation on the economy was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be considerably less than the headline figures implied.

Overall, data on the domestic economy appeared to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly consistent with the Bank's most recent forecasts. In particular,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth was picking up gradually, but the unemployment rate was still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to move somewhat higher over the coming quarters. Output growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to increase towards trend over the remainder of this year, and inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(excluding the impact of the carbon tax) was expected to remain in the lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of the 2–3 per cent range.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board considered whether the recent information warranted a further reduction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cash rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe arguments were finely balanced. Recent domestic data generally had not suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta significant weakening in conditions compared with the forecasts a month earlier.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, there had not been time to assess the effects of the earlier reductions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cash rate. However, there was clear evidence suggesting a softening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin global conditions, and uncertainty about the future in Europe had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly. While spillovers had been limited thus far, there was a reasonable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikelihood that the tendency toward precautionary behaviour both abroad and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat home would intensify. Given this, and with inflation expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the lower part of the targeting range over the next year or so, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered that there was scope for monetary policy to be a little more supportive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof domestic activity. Members judged that a reduction in the cash rate of 25\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis points, combined with the earlier reductions, would mean that monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy would be providing a measure of stimulus that would be expected to flow\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough to the domestic economy over the coming months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffective 6 June.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had also slowed, with retail sales only a little higher in recent months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand consumer sentiment having fallen in June. A more positive development was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there were further signs of stabilisation in the housing market; house\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices were no longer falling and activity was trending up modestly, albeit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom historically low levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese exports continued to grow after softness through most of 2011.

The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproperty market had shown tentative signs of stabilising, with total sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolumes picking up. As inflation had eased further, authorities had shown their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twillingness to provide some additional support to economic activity, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough reductions in benchmark lending interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in economic activity in the rest of east Asia had been subdued after recovering\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the supply disruptions last year. Industrial production had been broadly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunchanged since January, and outside of Japan there were signs that growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin domestic demand had slowed a little. Members observed that exports had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen affected by lower demand from Europe and the United States. In Japan,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicators of domestic demand had generally been a little stronger in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths and concerns about electricity shortages over the summer had been alleviated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat by the scheduled re-opening of two nuclear reactors.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile commodity prices overall had been broadly unchanged over the past month, earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclines meant that Australia's terms of trade were estimated to have declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little further in the June quarter, although they remained at historically\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh levels. Iron ore prices were little changed over the past month, after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalling sharply in May. Reflecting weaker global demand, prices for oil and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthermal coal had fallen substantially. In contrast, spot prices for coking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoal had increased, in part owing to supply concerns related to industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taction in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that data released over the past month suggested that the domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy had been growing more strongly since the middle of 2011 than had previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen indicated. According to the national accounts, which were released the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday after the June Board meeting, GDP grew by 1.3 per cent in the March quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand by 4.3 per cent over the year, with the annual outcome boosted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the recovery in coal exports following the floods in early 2011. The stronger-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannual outcome also reflected an upward revision to growth in the second half\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2011, to around trend pace. Business investment and consumption both grew\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaster than expected in the March quarter. However, consumer and business sentiment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand other timely indicators of activity suggested that the economy was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto record slower growth in the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe divergence between the resource and non-resource economies was apparent in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnational accounts and continued to be reflected in business surveys, with conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin mining and transport well above average, while conditions in construction,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail trade and manufacturing were well below average. Members, however, noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat according to one major business survey, the dispersion of business conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross industries was well within historical norms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough survey measures of overall business conditions remained somewhat below average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels, members observed that the pace of business credit had picked up noticeably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past four months after a long period of weakness. In response to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent reductions in the cash rate, business lending rates had fallen to below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHousehold consumption grew strongly over the year to the March quarter, across both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoods and services. The strength in goods consumption was somewhat at odds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a range of partial indicators and the Bank's retail liaison over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame period, though more recent liaison had a stronger tone. One possibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed by members was that discounting had increased sales volumes but this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeant that the growth in the value of sales had been modest. Members were informed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, despite weak consumer sentiment in recent months, recent data suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat some of the strength in consumption observed earlier in the year had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that household incomes continued to be supported by relatively favourable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the labour market. The unemployment rate remained a little above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5 per cent in May, and the ratio of employment to population had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up since the beginning of the year. The ABS had recently indicated that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit had had difficulties deriving accurate real-time estimates of the working-age\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation used to calculate employment estimates from the labour force survey.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBecause of this, the published estimates appeared to be slightly understating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth. Forward-looking indicators and liaison implied modest employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth over coming months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast, indicators suggested that the housing market remained subdued. Dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity was likely to have fallen further in recent months and indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally suggested that activity would remain relatively weak in the near\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm. Notwithstanding an apparent tick-up in June, dwelling prices were around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6 per cent lower than in early 2011, with the largest falls in Melbourne\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Brisbane. Household credit continued to grow at around the pace of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast year (broadly in line with incomes). Interest rates on housing loans were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround 50 basis points below their 15-year average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers began their discussion of financial markets by noting that the resolution\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof uncertainties surrounding the Greek election and the long-awaited Moody's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdowngrade of global banks had helped ease some of the recent tensions in financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets. While the announcement by Spain of a request for support for the banking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector had done little to alleviate concerns about Spain's fiscal problems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the plight of the euro area more generally, the subsequent announcement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby European leaders at the end of June about plans to establish a separate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpan-European banking supervisor did substantially boost market sentiment, at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleast for a time. Members noted that the creation of such a supervisor might\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlead to financing being provided by the European Stability Mechanism directly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto European banks, rather than through sovereign governments, and thereby avoid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing the leverage of individual sovereigns. In response to recent developments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpanish 10-year government bond yields fell to around 6.4 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the end of June, after having reached a euro-era high of more than 7 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring the month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe European developments also caused major equity markets to rise noticeably and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment bond yields in the major advanced economies to increase from their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistoric lows. In Australia, members noted that bond yields had also increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom their historic lows, reflecting both offshore developments as well as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger domestic economic data. Foreign demand for Australian bonds continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rise, with foreign investors holding slightly more than three-quarters of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommonwealth Government bonds on issue at the end of March.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCorporate bond spreads in the United States and Europe had generally narrowed a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin June, although issuance in Europe had been very low, with little unsecured\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuance by banks in particular. Moody's downgraded the ratings of 15 global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks by between one and three notches during the month, with one bank downgraded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby three notches. This outcome was, at the margin, a little better than feared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand therefore did not have a significant effect on the market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn foreign exchange markets, members noted that, despite the situation in Europe,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe euro had appreciated slightly against the US dollar. There had, however,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen substantial outflows from the euro to the Swiss franc, particularly in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMay, which had led the Swiss National Bank to make large purchases of foreign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange to defend its ceiling of 1.20 Swiss francs to the euro. Similarly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Japanese authorities had reiterated their willingness to intervene in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeign exchange market to limit upward pressure on the yen. The Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar appreciated over the month, bolstered by positive domestic economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata and further buying of Australian government debt by offshore investors.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe difficulties in Europe, together with the run of generally weaker-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal economic data, had led the major central banks to take a number of policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactions over the past month to provide further monetary stimulus. The Federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve had announced a continuation of its Treasury securities purchase program.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, the People's Bank of China had cut lending rates. The Bank of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEngland, together with the UK Treasury, had announced a plan to provide support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto finance for businesses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, competition for bank deposits remained strong, with the deposit share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof bank funding rising a little further to 53 per cent. The rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of deposits had allowed the Australian banks to continue to be selective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout accessing global wholesale funding markets. Bank paper remained well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported in secondary markets and the banks were able to access market funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas required, with reasonable levels of both secured and unsecured issuance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the month. Overall, there had been no sign of dislocation in Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial markets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFollowing the June cash rate announcement, most lenders reduced their standard variable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing rates by around 20 basis points. As a result, the average interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate on outstanding housing loans was about 60 basis points below the post-1996\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage, while rates on small and large business loans were 50 and 75 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints lower.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that financial markets were pricing in a small probability of a further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t25 basis point reduction at the present meeting, with the cash rate now expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be reduced by less over the rest of the year than had previously been anticipated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that recent data had pointed to weaker prospects for global growth:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports from east Asia (excluding China) remained flat over the past year;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pace of the recovery had slowed in the United States; and activity in Europe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have declined further in the June quarter. On a more positive note,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata for May suggested that growth in the Chinese economy was not slowing to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe extent that had been suggested by the weak data for April, and policies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been eased further. Members also noted that markets had viewed the recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannouncements by European leaders more favourably.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, members noted that the March quarter national accounts data implied\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the economy had had more momentum since mid 2011 than had previously been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated. Recent data suggested that growth had probably slowed a little from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat reported for the first quarter to be around trend pace. Mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a little stronger than had been expected, and members noted that growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin much of the non-resource economy had remained modest, particularly in those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustries under pressure from the high exchange rate and the weakness in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing sector. The measured strength of consumption growth in the March quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas at odds with a number of partial indicators for that period, but consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas being supported by a favourable labour market and recent liaison had a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirmer tone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that indications were that inflationary pressures overall remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontained, notwithstanding the evidence of somewhat stronger economic growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past few quarters. In part, this was likely to reflect the still high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of the exchange rate and a softening in global prices, in particular\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor oil and other commodities. The weak conditions in parts of the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor most of the past year – such as retailing and housing – also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have played a role.

Subsequent statements by European Central Bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(ECB) President Draghi that the ECB would do ‘whatever it takes’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto preserve the euro and that the ECB was considering direct purchases of short-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsovereign debt saw a marked decline in Spanish short-term yields in the days\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprior to the Board meeting and 10-year bond yields fell back below 7 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile Spain retained bond market access – issuing €6 billion of bonds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin July – the Spanish authorities had acknowledged that Spain could not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfund itself at current yields for an extended period. Members noted that foreign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors had markedly reduced their holdings of both Spanish and Italian sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt over the past year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEarlier in July, the deteriorating economic situation in Europe had led the ECB to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower its policy rates further. The decision to reduce the rate paid on its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeposit facility to zero meant that an increasing number of money market rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithin the euro area had become negative, which accentuated the desire to shift\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds out of the euro, thereby triggering a further depreciation of the euro.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt had also led several euro-denominated money market funds to announce their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclosure to new investments. In this context, members discussed the increasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties that pension funds in the major economies were facing in the environment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof extremely low – in some cases negative – interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA number of other central banks, including the People's Bank of China, also eased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy in July.

The decline in yields on Commonwealth Government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurities was particularly pronounced, with the 10-year yield briefly falling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a historic low just below 2.7 per cent. Offshore purchases of Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment bonds appeared to have continued apace and, in part reflecting these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurchases, the Australian dollar had appreciated over the past month, increasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough periods of both strength and weakness in ‘risk-sensitive’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets. Members noted that this had put the trade-weighted measure of the currency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback near its post-float high, notwithstanding the decline in the terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade and the weaker global outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe further decline in the euro exchange rate put additional pressure on the Swiss\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNational Bank in maintaining the franc's peg against the euro to avert\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeflationary pressures. Members noted that the Swiss National Bank had purchased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround €100 billion over May and June, with further sizeable purchases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to have occurred in July. While some of these purchases were retained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin euros, a sizeable share was converted into other currencies, including a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmodest amount in the Australian dollar. In contrast, members noted that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of Chinese foreign reserves fell in the June quarter, as capital outflows\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccurred.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare prices globally had been volatile but buoyed late in the month by the prospect\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof more forceful policy measures by the ECB. A notable exception was the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstock market, which continued its decline from earlier in the year. While banking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshares had performed poorly in European and US markets, amid investigations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the fixing of benchmark interbank rates, these declines were largely reversed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the comments by ECB President Draghi.

Domestically, the banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to focus on generating additional deposits to fund lending growth,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresulting in spreads paid on deposits relative to wholesale benchmark rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining elevated.

Uncertainty about those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures, as well as about several other upcoming decisions in Europe and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States, had contributed to low turnover in most financial markets.

Banks' bad and doubtful debt charges had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclined more substantially since the peak of the crisis period but now appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have troughed, and this had contributed – along with higher funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts and lower credit growth – to a slower rate of profit growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent reporting periods.

Most of the difference\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the year-ended rates of headline and underlying inflation was due to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe increase in tobacco excise in 2010, which was estimated to have increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe CPI by nearly 0.4 percentage points.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile food prices recorded a large increase in the December quarter, there were sizeable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice declines for a large number of manufactured goods. It appeared that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued growth in household spending was contributing to a faster-than-usual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpass-through of the exchange rate appreciation and the early 2010 tariff cuts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, the past two CPI results suggested that the weakness in retail spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad led to a little more disinflation than had earlier been expected, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year-ended underlying rate of inflation now clearly in the lower half of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe target range. However, the latest reading on consumer inflation expectations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– which was taken prior to the publication of the December quarter CPI – had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshown an increase, probably reflecting reports that the floods would have a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant effect on food prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. The medium-term outlook for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe domestic economy remained broadly unchanged from that discussed at Board\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeetings over most of 2010, although the recent floods would have a notable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on the profile of GDP in the December, March and June quarters. Growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to be lower in each of the December and March quarters, but then\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery strong in the June quarter as a recovery in coal production took place\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the rebuilding effort gathered speed. For the four quarters to the end\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2011, GDP was forecast to increase by 4¼ per cent, which was higher than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously expected because the effect of the floods had been to lower output\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the last quarter of 2010. Beyond 2011, the economy was still expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrow at an above-trend pace, much as earlier forecast, reflecting the expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong growth in mining investment and high commodity prices. Apart from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainties stemming from the floods and the possibility of additional disruptions,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers noted that other areas of uncertainty were the outlook for consumption\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the exact timing of the pick-up in resources sector investment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe near-term forecast for year-ended underlying inflation had been revised down\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little since November, reflecting the base effects of the recent outcome.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn terms of headline inflation, the floods were expected to add around ¼ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent to CPI inflation in the March quarter – mainly through higher fruit and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvegetable prices – with most of this being reversed in the following few quarters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe medium-term outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged. In underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms, year-ended inflation was forecast by the staff to be around 2½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater in 2011, before picking up gradually to 3 per cent by late 2012. Year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theadline CPI inflation was likely to remain above underlying inflation in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnext few quarters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSentiment in financial markets had generally improved over the past two months, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe notable exception of some of the smaller countries in the euro area, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns had increased about the sustainability of public finances.

Banks in parts of Europe remained under strain, however,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith their recovery undermined by weak economic growth, fiscal strains and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposures to troubled property sectors. The Australian financial system had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to perform significantly better than most others in the developed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworld, consistent with high balance-sheet quality and the relatively strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLarge banks in the major developed countries had continued to be profitable, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofit levels and returns on equity remained lower than prior to the crisis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA further reduction in provisions for bad loans had provided significant support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor profits in recent periods, offsetting a moderation in trading income from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe elevated levels seen in 2009.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, provisions and loan-loss reserves remained well above historical averages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross all major banking systems as banks continued to deal with a large amount\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof troubled property-related exposures. Funding also remained a point of vulnerability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor many banks as they sought to improve their funding structures and cope\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the need to refinance government-guaranteed debt over the next few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, profits and returns on equity had recovered to near pre-crisis levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the largest banks as bad debt expenses declined, with contributions also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming from growth in net interest income as well as insurance and funds management\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivities. Overall, non-performing asset levels – mainly reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroubled commercial property exposures – had stabilised over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear; while flooding and other recent natural disasters would reduce short-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofits in some parts of the financial sector, the overall impact was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be limited.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapital and liquidity positions of Australian banks had been bolstered further, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe banks were well placed to meet the more stringent Basel III requirements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be phased in over the next several years. One factor contributing to stronger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliquidity positions was the slower rate of credit growth, which, in combination\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith faster deposit growth, had continued to ease wholesale funding pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton banks. Reliance on short-term wholesale debt, in particular, had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom around a third of total bank funding in 2007 to around a fifth at present.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe household and business sectors in Australia did not appear to be under financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstress, though both continued to show more caution in their borrowing behaviour,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas evidenced in slower rates of credit growth over the past couple of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers saw this as a welcome development, particularly as household debt remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a historically high level and debt-servicing requirements had recently increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the rise in interest rates.

Chinese exports were also estimated to have grown strongly, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent data indicating strength in shipments to the major advanced economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas well as to elsewhere in Asia. CPI inflation was running at nearly 5 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the year to January. Until recently, the pick-up in Chinese inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been largely accounted for by higher food prices, but non-food inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad risen to 2.6 per cent, its fastest year-ended pace since 2001. The rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin inflation had occurred across a range of goods and services. The People's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of China had increased interest rates again in early February, and reserve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequirements on the banking system had also been raised again.

The exception was Japan, where private consumption fell sharply,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly as a result of the expiration of subsidies for a range of consumer goods.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe more recent data on industrial production and international trade suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat momentum in the region, including in Japan, had picked up somewhat at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe end of 2010 and in early 2011.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, business conditions had continued to strengthen.

Beyond the human cost, the earthquake\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad destroyed part of the capital stock, disrupted production and significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timpaired electricity generation in a wide area, including Tokyo. While there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere very few economic data available for Japan for March, it was clear that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity would be sharply lower in the near term, with rebuilding subsequently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to boost growth. Members were briefed on possible scenarios for electricity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply and demand in coming months, which would be an important determinant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the likely contraction in economic activity. The extent to which concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover nuclear contamination affected confidence and household spending would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe another important factor. Overall, members judged that the effects on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJapanese economy were likely to be significantly larger than those of the Kobe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearthquake in January 1995.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere would also be some effects on regional supply chains, though the effects on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal activity were likely to be relatively limited. For Australia, Japan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the second most important export destination, accounting for nearly half\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof thermal coal exports and close to one-fifth of iron ore exports. In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery short term, it was likely there would be some disruption to exports of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoods and services to Japan, though, beyond this, the rebuilding effort and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta possible increase in use of non-nuclear forms of energy could provide a boost\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Australian exports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe broader flow of information on the global economy continued to be consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith relatively strong growth and a build-up in inflationary pressures. In\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe immediate aftermath of the Japanese disaster, commodity prices had declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas uncertainty rose, though this decline had been reversed after the situation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame a little clearer. Most commodity prices were at high levels, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong demand from emerging economies. The increase in commodity prices over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past year was flowing into higher rates of inflation in many countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth remained strong in China, though there were tentative signs that it had eased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little relative to late 2010.

The most recent data showed inflation continuing to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trun at nearly 5 per cent. While strongest for food, inflation rates for a range\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof items had picked up recently. Renminbi-denominated export prices had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing since late 2009, after an extended period when they had been flat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor declining.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOutput in most other countries in east Asia was also expanding solidly, with measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof capacity utilisation, including unemployment rates, returning to around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir pre-crisis levels. With inflation rates in the region trending higher,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe authorities were gradually removing monetary stimulus. Despite this, real\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates generally remained quite low, with the authorities also relying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton macro-prudential measures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the increase in global commodity prices was posing challenges\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the advanced economies. The recent data for the United States and Europe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that a moderate recovery was continuing, though there remained a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge amount of spare capacity and unemployment rates were high. While there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas little evidence that domestically sourced inflationary pressures were building,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theadline inflation rates had risen owing to higher energy and food prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn some countries, this had led to a pick-up in measures of inflation expectations,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially over the next year. The US housing market was still weak and higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toil prices looked to be reducing consumer confidence. In contrast, the data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the US labour market showed a gradual improvement outside of the public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector and the manufacturing sector appeared to be in a solid upswing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the national accounts, GDP had increased by 0.7 per cent in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, to be 2.7 per cent higher over the year. This was in line with expectations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the time of the February meeting. The initial effects of the Queensland\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfloods on economic activity had been evident in a fall in coal production in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe December quarter.

For\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texample, growth in output in the retailing and manufacturing sectors had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively soft over the preceding year, whereas growth in a range of service\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors had been quite strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe extreme weather events across Queensland and elsewhere were complicating the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterpretation of the economic data for the March quarter. While domestic demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to be expanding at a solid pace, production in the quarter had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly affected by the natural disasters. In particular, liaison with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Queensland coal industry suggested that delays in removing water from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoal mines were leading to a slower recovery in coal production than had previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe household sector continued to exhibit restraint in spending, with the household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnet saving ratio remaining around 10 per cent in the December quarter. Retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending had recorded modest increases in the first two months of 2011, consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the staff's liaison with retailers. Consumer sentiment had declined recently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be only modestly above long-run average levels. While there was considerable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toptimism among households about prospects for the broader economy, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that consumers were less positive about their own finances. Conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the housing market remained subdued, with housing prices down slightly over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first two months of the year and auction clearance rates a little below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage. Consistent with this, growth in household credit had remained well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the average rate of recent years, and housing loan approvals had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin January and February. Residential building approvals had weakened in early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2011, with the fall concentrated in apartments, especially in Victoria, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had been very strong growth in 2010.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent business indicators showed a somewhat mixed picture.

Imports of capital goods had been trending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup and business credit had risen in February, the first increase in nine months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall borrowing conditions remained tight, though liaison with larger businesses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that there had been some improvement in the availability of finance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA strong pick-up in business investment remained the central element in the medium-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook. Members again discussed the very strong outlook for investment in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe resources sector, particularly in gas. Members noted that a major challenge\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas whether the economy could accommodate the expected high rate of investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout undue pressure on costs. Outside the resources sector, growth in investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to be relatively modest. The appreciation of the exchange rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas weighing on trade-exposed sectors such as tourism and manufacturing, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued consumer spending was affecting prospects for investment in the retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. In contrast, with office vacancy rates in the two largest cities projected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fall to quite low levels, a pick-up in commercial property construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected over the next couple of years from the current low levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth was estimated to have slowed from the rapid pace seen in the second\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thalf of 2010. The unemployment rate had, however, held steady at around 5 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent, suggesting that the reported slowing in employment could be overstated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForward-looking indicators pointed to a continuation of employment growth over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe months ahead, but at a more moderate pace than seen last year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been little new data on wages and inflation over the past month. Liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith firms suggested that wage growth was increasing in mining-related industries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand some skilled occupations, though pressures in the labour market had not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecome widespread.

Similar expectations saw the Australian dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline by more than most other currencies given the relatively large share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Japanese funds invested in Australia. On 17 March, a large upward spike\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the yen saw it rise to a historic high in nominal (though not real effective)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms. This prompted co-ordinated intervention by the G7 the following day,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first such intervention in more than 10 years. By and large, the repatriation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflows did not materialise. The yen had subsequently depreciated again and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian dollar had recovered to new post-float highs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that developments in Europe had again become the focus of market attention,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter a period when other issues had been important. The Irish Government remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin negotiations with European authorities on the terms of its support package,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile there was heightened speculation that Portugal would also need a support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpackage. There were growing signs of opposition to these packages in those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries that would be required to provide the funding.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe strong issuance in global bond markets continued in March, notwithstanding the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatility in some markets.

There had also been strong demand for corporate bond issuance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe continuation of strong deposit growth and limited asset growth had lessened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe need for bond issuance by the domestic banking sector, which had generally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjust covered maturities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA number of central banks in the Asian region had continued to tighten monetary policy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough conditions remained accommodative.

The Federal Reserve,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, was not expected by the market to begin tightening until next year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLocally, market pricing indicated that no change in policy was expected in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe near future.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that recent events in Japan had increased the uncertainty around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe near-term global outlook.

While it remained to be seen how these uncertainties\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould ultimately be resolved, the most likely outlook was that growth in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworld economy in the period ahead would be around trend pace, or a little higher,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that the price of Australia's main exports would remain at high levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some time to come.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, employment growth had slowed somewhat from the rapid rate seen in 2010,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough the outlook for the labour market remained positive.

In the short term, however, the economic data were likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be significantly affected by the earlier floods and cyclone. Headline inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas likely to be quite high in the March quarter, while GDP would be held down,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a greater extent than earlier assumed, by the lost coal production and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelays in resuming mining operations.

Growth in China and the rest of emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsia had remained strong, which was continuing to underpin high commodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rise in food and fuel prices over the past year was pushing up headline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation rates globally, prompting a gradual tightening in monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a number of economies. The IMF was still forecasting above-trend growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the global economy, albeit with significant differences between the rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof growth expected for the advanced and emerging economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt remained difficult to gauge the overall economic effects of the disasters in Japan,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough it had become clear that they would be more serious than was the case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the Kobe earthquake in 1995. While black-outs were no longer occurring,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telectricity supply would be constrained during the summer months, and it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill uncertain to what extent Japanese consumer behaviour would be affected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the nuclear power problems. The economic data that were available for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth of March showed major declines: industrial production fell by 15 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretail trade and exports both declined by 8 per cent, and survey-based measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof business conditions and consumer confidence declined sharply. There were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso reports that supply-chain problems were constraining production in other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of the world, particularly in the automobile industry.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn contrast, the pace of growth in China had remained robust. GDP grew by around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 per cent in the March quarter and most of the timely indicators of activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– including industrial production, exports and retail sales – suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the economy was continuing to grow strongly. Members discussed the further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise in Chinese inflation. Food price inflation remained elevated and there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere increasing signs that higher raw material prices were feeding through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto higher prices for a range of consumer goods. In response, the authorities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued with a range of measures to contain price increases for particular\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoods and services, including the announcement by the People's Bank of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina of further increases in interest rates and reserve requirements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemand was also growing strongly in other east Asian economies and in India. March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter GDP data for Korea, Singapore and Taiwan had been quite strong.

Consumption growth had slowed a little,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was likely in part to reflect the effect of the significant increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin gasoline prices on household budgets. Consumer confidence remained low and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe housing market was still very weak. In contrast, measures of business conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere positive. Information on the labour market was mixed: while most of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent data, including the payrolls reports, had suggested that the improvement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas continuing, initial jobless claims had increased recently.

While the depreciation of the US dollar was one factor behind\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe increases, prices had also risen significantly in terms of other currencies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely reflecting strong growth in demand, especially from the emerging economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that monetary policy remained accommodative in most countries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was adding to pressure on commodity markets. In this environment, global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation risks appeared to have moved to the upside. In some countries, higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices were also acting as a negative supply shock and reducing real\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincomes at a time when activity remained quite subdued.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main economic news over the preceding month had been the release of the CPI,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich increased by 1.6 per cent in the March quarter, with the year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate of inflation rising to 3.3 per cent. The March quarter outcome had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboosted by large price rises for a few items. There had been a 15 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in fruit and vegetable prices, a consequence of the extreme weather\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions earlier in the year. More recent data from wholesale markets suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the prices of some fruit and vegetables had already fallen back, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanana prices were expected to contribute further to inflation in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Fuel prices rose by nearly 9 per cent in the quarter, electricity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices increased by 5 per cent, and there were large seasonal increases in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe prices of health and education services. Members noted that some further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge increases in electricity prices were scheduled. Partially offsetting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rises in these various items, the appreciation of the exchange rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributed to falls in the prices of many imported retail goods. The price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindices for clothing and footwear, furniture, household appliances and audio-visual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequipment had all fallen over the year to the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe underlying measures of inflation – at 0.7–0.9 per cent in the quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– were a little higher than expected, although looking through the volatility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the quarterly numbers, the outcomes over the past six months had been in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tline with expectations last November. On a year-ended basis, underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad remained at 2¼ per cent, down from a peak of a little over 4½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2008.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been only a limited amount of data on domestic activity released since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe previous Board meeting, but this had had a slightly more positive tone\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan earlier in the year when natural disasters dominated the news. Business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions, as measured by the NAB survey, recorded a significant rise in March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto above-average levels, and business credit rose by 1 per cent in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, the strongest outcome since late 2008.

Employment was estimated to have risen solidly in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth after no net growth over the previous three months. The participation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate remained close to its record high and average hours were gradually picking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup. Forward-looking indicators continued to point to fairly solid labour demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the housing market remained subdued, with prices in most cities either\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflat or down over the past few months. Auction clearance rates in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelbourne had been at below-average levels in recent months. Members observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat growth in housing credit had slowed in recent months, while building approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand home loan approvals had also softened in 2011. While this partly reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effect of the Queensland floods, conditions had softened in most other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstates as well in the wake of the increase in housing loan interest rates in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the resources sector, liaison continued to point to a larger contraction in coal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction in the March quarter than had earlier been expected, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproblems in removing water from flooded mines. As a result, there was a high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikelihood that GDP had declined in the March quarter. In contrast, domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand was likely to have grown solidly in the quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. Notwithstanding the divergences\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween regions, the world economy was expected to grow at a modestly above-trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpace over the next few years. Australia's terms of trade were expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rise by around 10 per cent over the March and June quarters, to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore than double their average level in the 1990s, before falling back a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the forecast period as additional global supply of resources came on line.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs had been the practice over the past couple of years, the domestic forecasts were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbased on the assumption that the cash rate moved in line with expectations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplied by market pricing. The medium-term outlook for the domestic economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained similar to that discussed over the past year or so, although the growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts had been lowered a little owing to the further appreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate and its effect on trade-exposed sectors. Nonetheless, for most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the forecast period, growth was expected to be at, or above, trend, underpinned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby a boom in investment and the income boost from the very high level of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of trade. As a result, the unemployment rate was expected to continue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto decline gradually. In the short term, the quarterly profile for GDP would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe significantly affected by the floods, with a significant bounce-back in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoal production expected in the June and September quarters. Members also noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe prospect of significant fiscal consolidation over the next couple of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe moderation in inflation looked to have run its course. Given the March quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutcome, the forecast for underlying inflation over 2011 had been lifted a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle to around 3 per cent. For 2012, underlying inflation was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto remain around that level, with the gradual pass-through of the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate appreciation providing a partial offset to rising inflation pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor non-traded items. By the end of the forecast period, underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to be above 3 per cent. Headline inflation was forecast to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain above underlying inflation for the remainder of 2011, largely owing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto higher fruit and vegetable prices. It was then expected to be below underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation for much of 2012, as banana prices returned to more normal levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn terms of risks, members noted the challenges for policy-makers internationally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin dealing with the pick-up in global inflationary pressures. Sovereign debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns, both in Europe and the United States, remained an additional risk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the global economy. Domestically, one area of uncertainty was the behaviour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the household sector and whether the recent cautiousness of households would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue. Another uncertainty concerned the tightening of the labour market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand whether a pick-up in wages in the resources sector would spill over into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant pressure on wages elsewhere in the economy. Members observed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe behaviour of households and the labour market would be important determinants\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the outcome for inflation over the next few years. In addition, it would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe important that inflation expectations remained anchored and that economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicies were conducive to productivity growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConcerns about sovereign creditworthiness had come to the fore again in financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, with Portugal having sought assistance from the European Union and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe IMF. While any assistance package was likely to be similar in size and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms to those for Greece and Ireland, members noted that it could be delayed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of growing opposition to such rescue packages in other parts of Europe.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIncreased speculation about a restructuring of Greek debt late in April saw\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspreads on peripheral debt widen further to new highs. However, sovereign debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had not been affected when Standard &amp; Poor's placed the credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trating of the US Government on negative outlook, given that markets were already\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell aware of the state of the US Government's fiscal position.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the depreciation of the US dollar had accelerated in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweeks, falling to a record low on a trade-weighted basis. In part, this reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fact that US monetary policy was still being eased, with the Fed continuing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto buy US government debt, whereas monetary policy had been tightened in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of other countries. The euro appreciated to its highest level in nearly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t18 months after the European Central Bank raised its policy rate from the low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit had been at for two years. Many emerging market currencies had also risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto historically high levels against the US dollar as the authorities in those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies tightened monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures.

The inflation rate had been boosted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby a large increase in fruit and vegetable prices, and it was quite likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat GDP would be shown as having contracted in the March quarter because of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe disruption to production in the mining sector. As discussed at the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeeting, members remained of the view that it was appropriate to look through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe temporary effects on inflation and growth and to set policy based on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-term outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data confirmed above-trend growth in the world economy, which was boosting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices.

The outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor economic activity remained largely unchanged. While there were many uncertainties\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the world economic outlook, the central scenario was for a continuation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof above-trend growth.

However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumer price inflation remained elevated. Although vegetable prices had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently, higher commodity prices appeared to be feeding into second-round\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects on inflation, and non-food inflation was at its highest rate in more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan a decade.

According to the wage price index, private-sector wages grew by 3.9\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent over the year to the March quarter, which was above the average pace\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the period since 1997, although not as high as the peak rates reached\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2008.

The underlying cash balance was forecast to move from a deficit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2010/11 to a deficit of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2011/12\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a small surplus in 2012/13. This forecast consolidation reflected both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in tax revenue and a fall in expenditure as a share of GDP, resulting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom a cap on spending growth and the wind-down of fiscal stimulus programs,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas had been intended. State government budgets also pointed to some contractionary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects on the economy.

The latter appeared to face some hurdles,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, including the need to avoid any such proposal being characterised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a debt default. An uncontrolled default could be damaging for the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy, particularly if there were contagion to other countries in Europe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a significant loss of confidence in the ability of policymakers to manage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fall-out.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReflecting the concerns about Greece, the yield spread between German Bunds and sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbonds of those European countries receiving financial assistance from the EU\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand IMF – Greece, Ireland and Portugal – all reached new highs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpreads on 10-year Italian and Spanish government bonds also reached their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twidest levels in around 15 years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite these movements, there was little sign of the tensions in the wider global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney markets that had been evident in May 2010, when the Greek fiscal concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst came to the fore, or in 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that spreads in the interbank market were little changed.

Nevertheless, with global growth having been quite strong,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderlying inflation was still trending up in many countries, including the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States. In emerging economies, inflation remained uncomfortably high,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in India and China.

However, employment was flat or falling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin manufacturing and goods distribution. The strong demand for mining-related\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccupations had led to increased wages pressures in some of these areas, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese pressures remained fairly localised. Overall growth in wages was running\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the rate seen prior to the downturn, although the weak growth in measured\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproductivity meant that unit labour costs looked to be rising strongly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe household sector continued to be cautious in its spending and borrowing behaviour.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFollowing a solid rise in April, data for retail sales for May had shown a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfall, although imports of consumption goods (excluding motor vehicles) had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen strong over the past couple of months.

There had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in nominal wealth over the past year, with housing prices having softened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand equity prices lower recently. Members observed that this was in contrast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the experience of much of the past two decades. Housing credit growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teased further, to its slowest pace in many years, although housing loan approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad picked up in April and May.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe housing market remained soft, with nationwide measures of prices recording another\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall fall in May, although with some differences among cities.

Arrears rates had increased the most in Western Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Queensland, where house prices had been falling after large run-ups in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious years. Members observed that this was similar to the pattern seen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney following the rapid growth in house prices in the early 2000s: households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat entered the market around the peak in prices, when lending standards were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless stringent, had been more likely later to experience difficulties. In contrast,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe arrears rates for borrowers who purchased their home in 2009, when lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards were tighter, were not particularly high compared with earlier cohorts,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespite these borrowers experiencing a significant increase in interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince they took out their loans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe outlook for investment continued to be very strong, driven by the mining sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome companies were reporting rising costs in resource investment projects.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA number of large LNG projects were under construction or progressing through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe approvals process, and there was a high level of spending on projects to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpand production capacity for iron ore in the Pilbara. Consistent with this,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital imports had trended higher over recent months.

Members noted that the CPI outcome for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe June quarter, to be published later in the month, would be important in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelping to shape views about inflation, and therefore the future path of interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates. Accordingly, members considered that the current mildly restrictive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetting of monetary policy remained appropriate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.75 per cent.</p>"]}},

Early in July, concerns about debt in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmaller countries in the euro area spread to Italy and Spain, causing government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yields in those countries to rise to their highest levels since the inception\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the euro in 1999. Concerns also spread to Belgium and, to a lesser extent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was against this backdrop that the European Union agreed on a new rescue package\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Greece. While all the details were not yet apparent, it involved additional\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunding from the EU and the IMF, a lengthening of the maturities of the EU\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloans and a significant lowering of the interest rate, to around 3½\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent under current conditions. Members noted that similar adjustments were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be made to the rescue packages for Ireland and Portugal. It was envisaged\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat private-sector bondholders would participate in the rescue package by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trolling over or exchanging their Greek debt into bonds of longer maturities,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich would effectively translate into a ‘haircut’ for bondholders\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof around 20 per cent. While the package would mean that Greece would not need\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto access the market for new funding until 2014, its ultimate effect on Greece's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverall indebtedness remained unclear.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the reaction in financial markets to the new package initially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been favourable – with spreads on euro area sovereign debt retracing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of their earlier rise – but that this had subsequently faded.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe other major factor affecting financial markets over the past month was the difficulty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US political system had in reaching an agreement to increase the US Government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt ceiling, with agreement reached only the day before the ceiling would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave become binding. Also unsettling markets was speculation that the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates could lose its AAA credit rating.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was little movement in Treasury yields prior to the agreement being reached,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith market liquidity thin as participants awaited the outcome of the negotiations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYields fell following the agreement, though this was also in the context of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker US economic data released at the time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the largest impact of this uncertainty had been in currency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, where the US dollar had depreciated against most other currencies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treaching multi-year lows in a number of cases. This was particularly stark\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the case of the Swiss franc, which was viewed as a ‘safe haven’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the perceived economic problems in both the United States and Europe.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Swiss franc had appreciated against the US dollar by around 5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past month and 30 per cent over the past year. The Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar had also appreciated strongly and rose further following the release\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the CPI data in late July to reach multi-decade highs against the US dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand on a trade-weighted basis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal equity markets, too, had been buffeted by these developments. Bank shares\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere particularly affected, with European bank shares faring the worst. Movements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the Australian equity market were similar.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoney markets, in contrast, had experienced only relatively modest effects from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttensions in the United States and Europe. While rising over the month, spreads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton short-term market debt remained considerably lower than the levels reached\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2008. US money market funds had reduced their exposure to European banks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth by not rolling over debt issued by these banks as it became due and by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshortening the maturity of any debt that was rolled over. Australian banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefited from this development, with the US money market funds purchasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore of their debt instead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestic credit markets overall remained largely unaffected by these offshore developments.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIssuance by Australian banks remained strong over the past month, onshore as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as offshore, and their funding costs and lending rates were little changed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn reviewing changes in monetary policy settings around the world, members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the European Central Bank had increased its policy rate in July, as expected,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough the likelihood attached by market participants to further increases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been scaled back. There was no market expectation of any policy rate increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the United States and the United Kingdom in the period ahead because of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker-than-expected data. In contrast, monetary policy had been tightened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther in Brazil, China and India, as well as in some other smaller economies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket expectations about monetary policy in Australia had fluctuated in a wide range.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the European and US debt concerns had seen the market price reflect a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater probability of future easing, this was reversed following the release\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the higher-than-expected CPI for the June quarter. For this meeting, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket expected no change in the cash rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe pace of growth in the global economy had slowed in the June quarter. In the case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Asia, the slowdown appeared to reflect, at least partly, disruptions to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply chains following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. However, there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also been a broader slowdown in a number of advanced economies, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe United States. Confidence had been adversely affected by the sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt problems in Europe and the debate over the debt ceiling in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates. While the central scenario of most forecasters remained for global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth to be average, or a bit above, over the next year or so, the downside\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks had increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese economy had continued to grow strongly in the June quarter, and most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the monthly indicators suggested that growth remained firm. The main exception\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the trade data, with the volume of imports showing no growth over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnine months or so, and exports declining in May and June after earlier strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth. Inflation had continued to pick up, reaching 6.4 per cent over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear to June. While prices for food, especially pork, had contributed significantly,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-food inflation was at its highest level in a decade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, economic activity was picking up as the supply-side problems eased, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta full recovery of industrial production was not expected until after the summer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was also some pick-up evident in industrial production elsewhere in Asia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding a significant rebound in vehicle production in Thailand, where Japanese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanufacturers account for the bulk of production. In economies other than Japan,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption growth remained firm and unemployment rates were still trending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown. Year-ended core inflation rates had moved higher and monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas gradually being tightened across the region.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent US national accounts confirmed that the economy had slowed materially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2011. Growth in the June quarter had come in below expectations and growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter had been revised down significantly. The earlier data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also been revised to show a deeper recession than earlier estimated, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latest estimates showing that output had not yet returned to its pre-crisis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel. The unemployment rate had picked up recently, with growth in private-sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment weak and further falls in public-sector employment. Despite some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing in energy prices, consumption growth remained weak and members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the debate about public finances appeared to have further depressed household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence. One bright spot in the US economy, however, was that business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas continuing to pick up, supported by strong profitability. Core inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad risen in the first half of 2011, in part reflecting second-round effects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom earlier increases in commodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recovery continued in the larger euro area countries, although unemployment rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin most countries remained high. Concerns about the Greek fiscal situation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad eased a little for the time being, although members noted that Greece still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaced a very significant task in improving its competitiveness and public finances.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the downside risks to global growth, in particular those risks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstemming from the fiscal problems in the United States and Europe. It was possible\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat these could play out in a disruptive manner, leading to a marked rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin global risk aversion, as had occurred in 2008. While the financial exposures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere better understood than in the earlier episode of private-sector debt problems,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere would be less scope for monetary and fiscal policy to be eased in many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the large economies in the event of a marked slowing in global growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prices of oil, base metals and bulk commodities had tended to strengthen over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe previous month, but were still modestly below their peaks earlier in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear. Overall, Australia's terms of trade had reached their highest level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton record in the June quarter and were now expected to increase further in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe September quarter, before declining gradually as more global capacity in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiron ore and coal came on line.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main economic news over the past month had been the inflation data. In the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, the CPI had increased by 0.9 per cent, to be 3.6 per cent higher over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year. Measures of underlying inflation were running at 2½–2¾\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent over the year, which was higher than in 2010.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe year-ended headline inflation rate continued to be boosted by increases in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice of fruit, in particular banana prices, which were nearly five times their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpre-cyclone level. However, vegetable prices had fallen in the quarter as production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecovered after the floods. Petrol prices had also risen in the quarter and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe CPI measure of deposit &amp; loan facilities – which would be removed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the CPI in the September quarter – was also estimated to have risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly. Utilities prices fell slightly in the quarter, reflecting seasonal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfactors, but would increase strongly in the September quarter. There had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarger-than-expected increases in a wide range of retail goods in the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, notwithstanding the appreciation of the exchange rate and subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of consumer spending. While it was possible that this was a result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanges in the timing of discounting, it might also reflect cost pressures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming from an increase in global prices, as well as higher costs for a range\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof domestic inputs at a time when productivity growth was low.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been further evidence of cautious behaviour in the household sector. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had been no official data on retail sales since the July meeting, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstaff's liaison suggested that retail spending had been weak since mid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMay. Measures of consumer confidence had declined recently and were now below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage. Housing credit growth had slowed further and the rate of credit card\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt repayment had picked up. Housing price data suggested that nationwide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had fallen slightly over recent months, to be down by around 2 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the past year. Members noted that some of the developments in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold sector over recent years, most notably the significant increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe saving ratio from the low rates seen in the early 2000s, had reduced the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-term vulnerabilities of the economy. In addition, they observed that,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin contrast to these various signs of household caution, there had been very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong growth in overseas travel by Australians over recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey-based measures of business conditions remained around long-run average levels,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough there were very significant differences across sectors, and measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof confidence had fallen to below-average levels. While business credit had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen over the past couple of months, members observed that lending to unincorporated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses had been rising gradually since early in the year. Imports of capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand intermediate goods had been quite strong in recent months, consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta pick-up in investment in the resources sector. Members noted that the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth had seen the announcement of final investment approval for another large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLNG project. The data on coal shipments from Queensland for June had shown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta significant pick-up, although industry sources indicated that coal production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay not return to normal levels until early in 2012.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unemployment rate had held steady at 4.9 per cent in June. Employment growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad clearly slowed from the rapid pace over much of 2010 and the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate was no longer falling. The forward-looking indicators continued to point\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto moderate employment growth over the period ahead, although the staff's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliaison with businesses indicated some caution in hiring plans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the updated staff forecasts. The growth forecast for 2011\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been lowered to 3¼ per cent, 1 percentage point lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan the May forecast. This revision mostly reflected the delayed recovery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin coal production, with the remainder largely accounted for by weaker growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin consumption. With some of the recovery in coal production pushed out to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2012 and investment picking up strongly, growth was expected to be around 3¾ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin both 2012 and 2013. Mining investment was expected to increase from its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready elevated level of around 4 per cent of GDP to more than 6 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2012/13, and the terms of trade were forecast to remain very high, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown from current levels. Growth in consumption was expected to remain relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued, with some further increase in the household saving ratio expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the coming year. Members observed that significant structural adjustment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas likely over coming years given the high level of the exchange rate relative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto its average over the past decade or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn terms of inflation, the recent outcomes provided further evidence that the disinflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfluences stemming from the late 2008 slowdown had passed. However, subdued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold demand and the appreciation of the exchange rate were likely to exert\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome dampening influence on inflation in the period ahead. In preparing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts, the staff had included the estimated effects of the Government's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintention to introduce a price on carbon, which was expected to add around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0.7 percentage point to headline inflation in the second half of 2012, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta smaller effect on underlying inflation. Incorporating these effects, underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation was forecast to be 3 per cent or a little higher over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnext few years. The rate of CPI inflation was expected to be above 3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the end of the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers recognised that the effects of instability overseas could pose a downside\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisk to the domestic economy. Of the domestic risks, the main uncertainty was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe behaviour of households, as saving could increase further in an environment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof uncertainty. Members also noted the importance of productivity outcomes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor growth and inflation. Australia's productivity growth over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfive to ten years had been weak, with growth in output largely accounted for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby growth in the factors of production. Growth in incomes had been held up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the rise in the terms of trade over this period. However, with the forecasts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggesting that the terms of trade were likely to be subtracting from income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth over coming years, a significant pick-up in productivity growth would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe required to sustain real income growth around the rates seen in recent decades.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the task facing monetary policy in future would become more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult if a continuation of poor productivity growth were combined with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan expectation of growth in nominal wages and profits at the same sorts of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates seen over the past two decades.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the global economy was continuing to expand, though growth was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunbalanced between regions, and there had been some slowing in the pace of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in recent months. Significantly, the downside risks had become more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpronounced recently. There was considerable uncertainty about how persistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe current slowdown would turn out to be; when the fiscal problems in Europe\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the United States would be resolved; and what effect the ongoing market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatility would have on the global economy. At the same time, commodity prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere remaining high and this was feeding through into higher rates of global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDomestically, there were significant divergences between sectors. Activity in parts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the economy was subdued, with consumers remaining cautious and business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence having fallen somewhat. This was being mirrored in limited appetite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor debt by both households and businesses. The appreciation of the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate and the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus were also contributing to softness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin various parts of the economy. In contrast, the boom in the resources sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas benefiting some other sectors. Overall, members noted that surveys suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat business conditions, in aggregate, were around the average level of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast two decades and that the unemployment rate was at a low level.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent inflation data had been higher than expected. Year-ended CPI inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased, partly reflecting the extreme weather events earlier in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear. As these effects reversed, CPI inflation was expected to decline. Measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof underlying inflation had also picked up, and it was reasonable to conclude\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the earlier easing in underlying inflation had run its course. While recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended figures remained consistent with the 2–3 per cent target,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers believed there were grounds for concern about the medium-term outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor inflation, given the relatively limited spare capacity in the economy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe widespread increase in cost pressures, including in imported goods, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe relatively low rate of productivity improvement.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers considered whether the recent information warranted further policy tightening.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe argument for tightening further was that underlying inflation had started\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto pick up and the central projection in the staff forecasts envisaged it rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the target range during the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe case against tightening at this meeting was that the downside risks to demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad probably increased, as a result of the acute uncertainty in global financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets over the recent period. If the financial market turmoil continued,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit could further weaken household and business confidence. This in turn could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaken the outlook for demand relative to the central forecast and, over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium term, dampen the inflation outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering the current stance of policy, members noted that although interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates were only a little above average, credit growth had slowed over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths and was very subdued by historical standards. Asset prices had softened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the exchange rate was high. While various other factors were affecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese variables, taken together they suggested that financial conditions were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready exerting a reasonable degree of restraint.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving considered all these factors, members judged that it was prudent to leave\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe setting of monetary policy steady at this meeting, and to continue to assess\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe outlook for growth and inflation at future meetings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.75 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

Financial stocks had been particularly affected. Government bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields in the developed economies had fallen to new lows, with the 10-year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS Treasury yield and German Bund yield both falling below 2 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotwithstanding Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade of the sovereign credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trating of the United States to AA+.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Europe, however, doubts about the fiscal positions of European governments had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspread to Italy and Spain. This had led to significant increases in government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yields in these countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) resumed purchases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof government debt, including, for the first time, the debt of Italy and Spain.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnease about the European banking system resulted in large declines in stock prices,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with a marked widening in credit spreads. Besides the ongoing concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout exposure to ‘peripheral’ Europe, there were fears about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar funding needs of European banks, as US money market funds continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto reduce their funding of European banks. Members noted that Australian banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad benefited from the reallocation of these funds. In addition, the ECB's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar swap line with the Federal Reserve was tapped for the first time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin several months, although by only one bank and for a small amount.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs financial market concerns intensified, there were large appreciations of the Swiss\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfranc and the yen. In the first case, this represented a flight to a perceived\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafe haven, which had also seen the gold price reach new highs. In the second,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit reflected the oft-seen repatriation of funds by Japanese investors at times\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof financial turmoil. In response, the Swiss National Bank significantly boosted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe supply of Swiss francs in the domestic market – resulting in negative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshort-term interest rates – while the Japanese authorities intervened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirectly in the foreign exchange market. Despite these actions, both currencies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained around historical highs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore generally, foreign exchange market volatility was somewhat less than in other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, although still elevated. The Australian dollar traded through a large\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trange, but was more stable than equity markets; this was in contrast to 2008,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the Australian dollar tended to move <em lang=\"la\">pari passu</em> with movements in global equity prices. The Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenminbi had tended to appreciate, which was also different from earlier periods\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof financial volatility, when the authorities tended to maintain a steady peg\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the US dollar.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to monetary policy, members noted that in the United States the Federal Reserve\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad announced a commitment to keep its policy rate at zero for at least the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnext two years. In Europe, where the ECB had increased its policy rate as recently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas July, the market now expected a rate reduction by the end of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that, in Australia, market pricing <em lang=\"la\">prima facie</em> pointed to expectations of large cuts in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate by the end of the year, but a range of technical factors meant that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket pricing might not be giving an accurate reading of expectations in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent circumstances.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe decline in government bond yields globally was reflected in the local market,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the <span class=\"no-wrap\">10-year</span> yield reaching a low of 4¼ per cent in late August\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the 3-year yield declining to as low as 3½ per cent. The spreads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton state government debt widened sharply, as liquidity in that market deteriorated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(though yields still declined in absolute terms). This reflected the fact that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile there had been considerable buying of Commonwealth Government securities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby offshore investors, particularly foreign central banks, those investors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerally have a smaller appetite for state debt.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe heightened volatility in markets resulted in very low bond issuance globally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in the domestic market. In any event, the Australian banks did not need\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto issue, given strong deposit inflows both on and offshore, and slow balance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheet growth. Indeed, the strength of deposit growth and the decline in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyield curve saw a reduction in some deposit rates as well as some fixed-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe local share market also moved generally in line with its global counterparts,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut in contrast to recent months, it tended to outperform other markets. Earnings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treports released during the month were, on balance, either in line with or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin excess of analysts' expectations, although some of these expectations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been pared back in recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Stability": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCompared with the pre-crisis period, banking systems in the major countries had strengthened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir capital and funding positions over recent years. Most of them also continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto report profits in the most recent period, though overall returns on equity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained below pre-crisis averages. It remained the case, however, that many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks were still dealing with elevated levels of non-performing loans, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproperty-related loans, and their loan-loss provisioning was no longer declining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trapidly from the peaks seen during the crisis. Banks in Europe were also carrying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge exposures to sovereign debt whose creditworthiness had declined. Ongoing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak credit growth was weighing on banks' underlying revenue growth and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad dampened property markets in the major economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian banking system remained in a relatively strong condition. The recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal market turbulence contributed to falls in Australian banks' share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices and some tightening in wholesale funding conditions, but the overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect had been modest compared with the experience in most other countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in 2008. The Australian banking system was better placed to cope with periods\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof market strain than it was before the crisis, having substantially strengthened\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits liquidity, funding and capital positions in recent years. Profitability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the major banks had continued to improve to near pre-crisis levels, mainly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of declines in provisioning for bad and doubtful debts. While non-performing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets had yet to show significant signs of improvement, the ratio of non-performing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets to total assets remained well below the early 1990s peak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian insurance industry had coped well with the elevated levels of claims\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the natural disasters at the start of 2011, assisted by robust reinsurance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the financial position of the household sector in Australia. Over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past year, the household saving rate increased further and the debt-to-income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratio declined slightly. Given the recent renewed volatility in global financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, the prevailing mood of caution among households appeared unlikely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lift in the near term. While households in aggregate were managing their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt levels well, the mortgage arrears rate had drifted up over the first half\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the year, but from a low level by international standards. Moreover, this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise mainly related to loans taken out prior to 2009, when banks' lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards were weaker; newer loans were performing well despite an increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe business sector in Australia was experiencing mixed conditions: the mining and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelated sectors continued to benefit from the resources boom, while other sectors,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding retailing, continued to face headwinds from subdued consumer spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the high exchange rate. Sectoral measures of profits and business confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad therefore diverged. Having deleveraged considerably, the business sector\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad attained a stronger financial position than it was in several years ago.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemand by businesses for external funding remained weak, partly because the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness sector had been able to finance a larger share of its investment through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinternal funding in recent years, as much of that investment had been concentrated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin sectors such as mining, where profitability had increased the most.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on recent international work to strengthen the regulation of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial systems. National authorities in most countries, including Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere in the process of deciding how best to implement the Basel III bank capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand liquidity reforms. The recent focus of the international reform agenda,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thowever, had been on developing a complementary policy framework to address\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe risks posed by systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Agreement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas close to being reached on a methodology to identify banks that were systemically\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant in a global context, along with the level and form of additional\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital that these institutions would be required to hold above the Basel III\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequirements. Another aspect of this work was the development of a set of principles\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton effective resolution regimes for SIFIs, which sought to enhance the ability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof authorities to resolve distressed SIFIs without disrupting the wider financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem or exposing taxpayers to losses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent volatility in financial markets had added to the uncertainty about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal economic outlook and followed softer-than-expected June quarter GDP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutcomes in a number of economies. These developments had contributed to declines\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin measures of consumer sentiment and business conditions in August in a number\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof countries. In addition, a number of private-sector forecasters had lowered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir forecasts for global growth in 2011 and 2012. While it remained to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseen whether the financial market turbulence foreshadowed a period of significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweaker growth in the global economy, members noted that circumstances differed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom those in late 2008.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese economy had continued to grow solidly, but at a slightly slower pace\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan earlier in the year. Growth in retail sales and fixed asset investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad slowed somewhat, although investment in the interior provinces remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery strong. Exports in July had picked up further, although import growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained weak. Inflation remained uncomfortably high, rising to 6.5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to July, but the earlier upward pressure on food prices appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have eased somewhat. The authorities had taken a further step over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth to tighten policy by expanding reserve requirements to a wider range\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof deposits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElsewhere in Asia, there had been further signs that the disruptions to supply chains\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the Japanese earthquake had lessened. In Japan, GDP contracted in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe June quarter, but by a smaller amount than generally had been expected,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand production in the automotive and electronics industries continued to recover\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards pre-earthquake levels in July. June quarter GDP outcomes for other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries in the region were generally soft, although domestic demand had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto grow solidly. More timely monthly data showed strong growth in exports from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese countries. Year-ended rates of inflation had increased, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Korea, though monthly inflation rates had levelled out for some countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, the economic data for July had been a little better than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata for previous months. However, the housing market remained weak and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpayrolls data for August had been disappointing. Furthermore, the softer June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter GDP data, fiscal concerns and the turbulence in financial markets had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresulted in sharp falls in a number of the measures of consumer confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand business conditions in August. Despite ongoing weakness in the economy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pace of core inflation had been picking up gradually. Recent Congressional\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBudget Office projections showed that there would be considerable challenges\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin putting federal finances on a more sustainable medium-term path. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted also that the fiscal pressures faced by state and local governments were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresulting in significant public-sector job losses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness and consumer sentiment had also declined in Europe, although confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained well above the levels seen in late 2008. GDP growth in Europe had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen soft in the June quarter, with Germany and France recording little growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter having led the recovery over the previous year. This slowing in momentum,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif sustained, was likely to compound the fiscal challenges facing the economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof southern Europe.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prices of most exchange-traded commodities had fallen over August, though the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls were relatively small compared with those seen in late 2008 and prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained at high levels. In contrast, spot prices for iron ore and thermal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoal had risen slightly over the month, with physical demand from Asia continuing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be strong. Overall, Australia's terms of trade were expected to be at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir highest level on record in the September quarter, before gradually declining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas global production capacity in iron ore and coal increased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, while the recent economic data continued to show conditions varying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly across industries, the National Australia Bank survey for July\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that conditions in the business sector as a whole remained around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir long-run average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the high exchange rate was having a material effect on the competitiveness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a number of industries, particularly manufacturing, tourism and education.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank's liaison suggested that a growing realisation that the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate was likely to remain at a relatively high level was contributing to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tre-evaluation of business strategies. In some cases this was leading to restructuring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand even closure of facilities. However, in others it was prompting investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin new capital equipment to remain competitive, consistent with a pick-up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment intentions in the manufacturing sector reported in the ABS capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpenditure survey. More broadly, however, the capital expenditure survey suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat investment plans outside the mining sector remained subdued.

Over recent months, imports of capital goods had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly.

Nevertheless, public building activity was at quite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta high level as a share of GDP, in part reflecting construction of hospitals,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile the relatively high level of spending on public engineering projects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected activity in a range of areas, including road, rail and desalination\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplants.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsistent with developments overseas, measures of consumer confidence had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther in August, to be well below average levels. In particular, consumers'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperceptions of their personal finances were very weak, and households had become\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore concerned about the possibility of rising unemployment. The retail trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata for July had been better than for earlier months, although recent liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith retailers suggested that conditions remained soft, especially for higher-end\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretailers. However, members observed that other measures of household spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed greater strength, with overseas departures at high levels and motor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvehicle sales rebounding strongly as the availability of cars had improved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing the disruption to supplies from the Japanese earthquake.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe housing market remained weak, with nationwide measures of dwelling prices falling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain in July, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3–4 per cent</span> below their peak\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin late 2010.

Employment growth had clearly slowed from the rapid pace seen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2010, and forward-looking indicators such as job advertisements had eased.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFurthermore, liaison suggested that a rising number of firms were re-assessing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir hiring plans. Outside of industries exposed to the mining boom, firms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not experiencing significant difficulties hiring suitable workers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe wage price index increased by 3.8 per cent over the year to the June quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was a little above its average pace over the past decade and a half.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, private-sector wage growth was a little softer than expected in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter and public-sector wage growth had moderated over the past year. Nevertheless,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures of aggregate wage growth remained high relative to the slow rate of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproductivity growth, implying that unit labour costs were growing more quickly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on staff expectations for the June quarter national accounts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStrong growth in engineering investment and a bounce-back in exports were expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have contributed to strong growth in GDP in the quarter, following the weather-related\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisruptions to coal and iron ore exports in the March quarter.

The broader economy was, however, softer than earlier expected,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployment growth had slowed and confidence was lower. Cautious behaviour by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds and the high level of the exchange rate were having a noticeable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdampening effect on some sectors, while the impetus from the earlier fiscal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstimulus was abating, as had been intended. It was increasingly apparent that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy was going through a period of considerable structural change and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this was causing difficulties in a number of industries. Overall, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnear-term growth outlook looked somewhat weaker than had been expected earlier,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut the medium-term outlook still appeared positive, providing that the world\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic outlook did not continue to deteriorate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile measures of underlying inflation had, to date, remained consistent with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2–3 per cent target on a year-ended basis, they had picked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup from their lows and the Board in recent months had been concerned about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe medium-term outlook for inflation, on the basis that ongoing strength in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand would, over time, lead to a pick-up in cost pressures.

To date, more than half the EU governments, including Germany, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproved the new structure of the EFSF.

The cost of US dollar funding for all European banks had risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly, leading the major central banks to extend US dollar swap lines\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a three-month maturity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReflecting these developments, share prices of financial institutions, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose in Europe, had fallen significantly and had been extremely volatile.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt one stage, the share prices of the three largest French banks had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby more than 30 per cent in the month, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">75–90 per cent</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow their pre-crisis levels. Along with the heightened concerns about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal growth outlook, this had caused share prices globally to fall by nearly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10 per cent over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been a substantial reversal of the earlier strong capital inflows\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto emerging markets, which also drove down share prices in these economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis reversal of capital flows had been reflected in large depreciations of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerging market currencies against the US dollar.

The labour market remained weak, with little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnet job creation over recent months. Given the deterioration in the outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the economy, President Obama had proposed a fiscal stimulus equivalent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto 3 per cent of GDP, which would be offset by tightening measures spread\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the medium term.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe euro area economy had clearly slowed and little growth was expected over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe remainder of the year.

Unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the region remained at 10 per cent, though rates varied considerably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross countries. Fiscal outcomes were also diverging, with the latest IMF\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts showing a significant upward revision to the expected debt/GDP ratio\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Greece, which was now forecast to rise to around 190 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly as a result of the weaker economy.

Growth in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit remained subdued, with annualised growth of around 5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the three months to August.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data for the labour market were mixed, but on balance pointed to a softening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the labour market. After an extended period when it had remained steady\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat around 5 per cent, the unemployment rate had increased for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecond consecutive month in August, to 5.3 per cent, with the number\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof people employed estimated to have fallen in August. Notwithstanding the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick-up in the unemployment rate, the vacancy rate had risen over the three\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths to August. Furthermore, in contrast to the pick-up in the estimated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate, the number of unemployment benefit recipients had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fall. Data on employment growth by industry showed growth over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear had been strong in a range of business and household services industries,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas well as in mining, construction and public administration, while employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen in agriculture and manufacturing. Outside the resources sector,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were few reports of labour shortages and liaison suggested that the upward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure on wages was tending to ease.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the revisions to measures of underlying inflation, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta review by the ABS of the seasonality of components of the CPI. These revised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures showed recent outcomes for underlying inflation lower than those previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublished. An example was the trimmed mean measure of underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the June quarter, which was lowered from 0.9 per cent to 0.7 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbringing the year-ended rate down from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(though underlying inflation looked slightly higher in history).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ABS had also updated the expenditure weights in the CPI for the first time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin six years, with the new weights to be applied from the September quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelease. The reweighting took account of changing expenditure patterns, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumers tending to switch their expenditure towards goods and services whose\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelative prices had fallen (for example, audio, visual &amp; computing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequipment). One other significant change was the exclusion of the interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmargin measure in the ‘deposit &amp; loan facilities’ category,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been a source of volatility in inflation outcomes over recent years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf the new weights and seasonal factors had been in operation over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, the outcomes for inflation would have been lower than those published\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier. In particular, the staff estimated that underlying inflation over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year to the June quarter would have been 2¼–2½ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent, rather than 2½ –2¾ per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the implications of recent developments for the economic outlook.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBased on economic and financial developments over the preceding two months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was likely that growth over the forecast period would be somewhat slower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that the labour market would be less tight than forecast at the time of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>. This prospect, as well as the lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarting point for inflation, meant that the inflation outlook appeared less\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerning than was the case a few months ago. The inflation outlook would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe reviewed after receipt of the next round of data on prices ahead of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in global financial markets had continued to be very unsettled, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty increasing about both the prospects for resolution of the sovereign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt and banking problems in Europe and the outlook for global economic growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis had been reflected in falls in measures of consumer and business confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the major economies, and it was likely to weigh on spending and growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese economies. This could spread to other regions, but so far indications\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere that economic activity was continuing to expand in China and other parts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Asia. Overall, recent events had led forecasters to reduce their estimates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor global GDP growth.

In other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors, cautious behaviour by households and the earlier rise in the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate were having a noticeable dampening effect. The impetus from earlier Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment spending programs was also abating, as had been intended. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere remained good reasons to expect solid growth over the medium term, indications\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere that the pace of near-term growth was unlikely to be as strong as earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected, reflecting both local and global factors, including the financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturmoil and associated effects on business confidence. With labour market conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow a little softer, the likelihood of a significant acceleration in aggregate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour costs was lessening. These developments, together with new data showing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the pick-up in underlying inflation had been more gradual than initially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated, suggested that the medium-term inflation outlook may now be more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> target.

Members noted that financial conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad already eased somewhat, with interest rates for some housing and business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloans declining slightly because of increased competition and the fall in funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts in financial markets.

Over the forecast period, domestic demand was expected to grow\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat an annual rate of around 4 per cent, with growth in imports substantially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaster than this, owing to both the high exchange rate and the mining sector's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively greater use of imported capital goods.

CPI inflation had remained above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3 per cent on a year-ended basis, but was expected to decline significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the next few quarters, as prices fell for some key food products that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been affected by adverse weather earlier in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInformation on economic activity suggested that the pace of growth in demand and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutput outside the resources and related sectors was a little lower than had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen expected earlier in the year. The revised staff forecasts pointed to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikelihood of overall GDP growth being close to trend over the next one to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo years, and inflation being consistent with the 2–3 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial conditions had already been easing somewhat, with a range of lending rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tedging down over the past couple of months.

A case could be made for leaving\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates unchanged on the basis that, unless the world economy turned down in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta serious way, the expansionary effects of the high terms of trade and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassociated investment build-up would, in time, assert themselves more fully,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven though recent conditions had been softer than expected.

Over the same time, aggregate business profitability had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen – particularly in the mining sector – and business failure rates had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased somewhat under the influence of a high exchange rate and a return\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto more traditional saving and borrowing behaviour by households over recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears.

While the risks to the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook appeared to be more balanced than they had been in the preceding year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent events had highlighted the fact that important vulnerabilities remained,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in Europe.

New borrowing for housing had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpicked up, while forward-looking indicators and the Bank's business liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested that demand for new housing was improving – notwithstanding a decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin building approvals in the March quarter – with enquiries from prospective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurchasers and visits to display homes increasing. New dwelling investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased since the middle of the previous year, with members observing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat approvals for higher-density dwellings had increased, while approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor detached dwellings had been flat over this period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that survey-based measures of conditions in the business sector remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow average, although some measures of business confidence had picked up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little in recent months. Indicators of business investment in the near term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained soft: capital imports had declined in recent months, office vacancy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates had risen and indicators of capacity utilisation were below long-run\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage levels. Liaison continued to suggest that firms remained cautious about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundertaking significant expansion.

The forecasts continued to incorporate the effect of both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal consolidation and the high level of the Australian dollar, as well as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe approaching peak in mining investment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the nature of mining investment was changing. There had been some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpull-back in coal investment plans in the previous year and a significant amount\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof investment in iron ore projects had been completed. In contrast, a larger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare of ongoing mining investment related to LNG projects, which were based\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton long-term supply contracts. This characteristic implied less uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout mining investment arising from volatility in commodity prices over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnext couple of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe effects of stimulatory monetary policy were continuing to emerge. Improved conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the housing market and strong population growth were also expected to support\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelling investment and household spending more generally. While growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness investment outside the mining sector looked to have been a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsofter than expected in the first half of 2013, it was forecast to pick up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a moderate pace over the remainder of this year and into 2014. This was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistent with the most recent ABS survey of firms' capital expenditure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the labour market were expected to remain somewhat subdued in the near\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm, with growth of employment projected to be below that of the working-age\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpopulation over coming quarters. Employment growth was then forecast to pick\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup as output growth gradually improved. Consistent with the forecast for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market over the next year or so, wage growth was expected to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderate over the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the near term, the outlook was for inflation on a year-ended basis to be a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower than had been published in the February Statement on Monetary Policy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely reflecting lower-than-expected inflation in the March quarter. At a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarterly pace, underlying inflation was expected to be close to the middle\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the target over the course of the next two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of developments in financial markets over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month with the announcement by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) of a range of policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures that sought to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe new policy measures included a shift in the BoJ's operational target\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom an overnight interest rate to a measure of the money base, and were more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpansionary than had been anticipated by markets. Overall, the measures were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to double the BoJ's holdings of Japanese government bonds over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe coming two years and thereby boost the size of its balance sheet to nearly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t60 per cent of GDP. Members noted that, while the absolute size of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese purchases was smaller than the US Federal Reserve's comparable program,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would be much larger relative to the size of the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJapanese bond yields had fallen sharply immediately following the BoJ's announcement,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the 10‑year yield falling to a record intraday low of 32 basis points,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore quickly rising in highly volatile conditions. These movements reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors' uncertainty about whether the measures would eventually lead\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto inflation of 2 per cent, and members noted that success in this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregard would be likely to result in Japanese bond yields rising significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat some point. Members noted that developments in wages in Japan over the next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear or two would be a key indicator of the success or otherwise of this policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the initial market commentary around the BoJ's announcement,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had suggested this policy action would prompt Japanese investors to allocate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore of their funds to offshore securities. Members discussed the likely incentives\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the various holders of Japanese government bonds to invest offshore. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that, to date, there had been little evidence of Japanese investors increasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir offshore holdings. If anything, the evidence was to the contrary, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflows back into Japan since late 2012, as domestic investors sought to realise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaluation gains arising from the large decline in the yen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApart from the yen, exchange rates generally had been little changed, with the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar remaining high by historical standards despite depreciating a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst most currencies. The Chinese renminbi (RMB) had appreciated over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month, and members noted that the Australian dollar had recently become\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fifth currency to be approved for direct trading against the RMB in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese onshore market, with trading having commenced on 10 April.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent depreciation in the yen had also contributed to a further sharp rise in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJapanese share prices, which were now more than 60 per cent above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir trough the previous year. Elsewhere, equity prices had generally been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta little higher over the past month, with China the main exception as softer-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChinese economic data contributed to further declines in equity markets. Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare prices had increased, as gains in the financial sector, following strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearnings reports by Australian banks, had more than offset a decline in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresources sector associated with lower commodity prices. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare prices of Australian banks had gained around 30 per cent since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2012.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment bond yields had again approached their historic lows in Germany and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States during April. The declines in yields on Spanish and Italian government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt had been particularly noticeable, with 10-year yields currently around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4 per cent. This in part reflected speculation about increased demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Japanese investors, although there had been little evidence to suggest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch demand had emerged yet.

This was expected to be partly offset by growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof resources exports, a pick-up in consumption and moderate growth in dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith inflation contained and domestic economic activity forecast to be below trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the period ahead, the Board had maintained the cash rate at a level consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith borrowing rates being close to previous lows. Increasingly, the household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector had shown signs of responding to these low rates: wealth had been bolstered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby higher equity and dwelling prices; measures of consumer confidence were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove average; housing and personal loan approvals had been rising, although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcredit growth remained subdued to date; and dwelling construction activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas growing. At the same time, however, conditions in the business sector,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas assessed in surveys, generally had remained below average, possibly in part\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause the exchange rate had remained high despite lower export prices and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor some months the Board had considered that the inflation outlook provided scope\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto ease monetary policy further, should that be necessary to support demand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers recognised that the effects of the earlier reductions in interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still working through the economy.

With the March quarter national accounts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscheduled for release the day after the Board meeting, members were briefed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the indicators that were available at the time of the meeting. These suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat economic activity had grown at close to, or a little below, trend pace\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter, consistent with growth over the year being a bit below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrend.

The fall in capital imports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the beginning of the year was consistent with a decline in investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the first quarter, although recent data showed that capital imports had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbounced back somewhat in April.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the ABS survey of firms' capital expenditure plans, non-mining investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to show moderate growth over the next year or so. While the survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso continued to imply further growth in mining investment, in the past actual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannual capital expenditure by mining companies had often differed by a wide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmargin from their forecasts as reflected in the ABS survey. Based on public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatements by mining companies and information from the Bank's liaison,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit seemed likely that mining investment was near its peak but would probably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain at a high level for the next year or so. However, members observed that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was considerable uncertainty about mining investment beyond that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn particular, changes in production and exports of energy commodities in other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries were making it more difficult to assess the potential for new projects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the gas sector in Australia.

In the March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, growth of retail sales volumes was strong across most categories,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamid a decline in retail prices. Liaison suggested that the pace of retail\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending might have eased somewhat more recently, while measures of consumer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence fell back to around average levels in May.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the effects of low interest rates had been evident in a range\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof housing market indicators. Building approvals for both higher-density and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdetached dwellings had increased over recent months. The Bank's liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontacts were generally becoming more positive about the outlook for dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment. Also, loan approvals had grown more strongly in recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding for new housing, and auction clearance rates were well above average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney and had picked up to be a bit above average in Melbourne.

The monthly employment data continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be volatile, with a large increase in employment in April following a sizeable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecrease in March. Looking through this volatility, employment growth had not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen as fast as growth of the labour force, which had led to the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate drifting higher over the past year, to 5½ per cent. Job advertisements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad stabilised earlier in the year, but had edged down in recent months.

The net result had been a marked increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin volatility and higher bond yields in Japan. Members noted that, while Japanese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestors had shifted out of bonds and into equities, there had been little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence to date of a shift into foreign bonds. Nonetheless, if it occurred,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch a shift had the potential to affect Australian foreign exchange and debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets. Despite Japanese investors allocating a relatively small share of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir holdings of foreign debt securities to Australia, the absolute value\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this allocation was large relative to the size of both Australian debt markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand capital inflows.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the United States, 10-year Treasury yields had risen by around 50 basis points\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring May, mainly reflecting the uncertainty about a possible turning point\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US monetary policy cycle. In this context, members discussed the possibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof further substantial increases in yields on US Treasuries, and noted the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease that had occurred in 1994, which was associated with the Federal Reserve's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttightening of monetary policy during that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that a number of other central banks had reduced their policy rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring May, including the European Central Bank, which had lowered its policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate to 50 basis points. Members also observed that spreads in peripheral\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEuropean markets had fallen to their lowest level in two to three years, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPortugal had been able to issue its first new bond since early 2011.

Equity markets elsewhere had generally showed small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgains over the past month. However, the Australian equity market had declined,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith share prices for some companies falling in response to profit warnings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare prices of Australian banks had retraced the significant increases recorded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier in the month, which had followed their positive earnings reports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had appreciated further against most currencies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month, with the Chinese renminbi a notable exception. The appreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the US dollar had mostly reflected changing expectations about US monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy. In that regard, an important contributor to the recent depreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Australian dollar had been the US dollar's appreciation. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted, however, that the Australian dollar had depreciated against most currencies,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting further declines in commodity prices and market concerns about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlook for China, as well as the reduction in the cash rate in May. Over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month, the exchange rate had depreciated by around 5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin trade-weighted terms and it was around 8 per cent below the historical\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh reached in early April.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFollowing the Board's decision in May to reduce the cash rate target by 25 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints, most lenders in Australia had subsequently lowered their standard variable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing rates in line with the reduction in the cash rate. This resulted in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending rates for most households and businesses reaching or approaching historic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlows.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that current market pricing in Australia indicated little expectation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a change in the cash rate at the June meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tData on global economic activity released over the past month had been broadly consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith earlier forecasts of around average growth in Australia's major trading\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartners this year, with growth picking up gradually thereafter.

Following its policy meeting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin June, the Federal Reserve had reiterated that it would not consider raising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe federal funds rate as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand inflation expectations were well behaved. However, the Fed had added that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif its forecast for the economy came to pass, it would expect to begin scaling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback its rate of bond purchases later this year, and to end bond purchases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompletely in mid 2014. While there was little new in this statement, financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets subsequently brought forward their expectation of the first increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the federal funds rate to early 2015 from the end of that year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReflecting this assessment, US 10-year bond yields had risen by 40 basis points,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing a 50 basis point rise in May. Volatility in fixed income markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also increased, which had added further to the rise in yields by reducing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe willingness to take risk. While the reaction to the Fed's statement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay have been disproportionate to its news content, members observed that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of US 10-year yields, at 2½ per cent, was still low\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby historical standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe shift in expectations about US monetary policy had affected most markets. Notably,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmortgage rates in the United States (pricing of which tended to be linked to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger-term yields) had risen further, along with bond yields in all major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets apart from Japan, where the market had been relatively settled after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe volatility in the previous month. Spreads between euro area periphery bonds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand German Bunds had widened, with Spanish and Italian yields rising to around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5 per cent for a time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian 10-year bond yield had moved broadly in line with US yields and rose\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto more than 4 per cent at one point during June, the highest level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin more than a year. Spreads on state government debt remained narrow, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas somewhat unusual given the heightened volatility in bond yields. The volatility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin fixed income markets had been associated with limited issuance both globally\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand locally, including minimal new issuance by Australian banks over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that riskier asset markets, which had been the recipient of large capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflows resulting from the accommodative monetary policy settings in the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies, had been most affected by the shift in expectations about US monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy. Currencies and share markets of emerging market economies had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply, while sovereign bond yields in those countries had increased to their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighest levels in around a year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother factor contributing to the volatility in financial markets was a tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof short-term liquidity conditions in China. It appeared that the People's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of China was comfortable with some tightening in the interbank market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto help rein in the pace of credit growth, particularly in the ‘shadow’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanking system where growth had been strong in the first half of 2013.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rise in global bond yields had been mostly associated with weaker equity prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the major economies, although the decline in the US equity market had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless than had occurred elsewhere. Japanese equity prices had fallen particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply and reversed most of the gains since the Bank of Japan had introduced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits new policy measures in early April. Chinese equity prices also experienced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge declines, reflecting the tightening in financial conditions there, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian equity prices had reversed almost all of the previous gains over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year to date, with the biggest falls occurring in resources stocks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the US developments had led to a small decline in the US dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton a trade-weighted basis, notwithstanding an increase in terms of most emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket currencies and relative stability against the euro.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese global developments had also seen a further depreciation in the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar was around 12 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow the high reached in early April and close to its lowest level since September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2010. Overall, domestic financial markets viewed the lower exchange rate as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treducing the need for monetary policy to be eased further, with the market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the time of the meeting attaching a 25 per cent probability of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta decline in the cash rate occurring in July, with only a single reduction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected by the end of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that the data released over the past month were consistent with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth of Australia's major trading partners remaining around average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMonthly indicators of economic activity continued to point to steady growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Chinese economy, with stable growth in investment and ongoing demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor new housing. It remained too early to tell how long the tightening in financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in China would be sustained and what its effect on borrowing and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic activity might be.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recovery in the United States appeared to be continuing at a moderate pace, notwithstanding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome signs that fiscal consolidation was weighing on private demand. The pace\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof growth in household consumption had slowed a little in recent months and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production had been somewhat subdued. Against this, however, a wide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trange of indicators pointed to further improvement in the housing sector and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttotal employment continued to grow at around the same pace as the average of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past year or so.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, economic activity had strengthened a little further in recent months but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfew details had been provided on the anticipated structural reforms. In the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest of east Asia, after softer-than-expected growth in the March quarter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata available for April and May pointed to improved growth in the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe euro area economy remained weak, with GDP across much of the region likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave declined again in the June quarter, although activity appeared to be more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresilient in Germany than elsewhere.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMeasured in foreign currency terms, most global commodity prices had declined in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months. Spot prices for bulk commodities had declined further, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices for base metals and oil had also fallen to around their mid-2012 levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed, however, that, in Australian dollar terms, Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity export prices had changed little over recent months because of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent exchange rate depreciation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe national accounts for the March quarter were released the day after the June\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard meeting and confirmed the Bank's expectation that GDP had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto grow at a pace a bit below trend in recent quarters. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumption was weaker than had been implied by the relatively strong pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin retail sales in the March quarter, while business investment declined and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelling investment was flat. Exports increased further in the quarter, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresources, while imports fell sharply in line with the decline in mining investment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore timely indicators of economic activity had been broadly consistent with growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining below trend. Retail sales were flat in April, though the Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliaison contacts suggested that sales rose modestly in May and June. Measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof consumer sentiment were close to long-run averages, although consumers'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns about unemployment had been high and increased in June.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that conditions in the housing sector continued to improve gradually.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, dwelling investment was flat in the March quarter as continued growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin investment in new dwellings was offset by lower spending on alterations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand additions. Forward-looking indicators for new construction continued to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe favourable, with the number of building approvals increasing strongly in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApril and loan approvals rising noticeably over recent months, including for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew dwellings. Dwelling prices increased over the June quarter and auction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclearance rates remained high by historical standards. This was consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the Bank's liaison with builders, which suggested that housing conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad improved further in most states.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey-based measures of business conditions improved in May, but were still a little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow long-run average levels. Over the past few months, measures of sentiment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad improved for some industries, including construction and business services,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand declined slightly for other industries, most notably mining and manufacturing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the volume of resources exports had risen further, and was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to grow with the addition of new capacity for bulk commodities, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in commodity prices over the past year or so had weighed on the resources\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector. Members noted that while mining investment remained at a high level,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplanning and development work related to future projects had declined significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the previous year. Even so, given the considerable volume of firmly committed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork, mining investment was likely to remain high for some quarters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed that the Bank's liaison suggested that the near-term outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor non-mining business investment remained modest, in line with a range of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother indicators and survey measures. At the same time, however, the depreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the exchange rate over the past two months was expected to provide more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupportive conditions for the tradable sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market conditions remained somewhat subdued. While changes in employment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen volatile from month to month, year-ended growth, at a little over 1 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to be below population growth. Overall, unemployment had been on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta gradual upward trend over the past year or so, even though the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate ticked down to 5.5 per cent in May. Average hours worked declined\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther in May and were at a two-year low. Over the past few months, employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had been strongest in New South Wales and South Australia. Employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been flat to declining in Queensland and Western Australia, consistent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a decline in demand associated with mining-related activity in those states.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForward-looking indicators of labour demand implied only modest growth in employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the months ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been little new data on prices or wages during the month.

At some time beyond that, however, mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was expected to decline more rapidly, partly reflecting a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in the planning and development work that is a precondition for new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects.

The increase in payrolls\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been a bit lower over recent months than earlier in the year. In addition,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile house prices had risen further, housing starts and mortgage applications\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor purchases had declined since earlier in the year. The government shutdown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas expected to reduce growth only slightly in the December quarter.

Nationally,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelling prices were above their late 2010 peak, with prices over the three\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths to October increasing significantly in Sydney. Housing turnover and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloan approvals had picked up noticeably. Improved conditions in the established\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing market were providing an impetus to dwelling investment, with residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals increasing over the year. Approvals increased notably in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember, driven by a pick-up in high-density approvals, which tend to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquite volatile from one month to the next. In discussion, members observed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat developments in the established housing market and the increase in new\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwelling activity seen to date were among the expected effects of the low level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvey-based measures of business confidence, and some timely measures of business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions, had increased markedly over the past two months.

Indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof current conditions in the non-mining sector remained mixed. Non-residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilding approvals were above levels of a year earlier. However, members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat office vacancy rates had risen to relatively high levels and that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in government employment was likely to weigh on demand for office space\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some markets. While investment in the mining industry had declined, resources\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports, particularly of iron ore, had been growing strongly as more projects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere completed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market conditions remained soft. There had been little growth in employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince earlier in the year, although the unemployment rate had been relatively\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstable over recent months with the participation rate declining. At the same\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, the trend in total hours worked remained quite positive and there were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent signs that a number of forward-looking indicators of employment growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere no longer declining.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCPI inflation picked up in the September quarter, to 1.0 per cent in seasonally adjusted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms, although the year-ended rate declined slightly to 2.2 per cent as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinitial effect of the introduction of the carbon price in the September quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2012 was no longer in the year-ended rate. The various measures of underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation were between ½ and ¾ per cent in the quarter, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a touch higher than had been expected, and a little above 2¼ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent over the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) rose in the quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA pick-up in tradable food prices accounted for much of the increase while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices of consumer durables declined further, although at a slower pace than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent quarters. Overall, based on historical experience, it was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the effect of the exchange rate depreciation earlier in the year was yet\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be seen in most tradable consumer prices. Non-tradables inflation had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively stable in recent quarters at a rate a little below its average over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past decade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board discussed staff forecasts for the domestic economy, which had been revised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting several influences. The exchange rate had appreciated somewhat over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past three months and the fall in mining investment was expected to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarger than previously expected. Public demand was also expected to be quite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak. Working in the other direction, there had been an improvement in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket conditions and a pick-up in measures of business and consumer confidence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth was expected to remain below trend, at close to 2½ per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the next year.

The forecast was for employment growth to be below population growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the near term and for the unemployment rate to continue to increase gradually\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the next year or so, before beginning to decline later in the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod as non-resources activity picked up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStaff forecasts for inflation were little changed, with small influences from a slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher-than-expected outcome for the September quarter, softer conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe labour market and a higher exchange rate. The subdued outlook for the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket implied that domestically generated inflationary pressures were likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto remain contained. Despite the recent appreciation, the exchange rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciated in net terms since earlier in the year, with the result that rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timport prices were expected to exert an upward influence on tradables prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin coming quarters (but by less than was expected three months earlier when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe exchange rate was lower still). In year-ended terms, the central forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas for underlying inflation to remain consistent with the inflation target\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the forecast period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers commenced their discussion of financial markets with a focus on the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates. While uncertainty about raising the debt ceiling had attracted considerable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattention during October, members noted that the impact on financial markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas primarily confined to the short-term money market in the United States.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYields on short-term US government debt rose by up to 50 basis points as investors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere concerned that payment on these securities would be delayed. In the event,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese effects were largely reversed after Congress passed last-minute legislation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto continue to fund spending and suspend the debt ceiling, but only until early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2014.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that, in contrast, longer-term yields and equity prices in the major\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial markets had been relatively unaffected. Prices in major equity markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell modestly in the lead-up to the US debt ceiling being reached, but subsequently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trallied on the markets' assessment that events had reduced the likelihood\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Federal Reserve scaling back its asset-purchase program this year. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectation was further strengthened by weaker-than-expected US employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata for September, with the US equity market rising to a record high subsequently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the Australian equity market had also increased, to its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighest level in five years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe changed expectations about the path of US monetary policy during October also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther eased pressures in the emerging market economies, with a continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunwinding of the sharp rise in bond yields that had occurred between late May\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand August.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe currencies of Brazil, India and other emerging economies had appreciated from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir recent low points, while foreign exchange markets generally were more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued through October. Volatility in foreign exchange markets declined further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the course of the month, despite the uncertainty over the US fiscal position.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs expectations of the timing of asset purchase ‘tapering’ by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFederal Reserve were gradually pushed back, the US dollar tended to depreciate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst other major currencies and on a trade-weighted basis, although this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmove was largely reversed later in October. The Australian dollar was little\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged in trade-weighted terms over the month. Members noted that the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate was around 5 per cent higher than its trough in early August\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 10 per cent below its peak in April.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers devoted time to review data on capital flows to and from Australia. They\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that net capital flows into Australia over the past couple of decades\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t– which were the counterpart to the current account deficits –\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad mostly been inflows into private sector assets, but the composition of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese flows had changed quite substantially over the past five years. In contrast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto past patterns, most of the private capital flows into Australia since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonset of the global financial crisis had been to the non-financial sector,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than the financial sector (mainly banks), with much of that representing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflows into the resources sector, which had funded the recent high level of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment in that sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were briefed on the most recent ABS survey of foreign currency hedging practices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby Australian entities, which was released in late October, and noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe results were similar to those reported in previous surveys. In particular,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian entities continued to have more foreign liabilities than assets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut most of these liabilities were denominated in Australian dollars and much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the remainder was hedged, which meant that Australian entities as a whole\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad a positive net foreign currency asset position. A further breakdown of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectoral foreign currency exposures indicated that, after hedging, Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks had minimal unhedged foreign currency positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBond issuance by Australian banks totalled $4 billion in October but, after accounting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor maturing bonds and buybacks of government-guaranteed bonds, net bank bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuance had actually been negative in the month, which continued the decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the stock of bonds that had commenced in March this year. This outcome reflected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth the restructuring of bank balance sheets in favour of deposit funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas well as only moderate demand for credit. On the other hand, Australian non-financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporations had recorded solid issuance of corporate debt in 2013 and there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad also been higher issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers concluded their discussion of financial markets with the observation that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket interest rates currently implied that no change was expected in monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy at this meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent data had been consistent with growth of Australia's major trading partners\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining around its long-term average.

In time, non-resources business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was also expected to increase given the low level of interest rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand recent substantial increases in measures of business confidence and conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that while the timing of investment upturns was very difficult\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto predict, it appeared likely that growth of the economy over the coming year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be below trend but that growth could reasonably be expected to pick up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthereafter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt recent meetings, the Board had judged that it was appropriate to leave the cash\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate unchanged while continuing to gauge the effects, including in the housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket, of the substantial degree of monetary policy stimulus that had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tput in place over the past two years. There was mounting evidence that monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy was supporting activity in interest-sensitive sectors and asset values,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand given the lags with which monetary policy operates, the stimulatory effects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould likely continue coming through for some time.

Adjusting real household disposable income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor interest payments lowered the year-ended growth rate only slightly, despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher debt levels and rises in interest rates over that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse prices increased further towards the end of 2007, with 3 per cent growth nationwide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the December quarter taking the increase for the year to 12 per cent.

Mining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment was the fastest-growing sector. With investment having reached a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level measured as a share of GDP, substantial additions to the capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstock were in prospect, which would in time help to boost the economy's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproductive potential.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis strong investment had driven up demand for funds by the business sector.

Part of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rapid pace of growth was, however, the result of a greater reliance on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintermediated finance on the part of borrowers who were having difficulty accessing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds directly in capital markets following the credit crisis. Household credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was around 12 per cent over 2007, which was at the lower end of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trange in the past decade. There were signs that the household sector was slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits demand for finance in the face of higher interest rates.

Wheat prices, in particular, had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery rapidly in the second half of 2007. As a consequence of the decline in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbase metals prices, the terms of trade had fallen somewhat in recent quarters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that, with rises in new contract prices for coal and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiron ore expected to be significant, the terms of trade were forecast to rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain in the first half of 2008.

Despite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tight conditions in the labour market, the wage price index (WPI) had maintained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta steady growth rate of around 4 per cent per annum. Another measure –\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage earnings per employee from the national accounts – suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there had been a noticeable pick-up in wage growth, though this indicator\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas subject to significant volatility.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe outlook for GDP and inflation prepared for the meeting incorporated a slowdown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin non-farm GDP growth to 2¾ per cent by the end of 2008, with growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising to 3 per cent during the following year. GDP growth was expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe a little higher than that, reflecting the improved conditions assumed for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe farm sector during 2008. The staff forecast for underlying inflation, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe absence of any monetary policy tightening, was for it to rise to around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3¾ per cent early in 2008 before gradually declining in response to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forecast slowing in both the world economy and Australia. It was still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to be above 3 per cent by mid 2010. Year-ended CPI inflation was forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rise more sharply in the March quarter 2008, to around 4 per cent, owing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the passing out of the very low figure recorded a year earlier. After that,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear-ended CPI inflation was expected to settle broadly into the same trajectory\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas underlying inflation.

The yen had appreciated and the euro\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad reached multi-year highs against the US dollar. However, the US dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad appreciated against some other currencies over the past two months, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplied that the effective exchange rate was little changed, albeit around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thistorical lows. The pace of appreciation of the renminbi had increased significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the final quarter of 2007, which was part of the policy response by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPeople's Bank to restrain inflation in China.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had also traded in a relatively wide range in the recent period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand closely tracked the changing sentiment in global financial markets. Average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintraday volatility in January had been the highest in over a decade. Measured\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the trade-weighted index, the Australian dollar was 2 per cent higher over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past two months and around 9 per cent higher over the past year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian share market had fallen since the start of 2008, following a strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperformance in 2007. At one time it had been as much as 24 per cent below the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent domestic peak, but strong rises recently had almost halved the losses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIntraday volatility had been particularly high in the past month; large price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovements in both directions had prompted a noticeable increase in margin calls,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough leverage had been steady. Share price indices for the commercial banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia had declined by a smaller amount than their peers in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates since early 2007, but the falls in share prices of Australian investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks had been of similar magnitudes to those of US investment banks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at developments in capital markets, members observed that corporate and asset-backed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond issuance remained extremely low in recent months. However, banks had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto raise funds by issuing bonds both offshore and onshore. The cost of raising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds in capital markets had increased significantly compared with costs prevailing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup to mid 2007. This had lifted banks' overall cost of funds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, while banks' costs had risen, they had been able to continue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto expand their balance sheets. The major banks had stepped up their lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto offset reduced lending by intemediaries relying on securitisation for funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand by international investment banks. To date, they had been able to accommodate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe increased loan demand by corporates that were facing limited access to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital markets. Members discussed the possibility that funding and capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstraints on banks might, at some point, result in their restricting lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increases in funding costs led banks to increase margins on business loans in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember and housing loans in January. Business lending rates had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rise during the past month or so in response to increases in bank bill yields.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that, following release of the December quarter CPI, pricing in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney market had attached a high probability to a monetary policy tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat this meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recommendation to the Board was for an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints to 7 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn debating this recommendation, members agreed that a key issue was that inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased, and was running at a higher pace than had been expected prior\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the release of the December quarter CPI. On a year-ended basis, CPI inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould rise further in the March quarter. Members took note of the staff forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat inflation was likely to moderate somewhat during 2009 but that, in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsence of policy action, it was still likely to exceed the top of the target\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby mid 2010. In addition, indicators of demand had remained strong through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe second half of 2007, capacity utilisation remained high and shortages of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuitable labour persisted. Recent trends in world commodity markets suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Australia's terms of trade were likely to rise further, providing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan additional boost to incomes in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were strongly of the view that a significant slowing in demand from the pace\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved through 2007 would be required for inflation to return to the target.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo important factors would work in that direction: significantly weaker global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and the effect of rises in borrowing costs that had already occurred.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe global situation was still evolving, and it was too soon to see the full\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects of previous increases in interest rates, though household borrowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad slowed to some extent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile noting the uncertainties surrounding forecasts, members judged that, on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis of currently available information, the main risk was that demand would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill prove to be too strong to allow a decline in inflation over a reasonable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime period. Indicators of inflation expectations were also tending to rise,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich could increase the cost of reducing inflation over time. They therefore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcluded that the outlook for inflation required an immediate response from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy. The debate focused on whether the change in the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be 25 or 50 basis points.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe discussion noted that a good case could be made for the larger move, on the grounds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the inflation outlook had deteriorated and the risk of inflation expectations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecoming dislodged had increased. Thus there was a case for the Board to send\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta stronger signal of its intention to act as necessary to reduce inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFurther, on some measures, the level of the cash rate in real terms arguably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas noticeably below what might be expected given the economy's circumstances.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn this basis, a significant further rise in the cash rate could be necessary.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that an argument in favour of a rise of only 25 basis points was that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe level of rates faced by borrowers had already risen somewhat over the summer,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindependently of policy action. A rise of 25 basis points now would produce\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta total rise over nine months of about 100 basis points for business borrowers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand around 90 basis points for housing borrowers. This was a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease over such a period and much of the effect of it was still to be seen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdditional tightening could be implemented at the March and/or subsequent meetings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas judged necessary. Reinforcing this, global credit and equity markets, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Board considered carefully, had also been unsettled over recent weeks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the working out of the financial difficulties of the major international\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial institutions had some way to run. To date, the effects of this on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia had been confined to a significant slowing in the pace at which non-bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorporates and intermediaries could raise funds directly, with the major banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlargely making up the difference. But some wider dampening effects could occur\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the period ahead, which were difficult to factor into economic forecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board judged that the case for the 25 basis point rise was, at this time, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore persuasive. However, the judgement was finely balanced and the Board would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to review whether policy was sufficiently restrictive to return inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the 2–3 per cent target within a reasonable period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to raise the cash rate by 25 basis points to 7.0 per cent, effective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6 February.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

The low level of activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad led to a fall in the stock of unsold new houses, despite the low level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof current sales.

Housing construction activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad experienced a significant downturn since mid 2007, triggered by the introduction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof tighter safety requirements for buildings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in the euro area had slowed over the course of 2007, to a rate just over 2\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper cent, which was around trend.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that, in contrast, recent GDP data for the smaller east Asian economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been strong, with the year-ended pace of growth of 6 per cent at the upper\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the range of recent years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to an assessment of inflation in the Asian region as a whole, the latest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata showed inflation in China of over 7 per cent, mostly because of rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfood prices. Members noted that the recent pick-up in consumer price inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not been confined to China; inflation in other east Asian economies was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow around 4 per cent. Monetary policy settings throughout the region remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpansionary, with interest rates becoming negative in real terms as inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad drifted higher.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodity prices had risen strongly in the past few months.

Members felt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat while various supply-side explanations had contributed to the short-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovements, the main underlying factor was a continuation of strong demand,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a result of the high rates of growth in particular parts of the world economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBefore reviewing developments in the domestic economy, members noted that the national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounts for the December quarter were to be released the next day. They were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbriefed on the Bank's assessment that the data published so far on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmain expenditure and income components suggested growth in GDP could be around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t½ per cent in the quarter and around 3½ per cent over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe year, assuming no revisions. Domestic demand was expected to have increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby over 5 per cent through the year. Data released during the meeting,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowing that net external trade had subtracted significantly from growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe December quarter, along with strong growth in public demand, were not regarded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas having a material net effect on the forecast for output growth in the quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers then turned to their review of recent developments in the domestic economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand considered the information provided by the run of regular data releases,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcovering household consumption, the housing, business and external sectors,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the labour market and wages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales had increased rapidly over the course of 2007. The data for January,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were released during the meeting, indicated that sales were flat in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, though they had grown strongly over the past year. Strong growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold disposable income, which was around 8 per cent in real terms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the September quarter, had underpinned growth in consumption.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIndustry sources suggested that conditions in the retail sector had been mixed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring February. Members noted that consumer sentiment had fallen in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths and was now below average, though sentiment had not always been a reliable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicator of short-term movements in consumption.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDiscussion then turned to developments in the housing sector. Housing construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas seen as providing a source of future growth in activity, as the current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel of commencements was running well below estimates of underlying requirements,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbased on population growth and household formation, and vacancy rates were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat record lows. Although the sharp fall in building approvals in December had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunwound the previously apparent growth in approvals, members recognised that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis might have reflected data volatility. They were informed that the Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliaison with builders indicated that conditions were not as weak as suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the December building approvals figures.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the secondary housing market, house prices had increased relatively strongly on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta nationwide basis over the course of 2007. However, growth in house prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Perth had ceased, after prices had reached a high level, and house prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some outer suburbs of Sydney continued to be weak. In the main auction markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Sydney and Melbourne, which reflect sales activity at the upper end of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket, conditions had softened in February. Auction clearance rates had fallen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoticeably in both cities, and were now a little below average in Sydney and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout average in Melbourne, having been close to peak levels in that city in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmid 2007.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemand for housing finance was now easing somewhat, with the monthly rate of growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof housing credit having fallen from around 1 per cent in mid 2007 to around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0.8 per cent, on average, in the past several months. This was at the lower\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the range over the past decade. Loan approvals as a share of credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutstanding had also fallen since mid 2007.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the business sector, members observed that the NAB survey for the month of January\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowed a divergence between business conditions and business confidence. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness conditions index, which reflected activity and sales, had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell above average levels, though it had flattened out, while business confidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell sharply and was now below average. The latter was a more subjective indicator,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the latest movement most likely reflected global financial problems and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttighter financial conditions domestically. The Sensis survey of small and medium\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses continued to show that these businesses were more concerned about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinding quality staff than a lack of work or sales.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusinesses planned to increase investment in the year ahead, according to the latest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital expenditure survey, and business credit growth had risen steadily over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past 12 months, to about 24 per cent per annum. Part of this increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected the process of reintermediation as capital market funding for businesses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad dried up for all but the largest companies. But total provision of credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the business sector had nevertheless accelerated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the external sector, members were informed that import volumes were estimated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have increased strongly in the December quarter and over the course of 2007.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increases were associated with the rapid growth in domestic demand, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as owing something to the higher exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board examined trends in commodity prices, which were picking up again after\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta flat period in the middle of last year, and would again contribute significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto growth in domestic incomes. They would also be a source of cost pressure\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor some businesses in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNew contract iron ore prices for 2008, which in January had been expected to rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby around 40 per cent, were now likely to rise by at least 65 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbased on a recent Japanese settlement with a Brazilian producer. A similar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpattern was emerging in the market for coal, where the current spot price was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore than double the 2007 contract price. Part of the pressure on coal prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad come from Chinese demand, as China had recently switched to being a net\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timporter of coal.

Elsewhere, further rate cuts were expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the UK, and also in Canada, where a significant easing had been priced in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the market, given the linkages between the Canadian and US economies.

The dollar had reached a new low against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe euro and on a trade-weighted basis. The euro had continued to rise in foreign\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange markets and was now at a record high in real effective terms. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls in the US dollar had been accompanied by increases in the renminbi exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate, though these had not been large enough to forestall a fall in the Chinese\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffective exchange rate. Members observed that the recently higher inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate in China implied there had been some appreciation of China's real\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had moved higher over the past month, supported by high interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferentials, strong economic data and increases in commodity prices. In trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms, the exchange rate had increased by 4 per cent over the month and by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10 per cent over the past year.

The Bank had increased exchange settlement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbalances in the past few weeks, but by a smaller amount than at the time of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rises in spreads in September and December, as the stresses in the overnight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket had not been as evident as in the earlier episodes. Current market pricing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that a rise in the cash rate at this meeting, and a further tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby mid year, was expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers then discussed recent trends in bank funding. Access to funding had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treadily available, and banks’ offshore issuance in the first two months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the year had been very large. Issuance had been in several major markets,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly the US private placement market. There had been a large amount\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof domestic issuance as well.

The funding pressures had already\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen passed on to business lending rates, which were mostly linked to bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbill rates.

Growth in the world economy was likely to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe below trend this year and next, but at the same time very strong rises in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkey commodity prices would lift the terms of trade noticeably, thereby providing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan additional boost to domestic incomes. If anything, commodity prices looked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger than previously. Labour market conditions had remained strong early\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2008 and reports of high capacity usage and shortages of suitable labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersisted. In the near term, inflation was likely to rise further in year‑ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms from its already-high level. It would then probably moderate during 2009,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin response to the forecast slowing in demand. There was some evidence, albeit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttentative, that a slowing in private demand was starting to emerge, but its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\textent remained uncertain. Overall, the economy still faced a period in which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation could be uncomfortably high. Members were mindful as well of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisk that further increases in inflationary expectations could influence future\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twage and price outcomes, which could complicate the task of reducing inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHence, the question remained whether the current stance of monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back towards <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover a reasonable period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn judging the appropriate extent of further tightening, members also recognised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat developments in financial markets in recent months, both overseas and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Australia, had increased funding costs for intermediaries by more than the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects of past and expected future policy changes. Prior to the meeting, 90-day\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket yields on private paper had reached around 8 per cent, up by about 150 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints since the middle of 2007. Rates for borrowers from intermediaries were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to rise by more than any increase in the cash rate, reflecting these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher funding costs. Members also noted the possibility of non-price tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof credit terms, which, if it occurred, would add to the restraint imposed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby higher interest rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn balance, members concluded that a further 25 basis point rise in the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas necessary to restrain demand, in order to reduce inflation over time. As\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta result of this decision and earlier policy adjustments, and rises in borrowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts that were occurring independently of changes in monetary policy, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw the overall tightening in financial conditions since the middle of 2007\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas substantial. They judged that the higher setting of the cash rate would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleave adequate flexibility to respond as necessary over the months ahead to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew information about prospects for economic activity and inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided to raise the cash rate by 25 basis points to 7.25 per cent, effective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5 March.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

While these IMF forecasts had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen marked down by about ½ percentage point for each year from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose published in January, they were in line with staff forecasts for Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor trading partners made earlier in the year. They implied that the global\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic downturn would be relatively mild compared with earlier episodes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main driver of the slowing in growth was the weakness of the US economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to some extent the other G7 economies.

Housing construction activity had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto weaken and house prices were still falling. The main source of growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy was exports, which were being stimulated by the low level of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar exchange rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic growth in China had continued to be very strong, with industrial production\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill expanding by over 15 per cent per annum.

The growth in domestic demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas much faster, at 5.7 per cent over the year, and had been met partly by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trapidly rising imports, which reflected pressures on domestic productive capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas well as the high exchange rate.

Consumer sentiment had fallen sharply over the past few months, most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely reflecting tighter financial conditions and the financial market turmoil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore generally. Motor vehicle sales had fallen in February, but it was not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyet clear whether this marked a break from the strongly rising trend over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast two years. Members noted that rising sales of motor vehicles had not been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatched by increased domestic production; the latter had remained fairly steady\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past decade, with a growing share of demand being met by imports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDiscussion turned to the housing sector.

Looking through the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatility, growth in average earnings appeared to have picked up only modestly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past few years. In other wages data, there had been no pick-up in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pace of wages growth associated with recent new enterprise agreements,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleaving the rate of growth of wages in current enterprise agreements steady\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat 4 per cent during 2007.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that the CPI data for the March quarter, to be released towards\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe end of April, were likely to show inflation of around 4 per cent on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta year-ended basis in the March quarter. A large quarterly increase was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly because of recent rises in retail petrol prices. Underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas also expected to rise in year-ended terms in the March quarter, before\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclining over time. The staff's inflation forecast through to 2010 would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe revised after the release of the March quarter CPI, but the preliminary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassessment, based on current policy settings, was that inflation on both a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCPI and underlying basis would fall by a little more than earlier thought over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next two to three years. This was premised on demand growth slowing sufficiently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto reduce capacity pressures. Members recognised that a considerable degree\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof uncertainty continued to surround the outlook for both demand and inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board noted that there had been substantial volatility in financial markets over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past month. Much of the latest bout of volatility was the consequence of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe process of de-leveraging, notably by hedge funds, which had faced margin\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalls and subsequently needed to sell assets. It also reflected the near-collapse\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Bear Stearns, an investment bank that had been at the centre of the financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrisis since mid 2007, and its rescue through a take-over by JPMorgan Chase,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfacilitated by the Federal Reserve assuming some of the risk in the Bear Stearns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tportfolio.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInformation on the US mortgage market showed that delinquencies, defined as loans\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat were 30 days or more overdue, and foreclosures had continued to rise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was reflected in both sub-prime and prime loans, though foreclosures were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar higher on sub-prime than prime loans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to financial market conditions more generally, there had been a tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof conditions in the market for term paper, peaking around the time of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trescue of Bear Stearns, but this had since eased somewhat. However, conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained tight in short-term money markets. Partly, this reflected end-quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbalance-sheet adjustments. The G10 central banks had announced co-ordinated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taction to increase US dollar swap lines between the Federal Reserve and European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCentral Bank and Swiss National Bank, which was similar to action taken in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 2007. The Fed had also announced significant changes to its framework\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor domestic market operations, which extended the list of counterparties with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich it dealt and the collateral that it would accept. These changes did not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvolve any significant net injection of liquidity to the system, but gave\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional flexibility for providing liquidity when it was needed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the process of de-leveraging, which was evident in many financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets. Among those affected was the European government bond market, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspreads between yields on German government bonds and those on bonds of several\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother countries had widened sharply in March as liquidity dried up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVolatility in share prices had also continued to be very high. Net movements in share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices around the world in March had been modest, however, with small falls\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin most markets apart from Japan, where share prices had fallen by a larger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamount owing to the effect of the appreciating yen on listed Japanese exporters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare prices in China, India and other emerging economies had fallen sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past month. Financial stocks globally had fallen more than other stocks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand were now back to 2005 levels. Reflecting the high weighting of financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstocks in the Australian share market, it had fallen by more than most other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshare markets since its peak in November 2007.

Elsewhere,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe European Central Bank had continued to hold its policy setting steady,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighlighting ongoing inflation risks. Policy rates were also steady in Japan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the UK, but had been cut by 50 basis points in Canada. There had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther policy tightening in China, though policy settings in other emerging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies were generally steady.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted the large movements in currencies over the past month. In terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovements against the US dollar, the yen was at its highest level since 1995\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the euro had reached a new high. The euro was at a high in real effective\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms also. The US dollar had depreciated sharply in real effective terms,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand on this measure was close to the lows recorded over the past two decades.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe renminbi had continued to appreciate gradually against the US dollar, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepreciate against the euro. Owing to relatively high inflation in China compared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith its main trading partners, the renminbi had risen in real effective terms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had experienced large swings over the past month. Intraday\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatility was among the highest in recent years, against both the US dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the yen. Over the past month, in trade-weighted terms the Australian dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate fell by 4 per cent, with depreciation against most currencies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the basket, particularly the yen and the Swiss franc. Over the year, however,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Australian dollar TWI was about 4 per cent higher; over a longer period,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe TWI was currently about 15 per cent above its post-float average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the domestic money market, members noted the 90-day bank bill rate had peaked\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove 8 per cent during the month, a very large spread to the expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcash rate, but had fallen since mid March to be around 7¾ per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bank had increased exchange settlement balances during the month and conducted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore operations at longer terms, between 90–180 days, where liquidity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas needed. There had been no deviation of the cash rate from the target.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers then discussed recent trends in bond issuance by Australian banks, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad continued apace in the first quarter of 2008. The large amount of bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuance by the banks in part reflected strong growth in balance sheets, owing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the increased corporate demand for bank credit after the drying up of activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the corporate bond market in Australia. Members observed that the banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad acted as a shock-absorber in terms of corporate funding. The large bond\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tissuance by the banks also reflected a precautionary element. Bond issuance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffshore had accounted for the bulk of total issuance. Yields paid by Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks on their debt had continued to rise in line with international trends.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe further rises in banks' funding costs over the past month had been passed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton to borrowers in the form of higher lending rates. Business funding had risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trapidly, partly owing to reintermediation, though there were some signs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing in the pace of business credit expansion in February.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that financial results published during the latest corporate reporting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseason showed that the rise in debt levels among companies had been only modest.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent pricing in the money market indicated that no change in the cash rate was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected at this meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recommendation to the Board was to leave the cash rate unchanged at 7.25 per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn considering their policy decision, Board members noted that developments in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal economy over the past month were consistent with the world growth forecasts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutlined in the previous month. These included weak outcomes for the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates. Growth in the emerging economies looked set to moderate, but remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively strong. Overall growth in the world economy in 2008 and 2009 was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be below the average of recent years.

The labour market had also remained very strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough to February. However, other recent information, including through liaison\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsources, provided indications that domestic demand was slowing. Business and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumer sentiment had softened in the early part of 2008, and retail sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad slowed, as had household credit demand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the economy continued to be affected by a number of cross-currents.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLarge increases in real income were likely to flow from further increases in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe terms of trade, foreshadowed by recent contract price negotiations for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkey bulk commodities. On the other hand, the slowing global economy and tighter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial conditions in Australia were likely to reduce expansionary forces\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the economy. Members judged that, taking account of the additional rises\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin funding costs that banks had passed on to borrowers, the current stance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof monetary policy was exerting a significant restraining influence on both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds and businesses.

The various\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures of underlying inflation were similar to the CPI over the latest year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe general increase in inflationary pressure was the result of strong growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin domestic demand in the face of limited spare capacity and rapid growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices over the past few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn their discussion, members noted that the increase in prices over the past year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been broadly based, with three-quarters of the items in the CPI basket,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby weight, rising faster than 2.5 per cent per annum.

Subsequently,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-farm GDP growth was expected to increase over the rest of the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, but remain below trend. This slowing in GDP reflected much weaker growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin domestic demand. This, in turn, was the net outcome of significant opposing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces: weaker world growth and tighter domestic financial conditions (some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof which were due to difficulties in financial markets) were likely to moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, while the strong rise in incomes resulting from the terms of trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould boost demand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe forecast for inflation was for both the headline and underlying measures to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove 4 per cent through to late 2008.

The forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecline in inflation was driven by the easing of capacity strains as a result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof below-trend growth in non-farm GDP.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn discussing the outlook, members noted that there was considerable uncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the forecasts for demand, production and inflation, given the nature and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsize of the opposing forces operating on the economy at present.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p id=\"Body\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers examined the improvement in sentiment in financial markets that had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparent over the past month.

Spreads in these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets had risen in April despite significant changes to operating procedures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby central banks in the United States and United Kingdom, in particular. These\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvolved dealing at longer maturities, transacting with a wider range of counterparties\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand accepting a broader range of collateral.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that while there had been ongoing strains in money markets in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmajor economies, the position in Australia was more settled, and there was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta general sense that funding conditions domestically were improving. The three-month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLIBOR to swap spread in the Australian market was now back at the low end of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe international range, which had been the situation for most of the period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the onset of the financial crisis. The Bank had reduced aggregate daily\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange settlement balances to below $2 billion from the level of over $5\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbillion reached at the end of the March quarter. During the past month, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank had on occasion dealt at longer-than-usual maturities and had accepted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresidential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) under repurchase agreements.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis provided some support for activity in the RMBS market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board's discussion then moved to monetary policy settings around the world.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was noted that while three major central banks (the Federal Reserve, Bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Canada and Bank of England) had reduced policy rates, central banks in many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother countries were concerned about inflation. It was also noted that market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpectations were that the Fed had now completed the easing process. Most other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloped economy central banks had held interest rates steady. Central banks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin emerging economies were generally tightening monetary policy. The People's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of China, for example, had tightened monetary policy settings again and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had been increases in policy rates in India, Brazil, South Africa and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome eastern European countries.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at foreign exchange markets, members noted that the US dollar had recovered\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat from the all-time low against the euro in April, but that it remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnear historic lows on a trade-weighted basis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had appreciated against most currencies over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe trade-weighted index had risen by 4 per cent over the month and by about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8 per cent over the past year. Members thought that the rise of the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate over recent months had been less than might have been expected given the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength of commodity prices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn reviewing developments in capital markets, members noted that bond issuance by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian banks had returned to around average levels over March, April and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearly May after the very large raisings in the first two months of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were tentative signs that banks' bond spreads, while still high,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight have peaked. There had been some corporate issuance in recent weeks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing very little activity in the fourth quarter of 2007. Conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe domestic RMBS market also seemed to be improving, following a period in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary and March in which there had been a large amount of distressed selling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom offshore as portfolios were liquidated.

Since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJuly 2007, apart from the increases attributable to the cash rate, there had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen an additional 40 basis point increase on housing loans and a 55–65 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint increase on business loans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there had been a large fall in margin lending in recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcentrated particularly in very large loans.

Household spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been subdued over recent months and demand for credit by both households\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand businesses had weakened. Nevertheless, CPI and underlying inflation had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisen further and was uncomfortably high. Price rises had been widespread,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin an environment of limited capacity and strong growth in demand in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial conditions were now tight, following the rises in the cash rate since mid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2007, the additional market-induced increases in lending rates and the tougher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending standards for some borrowers imposed by lenders in the past few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking ahead, members could see powerful opposing forces affecting the Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy. On the one hand, the slowdown in the developed economies, the ongoing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrains in world financial markets and tight domestic financial conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere working to slow demand and activity. Working in the other direction was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe larger-than-expected stimulus to domestic incomes from the rising terms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof trade that would flow from the very large recent increases in bulk commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontract prices.

The staff forecast was that inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould return to the target by the end of the forecast period in 2010, if the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent slowing in demand was sustained. This would most likely be associated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith output growth falling to quite low rates in the year ahead, something\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was required to ease pressure on capacity and slow the pass-through by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses of higher input costs. Even so, members noted that the forecast\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpath for inflation involved it remaining above 4 per cent for much of 2008.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis carried the risk that expectations of high ongoing inflation could develop,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich could in turn affect price- and wage-setting behaviour.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe question therefore remained whether the setting of monetary policy was sufficiently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestrictive to secure low inflation over time.

But on balance, given\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe substantial tightening in financial conditions since mid 2007, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\textent of uncertainty surrounding the outlook, the Board decided that it was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappropriate to allow the current setting of monetary policy more time to work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, should demand not slow as expected or should expectations of high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tongoing inflation begin to affect wage and price setting, the outlook, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe stance of policy, would need to be reviewed.

Nonetheless, business investment remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a high level as a share of GDP. The March quarter capital expenditure survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that investment intentions among businesses were still very strong,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing well ahead of similar estimates made a year earlier.

The Bank had lowered exchange settlement balances\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto around $1¾ billion and the interest rates that the Bank's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcounterparties were bidding had returned to pre-crisis levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe major development in global financial markets in the month was a rise in government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbond yields in the major markets, reflecting an increased focus on inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisks among market participants.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBond yields had also risen in Australia.

While the appreciation of 10 per cent of the renminbi against the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar over the past year had been substantial, this was largely a reflection\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof US dollar weakness. The renminbi had depreciated by 5 per cent against the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro, which had dampened the increase in the effective exchange rate of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenminbi over the past year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar appreciated further against all the currencies in the trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasket over the past month, and had almost reached post-float highs against\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US dollar. Higher bulk commodity prices had been an important spur to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise in the exchange rate.

In line with the improvement in financial market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentiment, recent issues had been at lower spreads than previous issues and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaturities had lengthened. Conditions in the domestic residential mortgage-backed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecurities market had also improved, but the high cost of most recent issues\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested they had not been a very profitable source of funding for issuers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, demand appeared to be quite healthy, which pointed to improving prospects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor this part of the market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExpectations for monetary policy in Australia, as reflected in pricing in the money\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket, had fluctuated over the past month.

These included flat retail sales, declining household and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommercial loan approvals, lower growth in housing and business credit, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubdued business and consumer confidence. Asset markets were also less buoyant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan previously. Labour market conditions, on the other hand, had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong to date.

In discussing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe outlook, they noted that there remained considerable uncertainty in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts for demand and inflation, as there were strongly opposing forces\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toperating on the economy. While financial conditions were working to moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand, the rise in Australia's terms of trade that was currently occurring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould work in the opposite direction, and would add substantially to national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome and ability to spend. There was also a high degree of uncertainty about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe international economic outlook, in particular the extent of the slowdown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was occurring in the developed economies.

This series is less reliably measured than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales by large retailers and it is more cyclically sensitive, but growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsales of large retailers was also slowing. Liaison with retailers conducted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the staff was consistent with the weaker trend in retail sales figures in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months.

Lower returns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom superannuation investments arising from falling equity prices, at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmargin, could also reduce households' willingness to spend. Working in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other direction in the near term were the income tax cuts scheduled to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommence on 1 July, which would add about 1 per cent to household income\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the course of the new financial year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the housing sector, members observed that the near-term outlook for housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity remained soft, with dwelling approvals and commencements declining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the early months of 2008.

This was a significant change from the strong rate of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease over 2007.

A range of business surveys suggested that conditions across\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost sectors had also moderated, though the slowing seemed milder than in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase of household activity. The national accounts for the June quarter, to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe published in early September, were likely to show that growth of GDP had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen low, and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter was also possible. There were some early signs of slowing in the labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket. In addition, while global economic growth in the first half of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear had been reasonable in aggregate, over the past month there had been signs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof weaker conditions in more of the major economies. Moreover, the effects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the global credit market disruption had intensified again recently, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis had led to a further tightening of financial conditions domestically over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past few weeks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation, as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections. Tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the other hand, the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto national income and capacity to spend. On balance, it was now looking more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely that demand would remain on a slower track, and economic growth would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe fairly slow, over the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe staff forecast for growth of the Australian economy over the year ahead had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlowered slightly and remained below consensus.

If that occurred, the cost of reducing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation later would be greater.

Given there had been a significant change in borrowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbehaviour, confidence was weaker, asset prices had declined and slower overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was in prospect, tighter financial conditions were not warranted.

Growth had been boosted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby exports, following the substantial depreciation of the US dollar. Although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tax cuts earlier in the year had supported consumption and allowed a rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the saving ratio in the June quarter, the recent monthly data indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalls in consumption in real terms in June and July. The housing sector had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubtracted sizeably from growth over the past year. However, there was some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence of a slowing in the rate of decline in house prices, house sales and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing starts, which suggested that the subtraction from growth from residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment spending would ease.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the US labour market painted a somewhat weaker picture of growth than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe GDP data.

Newspaper job advertisements had been falling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor several months and internet vacancies had also begun to ease, though the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market was still tight given the high level of vacancies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the business sector, members observed that the NAB survey suggested that overall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness conditions had now fallen from peak levels to below average. The more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjective measure of business confidence remained well below average. Capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutilisation had eased, but was still at a high level.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in lending to businesses remained weak. In recent months total business debt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been rising at an annualised rate of about 5 per cent, which was a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificant slowing from the experience of the previous few years. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved that the pick-up in borrowing from banks in the latter part of 2007\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas partly a result of financial reintermediation owing to the credit crisis,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut was also boosted by new lending to fund mergers and acquisitions deals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat had been announced earlier in 2007. Growth in lending to large businesses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom foreign-owned banks had slowed by more than lending by domestically owned\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA large rise in export receipts in the June quarter, which mainly reflected higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices for key commodity exports, had led to a modest trade surplus in that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Some further increase in export prices was expected in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter as the recent price increases were fully passed through. As a result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the developments in the trade balance, the current account deficit narrowed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignificantly in the June quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProfits of non-financial companies had increased strongly in the June quarter, especially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the mining sector. Preliminary estimates suggested that business investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad risen solidly in the June quarter. The latest capital expenditure survey\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that investment intentions among businesses for 2008/09 had risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly, in mining as well as other sectors, to be well ahead of similar estimates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade a year earlier. These intentions suggested a very large rise in nominal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspending on investment in the current financial year, though the results of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis survey were usually associated with a high degree of uncertainty. Taken\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat face value, there would be a further increase in the already-high share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof investment in GDP, which was difficult to reconcile with confidence measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom other business surveys. One possibility was that many business surveys\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderweighted the importance of the mining sector in the overall economy at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent, but it was also possible that investment intentions might be scaled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback over the course of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith the national accounts for the June quarter to be released the next day, discussion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the domestic economy concluded with members being briefed about the partial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata released in the few days prior to the meeting and during the meeting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese data pointed to a modest rise in GDP in the quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA major development in financial markets over the past month was the appreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the US dollar from its recent historic low levels, which had been reached\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter several years of depreciation against the other major currencies.

The exchange rate had depreciated against all the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrencies in the trade-weighted basket, though the depreciation against the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teuro and other European currencies had been relatively small. The depreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been driven by both changing market perceptions about relative interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferentials and the recent broad-based decline in commodity prices.

The tightening in financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions, owing to increases in the cash rate and rises in the cost of funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin financial markets, together with higher oil prices, had worked to dampen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand and economic activity. Household sector spending was weak, with wealth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving fallen and higher interest rates and tighter credit standards impinging\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton spending decisions. Business conditions had noticeably softened since the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddle of the year and confidence and credit growth to both households and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusinesses was now quite modest. Indicators of capacity utilisation, while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill high, had declined and there had also been some signs of an easing in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut investment spending had been strong and surveys of investment intentions indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit would rise further in the year ahead. Overall, the picture seemed to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of weak consumption and strong investment, but with aggregate growth of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand slowing. Members noted also that there was still considerable stimulus\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto domestic activity coming from the external sector. The run-up in commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had increased Australia's terms of trade, adding substantially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto national income and capacity to spend. Looking ahead, however, the world\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomy was slowing and it was therefore unlikely that the external stimulus\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Australia would be as strong in the year ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn weighing these various factors, members concluded that the slowdown in demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Board had been seeking was unfolding. A necessary precondition for a decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin inflation back towards the target was therefore in place, even though evidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor that decline would not be seen in the figures for some time. This outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas predicated on continued restraint in wage demands, helped by some softening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin labour market conditions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGiven that assessment, and that financial conditions had been quite tight –\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had tightened a little further recently – the question then became\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat what point it would be prudent to move to a less restrictive setting of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy. There were risks in easing too soon, since the evidence for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe expected fall in inflation was still some time away. Moreover, as inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneeded to fall a significant way to be consistent with the target, policy could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed to be on the restrictive side of normal for some time ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, there were also risks in waiting too long to have some easing of policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom a quite restrictive setting. In that event, demand could weaken more sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan necessary.

Government bond yields had declined as investors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsought the safety of sovereign fixed interest securities.

Equity markets in emerging economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere also sharply lower. Further declines in commodity prices had led to falls\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin non-financial shares, whereas, until recently, falls in equity markets had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen driven mainly by falls in financial shares. Declining prices of shares\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin other sectors of the market suggested that investors were starting to price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a significant downturn in the global economy.

The run on these funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso led to Treasury bill yields falling to zero as investors switched to government\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt, and, subsequently, to the provision of a capital value guarantee on money\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket fund assets by the US Treasury.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal money markets had been dysfunctional.

The increase in retail sales in August, in particular,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas unlikely to have been as large as the seasonally adjusted figure suggested,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the large stores, which were fully enumerated in the survey, had not recorded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany increase in sales. Although retail sales in the early part of the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter had been stronger than in the June quarter, assisted by lower petrol\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices and income tax cuts, liaison conducted by the staff suggested that conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad deteriorated in September.

However, the latest economic data predated the onset of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe current bout of financial market turmoil. The June quarter national accounts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad presented a picture of weak consumption and strong investment, with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taggregate growth of demand slowing. While investment spending had been strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the June quarter, and stated expectations by firms in July\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand August had been for further strength in the year ahead, it was becoming\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore likely that these intentions would be scaled back. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe expansionary effects of the recent surge in Australia's terms of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade were still being felt. With the world economy clearly slowing, however,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand many commodity prices now having fallen significantly from their peaks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe external stimulus to Australian incomes and demand was expected to fade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the September quarter CPI, to be released before the next meeting, was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto show an increase of around 5 per cent over the year, members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the current staff forecast was for inflation to start to decline in 2009.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, the recent deterioration in global growth prospects, together with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe more difficult market conditions even for creditworthy borrowers, increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe risk that demand and output could be significantly weaker than earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected.

It was acknowledged that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent level of interest rates meant that monetary policy had significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity to provide stimulus.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn assessing the recommendation, members observed that an easing of 100 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints would bring forward some of the easing markets had already priced in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor following months. The increased downside risks to growth and the improved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprospects for lower inflation meant that there was a strong economic case to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo so. As staff estimates suggested that banks' funding costs had risen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby about 20–25 basis points relative to relevant benchmarks, any\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduction in interest rates that banks announced on loans to customers would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost likely be less than the change in the cash rate by a similar margin.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board considered the possibility that a larger-than-expected easing of 100 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints could have a negative effect on market sentiment.

Spending on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmotor vehicles and durables was very weak, while spending on services had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto grow, but at a slower pace.

Weakness in retail sales over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear was concentrated in the smaller retailers, but these data were less reliable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan previously, owing to reduced sampling. Larger retailers recorded a small\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in retail sales in September, but liaison by the staff suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in October had weakened. Another indicator of consumption was motor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvehicle sales, which had fallen significantly in the September quarter.

The falls in equity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices thus far in the December quarter meant the fall was now larger.

Nonetheless, growth of business borrowing from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall sources had not slowed further recently, and appeared to have levelled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout at around 7–8 per cent per annum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn reviewing conditions in the labour market, members noted that there had been a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall rise in employment in September, but the data were volatile and the trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested employment growth was slowing from a peak of around 3 per cent late\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2007 to just over 1 per cent at present. Looking forward, job advertisements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand information from business surveys were both suggesting that the demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor labour was slowing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the effect of the falls in commodity prices on Australia's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texternal position. Bulk commodity prices had fallen sharply in the past few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths. Iron ore and thermal coal prices had fallen by around 60 per cent and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t40 per cent, respectively, since their peaks; spot prices were now well below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe most recent contract prices for those commodities. Base metals prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfallen significantly from their recent peak earlier in the year and were around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels of three years ago. Rural commodity prices had also fallen noticeably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past year. Oil prices had fallen sharply, with the Tapis crude oil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice now around US$60 per barrel. As had been observed previously, the decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the oil price had not been as marked in Australian dollar terms, as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texchange rate had depreciated significantly over the past few months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite the recent falls in commodity prices, the price rises earlier in the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor bulk commodity contract prices had led to a significant narrowing of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent account deficit from its peak of 7 per cent earlier in the year. However,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe terms of trade were expected to fall noticeably over the forecast period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas bulk commodity prices were adjusted down again.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were then briefed on the September quarter CPI and the outlook for growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand inflation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CPI increased by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter and by 5 per cent in year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms. Underlying inflation was slightly above 4½ per cent, with the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarterly rate levelling out at a little over 1 per cent. These outcomes were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroadly in line with expectations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers observed that an internationally comparable definition of core inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcluding food, energy and financial services showed a less pronounced pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan the headline CPI suggested, but was nonetheless now around 3½ per\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcent per annum. In contrast, this measure of core inflation in other developed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries had been broadly flat at 2 per cent per annum for several years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tData on wage increases associated with enterprise bargaining agreements indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat wages growth was stable at around 4 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that the staff forecasts were for output growth to be well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow trend. GDP growth would receive a boost in the December and March quarters\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the recently announced fiscal stimulus package, but the underlying trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin growth was lower than expected three months earlier. This would act to put\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater downward pressure on inflation, though the recent exchange rate depreciation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould have a countervailing influence. In the short term, CPI inflation would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe reduced by recent falls in petrol prices; if current petrol prices were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustained, they would produce a noticeable fall in headline inflation in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter. This could assist in containing inflation expectations.

A positive sign, however, was that in the past week there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been some narrowing in spreads and some lengthening in debt issuance in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe United States. Spreads in the United Kingdom and euro area were still high.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe money market in Australia had continued generally to fare better than those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverseas.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring the month, the Federal Reserve introduced a number of new facilities to provide\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliquidity and extended some existing facilities. US dollar swap arrangements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere extended to additional central banks and some existing swap lines were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased to provide unlimited amounts of US dollars at a fixed price. These\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactions appeared to be working in reducing liquidity strains in the market,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the cost of US dollar funding outside the United States declining. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFed's balance sheet had increased substantially and was now more than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble its size a year ago.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the significant monetary policy responses to the slowdown over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, members noted the co-ordinated rate cuts by a number of developed country\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentral banks early in October and further reductions later in the month, including\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and the Riksbank. In addition, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of Japan eased policy by 20 basis points and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcut its policy rate by 100 basis points. Market participants expected there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be further sizeable monetary policy easing, including by the European\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCentral Bank and the Bank of England later in the week. The market was still\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpricing in more rate cuts by those central banks in coming months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMonetary policy had also been eased in several developing economies. The People's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank of China had reduced rates twice, following a period of tightening monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy over the previous four years, and the Reserve Bank of India had cut\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits policy rate by 150 basis points. The Bank of Korea had cut its rate by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t100 basis points at an emergency policy meeting and, in an unusual move given\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits currency peg to the US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority had initiated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan additional cut to that of the Federal Reserve. However, interest rates were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing increased in some countries in response to sharp currency depreciations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal share markets had been extremely volatile during October and had fallen sharply.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome of the fall had been reversed late in the month.

Movements in the exchange rate had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen driven by the deterioration in the global economic outlook, falls in commodity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices and the general unwinding of leveraged investment positions. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere briefed that the Australian dollar appeared to have been used as a proxy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor less liquid investments, including emerging market currencies.

On a number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccasions, when conditions in the foreign exchange market had become particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthin, the Bank had purchased Australian dollars to provide liquidity. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere informed that these instances of intervention were not designed to defend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany particular level of the exchange rate. The exchange rate had depreciated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby more than 20 per cent over the past year and was now about 5 per cent below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits post-float average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn looking at government bond markets in developed countries, members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had been relatively less volatile over the past month.

However, there were signs of the financial dislocation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the euro area, increased risk aversion among investors had seen spreads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton non-German government debt widen to levels that predated European Monetary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmerging market sovereign spreads had also widened noticeably over the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the Australian money market, members noted that market yields had moved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply lower following the announcement of the reduction in the cash rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 100 basis points in October.

The collateral that the Bank would accept in its dealing operations was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso widened. The size of the Bank's balance sheet had expanded; on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassets side this was mainly the result of the larger repo book and the US dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswap arrangement with the Fed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the latest bank earnings results, noting that they had been solid\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the current circumstances.

There had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen very sharp exchange rate movements, including a large depreciation of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Australian dollar. The availability of credit in global markets had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be tight, though members noted that the measures announced by governments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto strengthen their financial systems should help to stabilise conditions over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tData on the world economy indicated a further deterioration in economic conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the major industrial economies, and there had been further signs that China\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand other parts of the developing world were now slowing. In Australia, until\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently, the overall path of economic activity had been roughly in line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Board's earlier expectations. However, the marked deterioration in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglobal financial conditions over the past couple of months, which had also\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad an effect on Australian financial markets and share prices, was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have a significant effect as well on business and consumer sentiment, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliaison information was reflecting this. This would probably lead to a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurtailment of planned investment spending and caution on the part of households.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers judged that the recent reductions in interest rates on loans following earlier\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpolicy action, the depreciation of the exchange rate and the fiscal stimulus\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannounced in October would cushion, but probably not fully offset, the negative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces on the domestic economy arising from deteriorating international conditions,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlower commodity prices and lower household wealth. As such, members thought\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat domestic spending and activity would be weaker than earlier expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey noted that over the past month the staff forecast for growth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlowered and that, despite this, the most recent information suggested that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe risks to the outlook remained to the downside.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that consumer price inflation in Australia was again high in the September\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, as had been expected. However, with domestic capacity pressures now\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing and the outlook for much softer growth in demand and activity than had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen seen until recently, members could reasonably expect that inflation in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia would soon start to fall. Global disinflationary forces from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowdown in the world economy and lower commodity prices would assist in this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregard. The depreciation of the exchange rate, however, meant that the decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof inflation to the target could take longer than previously thought. While\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis could pose risks to inflationary expectations, these were regarded as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanageable in the context of a generally disinflationary environment over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnext couple of years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers agreed that a further sizeable reduction in official interest rates was appropriate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis would enable a further meaningful reduction in rates paid by borrowers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand could assist confidence among consumers and businesses.

While the US economy had been widely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to slow to a below-trend pace, GDP figures for the December quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand other recent indicators were relatively strong and suggested that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been no significant slowing in overall growth over the past two years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, GDP growth of 3½ per cent through 2006 remained slightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove trend and this could be a source of inflationary risk, which had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof concern to the Fed given the high level of resource utilisation in the economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the housing sector, starts had begun to stabilise after a fall of over 25 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, it was too soon to determine whether more falls were likely given\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe current conditions of oversupply, and whether the sharp slowing in housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction during 2006 would spread to other parts of the economy and dampen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity. At this stage, it appeared that growth in other sectors had remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively immune to conditions in the housing sector, and this suggested a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlessening in the downside risks to prospects for growth. Inflation figures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad indicated an easing in core inflation in recent months, from just below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3 per cent per annum to 2.6 per cent over the course of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2006.

There had been no particular reason to explain the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharp downward revision, and the cyclical pattern of growth over the past couple\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof years had remained intact. The Tankan business survey continued to indicate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthening conditions and suggested that the current expansion was continuing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a moderate pace.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn China, GDP growth through 2006 was above 10 per cent.

In other parts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof east Asia, the maturing of economies implied that growth rates were now\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcycling around a lower trend rate; GDP in Korea had increased by 4 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough 2006.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Europe, the only country for which December quarter GDP figures were available\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the UK.

The latest national accounts indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat productivity growth had been weak in recent years, with this evident from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth aggregate and disaggregated sectoral data. Similar trends had been seen,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough to a lesser extent, in the US and Canada, which also had puzzling strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin employment in the context of apparently weak productivity growth.

Growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin overall consumption had been supported by good growth in real disposable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold income, which had been a bit below 4 per cent over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear to the September quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the housing sector, there had been little change in total building approvals in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent months and the downturn appeared to have troughed. A modest uptrend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin residential building activity in the year ahead was expected, as approvals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere running below underlying demand and the rental market was tightening,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas seen by low and declining vacancy rates throughout the country. In addition,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trents were rising, by just below 4 per cent per annum according to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe CPI, and by 8 per cent for newly tenanted dwellings according\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a measure compiled by the Real Estate Institute. The latter data revealed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Brisbane and Perth appeared to have the most severe shortages of rental\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccommodation, with rents for newly tenanted dwellings in those cities rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby well over 10 per cent per annum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness investment slowed sharply during 2006, to growth of around 5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the September quarter, which followed rapid growth of 10–20 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper annum since 2002. Despite lower growth in the recent period, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprospect of slower growth in domestic demand as a consequence, the level of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestment as a share of GDP remained high, which would be adding to the capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstock. Business credit growth had slowed a little recently, but remained in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe 15–20 per cent range, as businesses geared up after a long period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof noticeably slower growth in borrowing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExports were estimated to have increased only moderately in volume terms in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, and by around 5 per cent over the year. Iron ore exports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased steadily over the past few years, while coal exports had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively flat, with various infrastructure bottlenecks constraining growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOil exports had been on a falling trend until recently, but the opening of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta new field had led to a pick-up in oil exports from mid 2006. Export receipts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased more rapidly than volumes over the past few years given rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity prices.

The estimates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor growth in exports and imports in the December quarter implied that international\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade would subtract significantly from output growth in the quarter, but the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength of imports suggested that there had been a pick-up in domestic demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowards the end of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the labour market, employment growth had been strong in both November and December,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith growth of 3 per cent through 2006.

The unemployment rate was 4.6 per cent at the end of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2006, a 30-year low, and the participation rate had risen noticeably over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse of the year. In a further sign of tightness in the labour market, job\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvacancies had increased to 1.5 per cent of the labour force, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the highest rate since the 1970s.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CPI indicated that prices fell by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand year-ended inflation declined to 3.3 per cent. The easing in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation pressures had been expected with petrol and banana prices both falling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply in the quarter. In underlying terms, inflation had increased from 2½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the end of 2005 to around 3 per cent in the September quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2006, where it had remained in the final quarter of the year.

These developments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflected the healthy state of the world economy. However, some signs of increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trisk-taking in financial markets had begun to emerge. While this was not threatening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat present, its continuation could pose risks. In particular, most countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad experienced a large increase in mergers and acquisitions activity, notably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleveraged buy-outs. Developments in China also needed to be monitored as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorities were struggling to offset the domestic liquidity effects of their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmassive intervention in the foreign exchange market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTuring to individual markets, share prices in the US rose by around 15 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2006, which was the fourth consecutive year of strong returns. This rise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook the market to within 5 per cent of the peak in 2000. Share markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin other developed countries had also been strong in 2006, apart from Japan,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere the market had been relatively flat following a very strong year in 2005.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmerging market share prices, particularly in Latin America, had been even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger than those in the major countries. The strength was the result of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta combination of improving economic conditions and a general increase in risk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappetite in global markets. The fact that volatility in share markets in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears had been about half its long-run average was encouraging investors to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmove into some risky assets.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBond yields had risen slightly over the past year or so, but remained low by historical\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandards. In the English-speaking countries and most of Asia, longer-term\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyields were lower than the respective cash rates, i.e. yield curves were inverted.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was a result of strong demand for bonds, including by Asian and Middle\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEastern central banks. In the US, bond yields had not changed in net terms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince mid 2004, though the Fed funds rate had risen significantly over that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit spreads on non-government bonds had continued to tighten, as a result of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsearch for yield and increased risk appetite.

In previous cycles, however, default rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton low-rated debt had increased to around 10–13 per cent when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic conditions deteriorated, well above current rates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCentral banks had increased cash rates during 2006.

Although markets through\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe second half of 2006 had been expecting significant easing by the Fed during\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2007, at present no change in the funds rate was expected over the next six\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths.

Growth for the quarter was strong, at 1 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe non-farm economy had grown by 1.4 per cent in the quarter and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3.5 per cent over the year, with the effect of the drought subtracting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t¾ percentage point from GDP growth over the past year. This had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought growth in output in the quarter and over the year more into line with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother indicators of economic activity – for example, conditions in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour market and information from business surveys. Members were informed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the staff viewed the apparent lift in growth in the economy as mostly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflecting catch-up from the earlier period of softer growth, though at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmargin there did appear to be a little more strength in demand than expected.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe stronger national accounts had also lifted measures of productivity. Non-farm\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabour productivity had increased by 1½ per cent over 2006,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was not far below average. This suggested that the earlier apparent weakness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin productivity had been partly a consequence of measurement factors, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome puzzles remained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOver the past year, domestic demand continued to run ahead of output, with net trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubtracting from GDP growth. Nonetheless, domestic demand had slowed, reflecting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta lower rate of business investment growth, which had been partly offset by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger consumption. The downturn in the housing sector was now reaching a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrough. Growth in public demand had been significantly higher than growth in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate demand, as the states had begun to spend heavily on infrastructure.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe gap between domestic demand and output had been sustained for an extended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod because domestic incomes had been boosted by the rising terms of trade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past few years. This meant that while growth in export volumes had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoor, export earnings growth had been considerably higher.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe monthly data on consumption were pointing to a strong result for the March quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales had increased at a robust rate in January and February and year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had increased to 6½–7 per cent. By state, growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin spending over the past year was most rapid in WA, but growth in spending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin NSW, though the lowest of the larger states, was still reasonable. Motor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvehicle sales in the first two months of the year were running 6 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the rate in the December quarter.

The earlier rapid growth in investment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeant that the current share of investment in GDP was high. Members noted that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was an inevitable element of pro-cyclicality in public investment spending,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas periods of rapid growth in private investment spending tended to require\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplementary investment in public infrastructure.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall business conditions had picked up in the first few months of the year, according\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the NAB survey.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to international trade, import volumes had increased sharply in the December\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter, to be 10 per cent higher over the year, reflecting strong\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic demand. The terms of trade had risen further in the December quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand were now clearly higher than the spike in 1974.

Despite a small fall in job vacancies shown\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the ABS survey in the three months to February, the level of vacancies remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh and was consistent with other signs of tightness in the labour market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers turned their attention to recent developments in economic conditions in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian states, as outlined in the Information Paper on ‘Regional\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomic Performance’. The most comprehensive measure of growth in state\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies was provided by gross state product, but these data were published\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly annually, with the most recent statistics available for 2005/06. In any\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevent, the data indicated that some divergence in growth among the states was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot uncommon, though it was noteworthy that NSW had underperformed the national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage for five consecutive years. The current dispersion in growth was partly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattributable to the upswing in commodity prices, which meant the underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic situation in the resource-rich states differed from that elsewhere\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the country.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother important factor in recent years had been divergences in housing cycles.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs well as having direct economic effects, the housing cycle was interacting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith population growth, adding to the economic divergence. NSW had experienced\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe most severe housing downturn, and population growth in NSW had slowed sharply\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent years. Recently, however, the rate of net interstate migration from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNSW had declined.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth was seen as a more reliable, up-to-date indicator of overall growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the states than indicators derived from the national accounts. Although\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNSW had been below average, all states had recorded reasonably good employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth and falling unemployment in recent years. Members observed that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfloating exchange rate and increasingly mobile labour and capital resources,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoupled with fiscal stabilisers, which provided a mechanism to redistribute\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effects of uneven growth among the states, were helping Australia as a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole to adapt to the terms of trade shock.

With construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalling, the stock of unsold new houses was being reduced, though it remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh. Overall growth in the economy had been good and resources in the economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained close to being fully employed. However, a key question for the Federal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReserve was whether the prospective slowing in growth would be uncomfortably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpronounced. While core capital goods orders had fallen sharply in recent months,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich implied softer business investment, corporate profits and rates of capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutilisation still remained high, which were supportive of continued growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin investment. Consumption had increased solidly over the year to February,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriven mainly by growth in spending on services, as spending on durable goods\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad grown more slowly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn all, GDP growth in the US was expected to slow from around 3¼ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2006 to 2¼ per cent in the current year. Despite the signs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof slowing in the economy, core inflation remained relatively high and had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tedged up in the past few months, which suggested that the decline in inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseen late last year may have been temporary. Slower growth in output would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe required to ease the inflation pressure in the economy, but the problems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the sub-prime mortgage market raised the possibility of a greater degree\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof slowing than desired. This left US monetary policy delicately poised at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent, with the Fed facing slightly higher inflation at the same time as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowing downside risks to the real economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to as yet unpublished IMP forecasts, world GDP growth was expected to slow\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom 5¼ per cent in 2006 to 4¾ per cent in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2007.

Retail sales, motor vehicle registrations\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand employment had all been solid in recent months. There were also signs of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan upturn in the housing market. The national accounts had until recently been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat odds with the more general run of data, but the stronger December quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfigures had brought them into line.

It was noted also that the US Fed had become\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tless convinced about the capacity of the economy to keep growing.

On the other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand, the uncertainty about the recent path of inflation and about the outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the US and global economies meant that it would be prudent to wait another\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth, to see the March quarter CPI and evaluate further the US outlook, before\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaking any decision to raise interest rates further.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "The Decision": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Board decided that the cash rate should remain at 6.25 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"]}},

GDP growth in the March quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been 0.3 per cent, broadly around the ½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarterly rate that had been recorded for the past year. As a result, year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was now 2.1 per cent. Domestic spending had also been running\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat a quarterly pace of around ½ per cent for the past year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich represented a slowing from the above-trend pace previously. The main\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriver of the slowing in growth had been housing construction. Excluding the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect of the housing slowdown, growth had remained at around 3 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich suggested reasonable strength in other sectors of the economy. Employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth had exhibited a similar pattern to that of GDP growth: it was slowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut so far had remained rapid enough to push down unemployment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the US housing sector, there was some evidence to suggest that the forward indicators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof construction, namely permits to build and starts, were bottoming out. These\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen by 30 per cent since the peak in early 2006 and the level\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof starts was now low enough for stocks of unsold dwellings to be eroded. Nevertheless,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven with no further falls in starts, housing activity was likely to be a restraining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfluence on GDP growth until the second half of the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn other parts of the world, growth remained strong. IMF and private-sector forecasts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere that the overall slowdown in 2007 would be mild and concentrated in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS. Growth was forecast to be around 5 per cent in 2007, down from 5½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin 2006.

Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the sustainable growth rate of the Chinese economy. This was difficult\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto measure as changes in internal labour migration patterns, in particular,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould lead to significant changes in resource availability and productivity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOther influences on China's potential growth were domestic absorption and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe capacity of other countries to absorb China's output, as well as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenvironmental implications of ongoing rapid industrialisation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere had been little new information on the Japanese economy, which had recorded\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseveral years of good growth. The Tankan business survey showed that business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions were currently above average and had continued to improve. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvey tracked GDP reasonably well. Bank lending growth appeared to have stabilised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat around 2 per cent per annum, which was relatively low.

Industrial production was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising by 4 per cent, which was the fastest rate since 2000. Consumer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand business sentiment had increased steadily over the past two years.

This was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first time this had been required since the current inflation-targeting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand accountability arrangements were introduced a decade ago.

Consumer sentiment up to April was back to levels seen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo or three years earlier. This series was volatile and only the low-frequency\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovements conveyed useful information.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLoan approvals as a share of housing credit outstanding were running at the low end\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the recent range, but had picked up in the past few months following a noticeable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowing during the second half of 2006. A similar pattern was evident in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonthly growth of housing credit, which indicated that the easing in the demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor finance had not persisted.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers discussed the sustainability of the current pace of overall household credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth, having considered this on several previous occasions. While they noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat recent growth rates had been relatively fast, they also noted that many\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother countries had been experiencing fast credit growth. They concluded that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstructural changes were taking place in the way that households managed their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial affairs, which made it difficult to judge what a sustainable rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof credit growth might be. They acknowledged that the increases in household\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebt that had taken place over the past decade had, at least to date, not caused\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany systemic financial stress in the household sector.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latest data on house prices indicated that prices in Sydney and Perth had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively flat in recent months and prices in other capital cities were rising\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmodestly. In Sydney, the flat picture for average house prices masked a widening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgap between prices at the upper end of the market, which were showing modest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgains, and prices in the cheapest suburbs, which were still declining. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that there had been an increase in repossessions in south-western Sydney,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough the aggregate figures were still low. A similar development, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a considerably lesser extent, had also occurred in parts of Melbourne.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn another indicator of activity in the secondary housing market, rising auction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne confirmed an improvement in conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin those parts of the market where auctions were prevalent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal credit growth was steady at about 15 per cent over the year to March.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking a longer perspective, over the past three years there had been a shift\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the growth of credit from households to businesses, and in the past year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor so growth in credit to businesses had exceeded growth in credit to households.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis reflected a trend towards higher gearing among businesses in a world that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad seen macroeconomic stability, low volatility and high returns to equity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor several years. It seemed that businesses were assuming that these conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould persist. Members expressed some concern about the possible wider economic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand financial implications should this assumption prove unwarranted, though\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey recognised that the developments they had observed were at an early stage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the potential dynamics of the private equity developments, in particular,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere difficult to assess.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to international trade, growth in import volumes was estimated to have remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong in the March quarter, exceeding 10 per cent on a year-ended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbasis, which reflected solid domestic demand. Export volumes had continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the mild uptrend seen over the past few years. Strong growth in export prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas estimated to have driven a further sharp rise in export values in the March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. The relatively modest growth in overall export volumes in the face\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof robust external demand was best understood by examining disaggregated data\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the resources component. Members noted that while iron ore and, to a lesser\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\textent, coal exports had increased rapidly in recent years, a trend decline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin oil exports, owing to the depletion of existing oil fields, had weighed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the figures for total resource exports.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodity prices had continued to rise in the past month. Over the past few years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall components of the base metals index had risen sharply; nickel prices had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased eightfold since 2003.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that the likely effect of the current drought was to reduce\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfarm GDP by 23 per cent in 2006/07. Assuming a return to normal seasonal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions in the following year, farm output was expected to bounce-back from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe lower level by 22 per cent, though of course these figures were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighly uncertain.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in the labour market had remained strong, with a further rise in employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin March and a decline in the unemployment rate to a generational low of 4.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CPI had increased by 0.1 per cent in the March quarter. A sharp fall in banana\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices subtracted significantly from the overall result. Underlying inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas assessed to have been about ½ per cent in the March quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand 2.7 per cent over the year, having eased from 3 per cent over the course\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof 2006. Members noted that the result for the quarter was lower than expected,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich meant that the two most recent quarterly readings on underlying inflation,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were both about ½ per cent, provided a signal that inflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures had eased since mid 2006. They were informed that there was no single\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfactor that could be identified as having caused the outcome to be lower than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected; rather, there appeared to have been a generalised pattern of moderating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice increases.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the outlook for inflation, members took account of wages growth running\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat about 4¼ per cent, adjusting for the changed timing of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe most recent minimum wage increase, and the fact that capacity utilisation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas currently at its highest level on record. They also noted that domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemand was increasing at a solid pace and labour resources were scarce, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested by the current low unemployment rate and indications from business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurveys that a lack of suitable labour was the most significant constraint\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton production. Some disinflation from the higher exchange rate was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the near term, but this effect was not likely to be large. While the assessment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas that underlying inflation could decline to around 2½ per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor possibly lower, in the short term, inflationary pressures were expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto re-emerge in 2008.

The source of the volatility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent weeks was different and, while not entirely clear, it appeared to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe related to three developments: the fall in the Chinese share market; concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the US sub-prime mortgage market; and the recent movements in the yen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe fall in the Chinese share market could not be traced to any particular event,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough it may have reflected concerns about measures, such as a capital gains\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttax, the authorities were contemplating to curb speculative excesses in asset\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets. The fall quickly spread to other markets and the associated increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin risk aversion in global financial markets had persisted since then. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the fall of 15 per cent in the Chinese market over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month needed to be seen in the context of a rise of 135 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the course of 2006.

This could be partly explained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the differential in population growth between NSW and these states, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe large overshooting in housing prices in NSW up until 2003 had also been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta factor.

Within the total, non-residential\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstruction was still growing strongly. While total business investment had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome off its peak share of GDP during 2006, it remained at a high level and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas thereby generating a high rate of growth in the capital stock.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrowth in housing credit had increased over the period to the middle of 2006.

Measurement issues may explain part of the slowdown, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was possible that recent GDP estimates might be revised up somewhat. Some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry-level explanations included developments in the mining and utilities\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsectors, but not all of these were easy to understand, and a large part of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe overall productivity slowdown could be traced to the non-market sector,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor which it was extremely difficult to measure productivity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAny genuine productivity slowdown that has occurred was likely to be related to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level of capacity utilisation in the economy, especially in the resources\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, which had seen a large increase in the price of its output in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears. Given that it often took time to put extra capacity in place, some firms\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay have chosen to meet increases in demand by taking on extra labour, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplied diminishing returns and lower labour productivity. However, these capacity-related\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects on productivity should be temporary, rather than permanent. It was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to place much weight on some other explanations, such as declining\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefits from information technology, which would suggest a more permanent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowdown, in part because they should be affecting productivity in other countries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat have not shared Australia's apparent productivity slowdown. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked the staff to extend their work to review the debate about productivity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the 1970s, to see if any lessons could be drawn.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking ahead, members agreed that some pick-up in productivity growth was likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the temporary restraints eased, but productivity growth would probably not\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn to the high rates seen earlier in the current expansion. Board members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the policy implications of the work that had been undertaken, noting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the uncertainties around estimates of trend productivity growth implied\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat significant attention needed to be placed on a range of direct measures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof resource utilisation and on price and wage pressures in particular. If the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrue rate of productivity growth was lower than previously believed, the rate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof wages growth that was consistent with meeting the inflation target would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe correspondingly lower.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers suggested publication of this work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recommendation to the Board was for no change in the cash rate in March.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe data that had become available over the past month suggested that economic conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taround the world had continued to be strong, with further indications that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth was spreading more evenly across the major economic regions. Domestically,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe main data pertaining to inflation came from the wage price index for the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember quarter.

The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslowdown in growth to 2 per cent was mainly due to the downturn in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe housing sector; excluding this sector, annual growth was a bit over 3 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was above trend and suggested that the performance of the other sectors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the US economy remained solid.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome indicators of housing activity in the US had shown signs of stabilising, following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe one-third fall in housing construction since the peak in late 2005 and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearly 2006.

Allowing for this effect suggested that the underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpace of wages growth had been slightly lower than expected. Wage rises associated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith enterprise bargains concluded in the March quarter were 4 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin total, with no change in the recent pace of growth of wages in the private\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand public sectors.

Key changes to wage-setting\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangements since the early 1990s had involved moving towards decentralised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twage-setting at the enterprise or individual level, away from a centralised\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem based on ‘comparative wage justice’.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOther important factors that had restrained wages growth over recent years had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher labour-force participation, better anchored price and wage expectations,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand product market deregulation, which had led to an increase in competition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the economy. However, it was difficult to determine the relative importance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof each of these factors in the overall picture. It was also difficult to assess\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe effect on wage outcomes and labour supply of recent legislative changes,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincluding the Work Choices legislation of 2006. Members noted that the phenomenon\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof modest wage pressures despite a tight labour market was also a feature of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic conditions in several other advanced economies at present, which suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat global developments associated with the international economic integration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof China and India had been important contributing factors. Taken together,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese factors had allowed the economy to grow more than would otherwise have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen possible without generating a significant lift in inflation.

In terms of monetary policy, the authorities had raised reserve requirements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsteadily over the past year and lifted lending and deposit rates. In addition,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere had been an increase in stamp duty on share trading, which appeared to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave been the proximate cause of the recent falls in share prices.

Growth in both aggregate and non-farm output had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen higher than expected. Following the strong outcome in the December quarter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand upward revisions to earlier periods, and a smaller fall in farm output\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the March quarter than had been expected, GDP growth over the year to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch quarter was 3.8 per cent.

The composition of spending had changed in the past two\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears; initially, investment had picked up as the pace of consumption and dwelling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivity had slowed but, more recently, these trends had started to reverse.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that, in the staff's judgment, part of the recent strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the national accounts was likely to be payback from weakness earlier in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2006 and that the pace of growth from the June quarter onwards would probably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tease. It was noted that the quarterly pattern of growth presented by the national\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccounts was subject to measurement error and subsequent revision, and that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past year or so these data may have exaggerated both the slowing and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen the pick-up in growth. Survey measures of business conditions and labour\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket data suggested that the pace of growth had varied by less than indicated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the national accounts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe stronger growth in output implied an increase in the rate of growth of productivity,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was measured at a little above 2 per cent over the year to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe March quarter, compared with the longer-run average of around 1¾ per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe higher rate of productivity growth was a consequence of the figures for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGDP growth and employment growth coming more into line, following a period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere employment growth had been considerably more rapid than output growth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at longer-run movements in productivity growth, members discussed the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible reasons for the higher growth in the second half of the 1990s relative\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto earlier periods. One explanation was the possibility that it had taken a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong time for the effects of the microeconomic reform measures that had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintroduced from the early 1980s to permeate through the economy and thereby\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshow up in data on activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the regular data releases over the past month, it was noted that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been no new retail sales figures following the modest increase reported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor April, though information from the Bank's liaison contacts had suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirm trading conditions recently.

Members commented that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas some doubt as to whether there was the capacity to increase housing construction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther given the demand on resources for non-residential construction, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas running at a high level, and by state government plans to increase public\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure spending.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse prices had increased in the past few months in all the capital cities except\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerth, where they had levelled out after rapid rises over the past few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increase in most cities was concentrated in the most expensive suburbs;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney, however, prices were rising only in suburbs in the middle of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice distribution, with the top end flat and prices in the cheapest suburbs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill flat or falling. There were some signs of increasing mortgage arrears,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich implied that the housing correction was continuing in some parts of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlargest cities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLooking at credit growth, while housing loan approvals and lending credit growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased a little in recent months, the rate for both series was below\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat seen in recent years. Business credit, on the other hand, was rising at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan annual rate of close to 20 per cent over the six months to May,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fastest in almost two decades. Members discussed whether it was appropriate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto characterise policy settings as ‘mildly restrictive’, agreeing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it was.

Although this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas well below the average rate of growth of 15 per cent in the previous\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfour years, the current share of investment in GDP was high and this implied\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth of the net capital stock of around 6 per cent per annum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the external sector, annual growth in export volumes was strong at about 7 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin all components in the March quarter except rural exports, which fell because\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the drought.

The widening in the net income deficit had arisen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause of higher interest payments on foreign debt and higher dividend transfers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabroad; as these payments were typically reinvested in Australia, they were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso recorded in the balance of payments statistics as inflows on the financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe terms of trade were estimated to have increased by about 2 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the June quarter, following a rise of 1 per cent in the March\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquarter. Base metals prices had fallen back in the past few months from very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh levels, with this mainly reflecting the trend in nickel prices.

The margin between WTI and Tapis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrude prices had widened a few months ago, reflecting refining capacity outages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US that had reduced the demand for WTI crude, though some of this was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the process of being reversed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRural output was expected to bounce back strongly in 2007/08, following the breaking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the drought.

Although the eastern states had benefited from widespread\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trainfall providing a good start to the winter cropping season, members commented\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the projections may be optimistic given the poor conditions in Western\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralia and the likely cut-backs to water allocations from the Murray-Darling\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabour market conditions were again strong in May.

Pending a review of the forecast for inflation to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundertaken following receipt of the June quarter CPI in late July, the outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas for underlying inflation to rise slightly towards 2¾ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the end of the forecast period.

As fixed-rate mortgages were more prevalent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan variable mortgage rates in that country, this had blunted the impact of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonetary policy, at least in relation to housing.

Prices of tradable items in the CPI had increased by 1 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the June quarter, having risen from the low point in 2003/04.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recent exchange rate appreciation was expected to reduce tradables inflation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto about zero, with this effect apparent over the next one to two years. On\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand, inflation among non-tradable items in the CPI, which was more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treflective of demand and capacity pressures, had been running around a 3½ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpace over the past few years and was expected to rise.

Business credit growth had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreased sharply over the past few months and, at 22 per cent on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta six-month-ended annualised basis, was now the fastest since the late 1980s.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers considered the pick-up in credit growth in the broader context of current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial conditions. Although the cash rate was noticeably above the average\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the past decade, the current level of interest rates facing borrowers was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacterised as mildly restrictive for new housing lending, being somewhat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the average level over the past decade, but about average for business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending on the same basis. Members observed that competition in business lending\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent years had led to a situation now in which there was very little spread\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween interest rates on business and housing loans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecently released census data had shown that home ownership had been relatively flat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the past two decades at a little over 70 per cent of households.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOwner-occupiers with housing debt represented about 35 per cent of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thouseholds. This proportion had fallen from the early 1980s to late 1990s,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut in recent years had risen again as households were holding on to debt for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger periods and taking advantage of loan redraw facilities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse prices had risen in all capital cities except Perth in the latest month, according\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto APM estimates based on transactions entered into in the first half of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear. Prices in Sydney had only recently begun to rise after a three-year period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring which they had declined. There were indications that prices in the top\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend of the Sydney and Melbourne markets in particular were firming, but those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the lowest-priced suburbs had been weaker. Also, auction clearance rates,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich tend to reflect activity in higher-priced suburbs, had picked up strongly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney and Melbourne since late last year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail sales had increased strongly in June after sales had fallen slightly in April\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand May.

In an indication of the tightness\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the labour market, the unemployment rate had been trending down over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast five years despite the upward trend in the participation rate.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall, members observed that the GDP data for the March quarter, which were discussed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the previous meeting, coupled with the latest readings from the labour force\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand business surveys were all consistent with a picture of considerable domestic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic strength.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "International Economic Conditions": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe outlook for the world economy had improved over recent months, although official\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforecasts were yet to reflect any assessment of the fallout from recent financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolatility. The latest quarterly forecasts from the IMF indicated upward revisions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor world growth, from 4.9 per cent to 5.2 per cent for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth 2007 and 2008.

While problems in the sub-prime market had been evident for some time,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latest bout of market volatility had arisen because the scale of leverage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand extent of exposure among financial institutions associated with sub-prime\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlending had become more apparent. Thus far, it appeared that the exposure to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsub-prime lending was spread fairly widely. The problems besetting Bear Stearns,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been covered at the previous meeting, had worsened further in recent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweeks. Australia had been home to a high-profile case of financial losses following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposure to the sub-prime market: a hedge fund, Basis Capital, had two funds,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had experienced large losses totalling around $650 million, causing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe funds to collapse.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed about the structure of the hedge fund sector in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was thought that most of the exposure to sub-prime loans had already surfaced,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas there were only a small number of funds whose predominant investment strategy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas fixed income. Most funds were of the ‘long-short equity’ variety.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, it was possible that some ‘fund of funds’ could have some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposure to sub-prime products, but these would be part of a diversified portfolio.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main risk of the fallout from the sub-prime problems related to the broad availability\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof credit, which by extension posed risks for activity in the US and other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomies. It was likely that more exposures would emerge as hedge funds around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe world would be forced to mark their positions to market, but as the market\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor these assets was not functioning, obtaining prices would be difficult.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis could create a high degree of discomfort for many investors and could\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadversely affect the ability of those with excessive leverage to ride out the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurrent period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA consequence of the recent developments was a widening of market spreads, most significantly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton low-rated corporate paper (junk bonds). It was important to note that while\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe price of debt had risen somewhat, there was also the important question\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the quantity of finance that would be forthcoming. Some high-profile mergers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand acquisitions had been withdrawn, which in themselves would not carry macroeconomic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplications, but of greater consequence was the risk of contagion, namely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe emergence of a generalised tightening of credit standards that could inhibit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe capacity of businesses to borrow for investment. In this context, members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoted that the proportion of US corporate debt that was sub-investment grade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas now higher than during previous episodes of financial stress. They discussed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe role of ratings agencies and possible regulatory issues that might arise\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the current environment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a consequence of recent financial turbulence, US bond yields had reversed their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise of the previous two months, and were back at 4.75 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYields had also fallen on other bond markets, including Australia. The fall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin government bond yields meant that, despite the rise in spreads, borrowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcosts for AAA-rated issuers had actually fallen in the past month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe turmoil in credit markets had spread to equity markets, which had also been volatile\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin recent weeks.

The Australian market had generally outperformed others and was 5 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher over the year to date, though had fallen by about 8 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince its peak in mid July. US financial sector stocks had seen their share\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices fall sharply and this had particularly been the case for sub-prime lenders.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial stocks overall were now back to their levels prevailing a year earlier.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, Macquarie Bank's share price had fallen in tandem with US\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial stocks, but it was still higher than a year earlier.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe problems in credit markets had seen an easing of monetary policy by the Fed again\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpriced in by the end of the year.

Since\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen, the exchange rate had risen back to around US86c and 68.5 on the trade-weighted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindex. In effective terms, the Australian dollar had been relatively flat over\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past month, though its deprecation against the yen and Swiss franc was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan indication of heightened risk aversion in global markets. The currency nonetheless\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained at a high level, and was 8 per cent higher on the TWI than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta year earlier.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFollowing release of the June quarter CPI, market expectations had moved to a high\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprobability of a tightening of monetary policy in Australia in August.

Increases in participation in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecent years had largely derived from older workers delaying retirement, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis could continue for some years given strong demand for labour and the fact\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Australia had a comparatively low participation rate among older cohorts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby international standards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recommendation to the Board was for an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints in August, to 6.5 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn discussing the recommendation to tighten monetary policy, Board members noted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the macroeconomic case was clear. The latest assessments of the outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the world economy had seen forecasts for the current and following year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevised upward. Domestically, recent economic data had signalled a pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the pace of demand and activity, which had been accompanied by higher-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderlying inflation, as indicated by the June quarter CPI. High rates of capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutilisation, ongoing reductions in unemployment and strength in the demand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor finance suggested that pressures on inflation would intensify over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod ahead. These pressures would be offset only slightly, and over an extended\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod, by the recent appreciation of the exchange rate. The forecast was that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderlying inflation on a year-ended basis would now rise to the top of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget band over the next six months and remain there subsequently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers gave careful consideration to the effect on the outlook for activity and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation in Australia of the recent events in financial markets, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin US credit markets. They noted that these developments were important and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould lead to a higher degree of risk aversion among investors, which would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpose downside risks to demand and output in the US economy if they persisted.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, these risks were more in the medium term and the extent to which they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould flow through to global growth, and ultimately to inflation in Australia,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas unclear. In any case, some slight dampening of the global growth outlook\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be tolerable given that continuing high commodity prices remained an\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant source of stimulus to incomes and spending in Australia.

However, yields on 90-day bankers'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacceptances, which had been around the same rate as fed funds for most of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, also rose sharply in early August and did not fall when the actual fed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunds rate fell; rates on bankers' acceptances remained about 25 basis points\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher during the month than their previous level, which represented an increase\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the cost of funds for banks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYields on asset-backed paper increased the most, by around 60 basis points, and some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of the market essentially shut down.

The difficulty the Fed had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin getting cash to flow to the institutions most in need, despite the actual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfed funds rate being well below target, led it on 17 August to cut the discount\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points above the fed funds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget rate. This action was designed to lessen the cost of emergency funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto around 7,000 banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System and have\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccess to the discount window. The Fed also lengthened the term of borrowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the discount window from typically overnight to 30 days and it signalled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it would consider accepting as collateral from banks the asset-backed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaper issued by their affiliated structured-finance vehicles (also known as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconduits).

However, expectations of a cut in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfed funds rate had risen, based in part on the statement accompanying the discount\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate cut in mid August, which pointed to a change in the balance of risks in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe real economy. Policy rates in Europe and Japan, which were previously seen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas likely to rise, were now expected to be left on hold, and this was the case\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor most countries.

Exchange settlement\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbalances, which financial institutions hold with the Bank, exceeded $5 billion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin late August, the highest level since the late 1990s and well above the usual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taverage level of around $700 million. More recently, the Bank had drained some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the excess cash from the system as conditions had stabilised a little. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBank's repurchase agreement (repo) operations had been largely in bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbills and certificates of deposit, rather than Commonwealth Government securities,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin an effort to alleviate pressures in the interbank funding market, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm of repos had tended to lengthen in the past month. These operations kept\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe actual cash rate in Australia firmly anchored to the target. Nevertheless,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trates on three-month funds, in particular those representing the cost of borrowing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffshore, rose sharply from early August. Consequently, banks turned back to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe domestic market for their funding, even though funding costs there were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso elevated.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers were informed that the Bank was contemplating further widening the pool of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollateral it would accept in repo operations given the funding problems currently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing experienced by some mid-tier Australian banks, whose funding was heavily\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcentrated offshore.

At the very least, discounts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton some housing loan products were likely to be reviewed. Such developments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif they occurred, would represent a de facto tightening of monetary policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was noteworthy that the recent turbulence in credit markets posed challenges\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor lenders, as profit margins had been squeezed, particularly for those reliant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton securitisation, where the US asset-backed commercial paper market was currently\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno longer a viable source of funding.

The stock of unsold houses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas being worked off, but this process had a long way to run and it was too\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoon to tell whether or not the cycle in new home sales had reached a trough.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse prices in the United States had begun to level out or were falling, according\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto three key measures.

Recent data for the Australian economy continued\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto suggest a robust pace of expansion, with output rising faster than trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand capacity utilisation and confidence high. However, downside risks to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited States economy had increased as a result of the ongoing weakness of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe housing sector there.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that there were stresses arising from the turbulence in global financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets as participants had struggled during recent weeks to re-price risk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the face of heightened uncertainty. Although these stresses were not always\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvisible to those not directly involved in credit markets, the economic effects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere potentially significant. Short-term wholesale funding costs for financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions had risen, including for Australian entities, and some segments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the capital markets were effectively closed. The higher cost of funding\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaced by these institutions, if sustained, would at some point be passed on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto indicator lending rates. In the absence of offsetting developments, this\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfactor, together with the heightened risk of slower world growth, would exert\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome additional restraint on demand, and hence inflation, in Australia.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the strength of the underlying economy was seen by members as possibly requiring\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta further monetary policy tightening to prevent inflation from rising above\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe target range, the financial developments over the past month could result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a tightening of financial conditions independently of movements in the cash\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate.

Bond issuance by corporates\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been minor, perhaps indicating that these borrowers were looking to their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbankers for funding, which would be consistent with the sharp growth in intermediated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness credit in recent months.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSince the August cash rate increase, it was estimated that banks' funding costs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad risen by an additional 15 basis points.

Key\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata on demand and activity and prices all pointed to the likelihood of stronger\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium-term inflationary pressures. According to the latest national accounts,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall components of demand, apart from housing investment, were increasing strongly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand economic activity had expanded at a pace well above average over the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto June.

In discussing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis outlook, members noted that strong investment was adding to productive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity and the appreciation of the exchange rate was likely to have a dampening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on prices. Nonetheless, if the recent pace of demand growth were sustained,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere would be further pressure on the economy's productive capacity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the labour market, intensifying inflationary pressures over the medium\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers took note that parts of the world economy had become weaker in recent months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand forecasts for the United States and other major industrial economies had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen lowered, partly reflecting the likely effects of the tightening of capital\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket conditions since August. However, world growth was still expected to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe above average in 2008, due to the growing importance of China and other\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerging economies. Ongoing rapid growth in China, in particular, was stimulating\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Australian economy, with the higher levels of commodity prices and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms of trade lifting domestic incomes and underpinning strong growth in spending.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs in previous months, credit market developments in Australia and overseas were\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan important element in the Board's deliberations.

The disruptions from the tightening\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin credit conditions in the United States and other major economies were expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto play out over a protracted period and the extent to which they would moderate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teconomic growth was uncertain. But the tightening of credit conditions in Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not been as pronounced as elsewhere and, in any event, local conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad improved in recent weeks.

Since July, when the previous set\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof forecasts was prepared, there had been a small downward revision to expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworld growth in 2008. The final forecast to be released this month may be a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbit lower again, with most of the adjustment likely to reflect a delay in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecovery of the US economy rather than any further slowing. Even with these\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdownward revisions, the forecast indicated that 2008 was expected to be the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsixth consecutive year of above average growth in the world economy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States economy had slowed to a 2 per cent per annum pace. Growth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas set to remain at that rate for the next few quarters as the expected pick-up\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin activity had been pushed out. The main source of weakness had been the housing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, which accounted for about 5 per cent of overall activity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe most recent figures for the leading indicators of housing activity had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued to fall, with no clear sign of a cyclical trough, which had previously\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen expected around mid year. In addition, house prices were falling, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Case-Shiller index of monthly repeat-sales, derived from sales of houses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the 20 largest cities, now 5 per cent below its peak in 2006.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers considered that a dynamic in the housing sector was at play, in which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople were reluctant to enter the market to build or purchase new homes so\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong as prices were falling. The stock of unsold new homes had peaked, but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fact the stock-to-sales ratio was still high suggested that a recovery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin housing construction was still some way off. Labour market conditions in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe United States had begun to soften in the past few months, with a fall in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-farm payrolls in August and downward revisions to the growth in payrolls\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the preceding two months. Nevertheless, employment growth over the past\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear had been 1.2 per cent, which was sufficient to keep the unemployment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate broadly stable over that period.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Japan, economic data had been volatile in recent months, making it difficult to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobtain a clear sense of the pace of growth. The latest Tankan survey on business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsentiment, conducted by the Bank of Japan, indicated that sentiment remained\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove average in the September quarter, but was below recent high levels. Overall,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit appeared that growth was reasonable but the momentum had slowed recently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployment growth was firm, at around 1½ per cent, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunemployment rate had been trending down. The CPI continued to fall by around\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t¼–½ per cent per annum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chinese economy had not showed any signs of slowing in the past few months. Industrial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction was increasing at more than 17 per cent a year. China\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow accounted for around 15 per cent of world GDP on a purchasing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower parity basis, about the same as for the euro area, and was the single\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlargest contributor to global GDP growth at present. Members noted that there\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere increasing limits to the continued rapid growth of the Chinese economy,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich bore watching. These included pollution, rapidly rising wages for middle\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanagement personnel and growing competition from other emerging Asian economies\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin manufacturing production.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers reviewed data on global steel production as an indicator of the importance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof China in the world economy. Crude steel production by China was rising by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t15 per cent per annum, with growth in steel production elsewhere\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the world flat. The share of China in world steel production was now approaching\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t40 per cent. Iron ore import volumes to China were also growing very\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly, with the share of China in total world iron ore imports around 45 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving been only a bit above 10 per cent a decade ago.

In aggregate across the region,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindustrial production was now growing at around 8 per cent, about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble the rate seen early in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tData on industrial production and consumer and business sentiment in the euro area\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that the pace of growth had eased but remained above average.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConditions in commodity markets suggested that strong global demand was continuing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespite the recent disruptions in credit markets in many countries. Base metals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprices had risen since early August and had doubled over the past three years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnly part of the latest rise could be attributed to the depreciation of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS dollar. Oil prices had reached record high levels in the past few weeks,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the prices of both WTI and Tapis crude above US$80 per barrel. Spot prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the bulk commodities of coal and iron ore, which are important Australian\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texports, had been strong, which suggested that the next round of contract price\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnegotiations could see increases.

Growth in the quarter had been ¼ percentage point higher than\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected, with no special factors to explain this. Apart from housing, all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomponents of demand were strong. Farm output fell by 26 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the June quarter, but this was expected to turn around in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe current financial year. GDP growth over the year was 4.3 per cent,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand non-farm growth of 5.2 per cent over the year was the highest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince 1998. Non-farm productivity growth was 2 per cent over the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear to the June quarter, and although a little slower than in the second half\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the 1990s, the data no longer raised the same puzzles that they had a year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was possible that the recorded increase in output growth overstated the true extent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof acceleration, following a period in 2005 and 2006 during which it had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplausibly low. But, in general, the current data consistently showed a picture\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof strong growth and suggested that this had continued into the September quarter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe NAB survey of business conditions, generally thought to be a reliable indicator\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof overall economic growth, had picked up over the past year, and early indications\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere that business conditions in the September quarter were as strong as at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany point since the start of the survey in 1989.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the national accounts, business investment had increased by 10 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the June quarter. The share of investment in GDP had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trising over the past several years, particularly for the buildings and structures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomponent, and was near the level seen in the late 1980s.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness credit had increased by more than 25 per cent over the six months\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto August on an annualised basis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to household spending and incomes, members noted that good growth in employment\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wages had led to strong growth in incomes, which in turn had spurred a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlift in the pace of retail sales, to around 7 per cent per annum.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe national accounts measure of real household disposable income had increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively strongly over the year to the June quarter. While interest payments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere increasing as a share of incomes, the annual growth of real disposable\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincome after interest payments was still very strong, at over 6 per cent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse prices were now picking up steadily across all cities, after being flat in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSydney up to the middle of the year. In Sydney and Melbourne, the rise in prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas mostly in the more expensive suburbs, especially so in Melbourne, but even\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Sydney the least expensive suburbs had seen prices stabilising after their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearlier falls. Auction clearance rates were significantly higher over the year\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto September in both Sydney and Melbourne, which post-dated the recent interest\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate increase and were consistent with a strong secondary housing market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was probably too early to expect to see any significant effects of the credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket disturbances on lending to households and businesses. August data for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousing loan approvals and housing credit showed that the spike in June, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas associated with superannuation-related investment activity, had been unwound\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the subsequent two months. This suggested that loan approvals and credit\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth were back on the same trends as before June, i.e. consistent with underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in housing credit of around 1 per cent per month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDwelling commencements up to the June quarter indicated that, on a national basis,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe downturn had been mild. In fact, the downturn had occurred mainly in NSW,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith commencements in other states being flat over the past four years. Members\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved it was unlikely that people would commit to build homes until they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere convinced prices had bottomed, and although demand for property by investors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas growing, rents may not yet have increased sufficiently to provide an attractive\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn on newly constructed accommodation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the rural sector, the lack of follow-up rainfall over winter had led to downward\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevisions to the recovery in farm output in 2007/08. ABARE had released its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember quarter outlook, which included a halving in the forecast recovery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin wheat production. Members noted that further downward revisions were likely\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the months ahead. As an indicator of tightening conditions in the grains\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket, wheat prices had risen very sharply in the past few weeks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe labour market had continued to be strong in August, with employment continuing\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto increase at a year-ended rate of 2½–3 per cent. Further\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases in job vacancies had confirmed the tightness of the labour market.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers recalled that the wage price index had risen by 4 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the year to the June quarter, which indicated no acceleration in wages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe national accounts measure of average earnings per head had increased by\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5½ per cent over the same period, though this series was volatile.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRevised GDP and inflation forecasts prepared for this meeting were similar to those\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresented at the previous meeting, but took account of the higher-than-expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth in the June quarter national accounts. The forecasts incorporated some\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural slowing in growth from the recent unusually fast pace, which would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe intensified by the dampening effect of the tightening of monetary policy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin August and recent problems in credit markets. World growth was expected\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be ½ percentage point lower, following the credit market disturbances,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand growth in Australia was expected to settle at around 3¼ per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tper annum over the forecast period, which was about trend. Inflation in underlying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterms was expected to settle just under 3 per cent, with the headline\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate gravitating towards that rate by the end of 2008. The staff view was that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif credit markets calmed down relatively quickly, there could be upside risks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto both the output and inflation forecasts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Financial Markets": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial strains had continued during September but lessened noticeably following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe reduction in the federal funds rate of 50 basis points announced by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFederal Reserve on 18 September.

Bond issuance, particularly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby financial institutions, had picked up considerably in late August and into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember, with yields generally higher than they had been before the crisis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Australia, spreads on short-term interest rates had begun to narrow from the peaks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treached in September, and to a greater extent than seen in other developed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries. Bank bill spreads remained above the levels prevailing prior to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe onset of the financial turmoil, in part the result of a shift from offshore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto onshore financing, which was easier and cheaper to accomplish in current\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket circumstances.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe financial market disruption had seen a marked change in global policy rate expectations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn part, the disruption had delivered a tightening in credit conditions that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome central banks had otherwise been intending to effect through increases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin policy rates. The market now expected the European Central Bank to remain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton hold rather than tighten policy further, and policy interest rates in Japan\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not expected to be raised any time soon. As noted, further easing was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected in the United States. The Bank of England was now expected to ease\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than tighten further.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe People's Bank of China had tightened monetary policy settings further during\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe past month. There had been no change to exchange rate arrangements, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe slow rate of appreciation continuing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGovernment bond yields in the major countries had increased from their recent lows,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing safe-haven buying by investors during August, and had returned to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe range that they had traded in for the past few years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe yield curve in the United States had not changed at the longer end following\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cut in the federal funds rate, unlike in the easing episode in 2001, where\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger-term rates fell significantly and generated an easing in conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor borrowers on fixed-rate mortgages. The current yield curve implied that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe market was expecting stabilisation in the economy with the possibility\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof rising inflation down the track. These movements had not generated much\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasing for those on fixed-term mortgages. Those on adjustable-rate mortgages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere better off, but many borrowers faced resets in the period ahead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare markets around the world rose strongly during September, particularly in Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand emerging markets. However, stocks of financial institutions remained well\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow their peaks. Several US financial institutions had recently reported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthird-quarter earnings, and most had reported losses associated with activity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the US sub-prime and related markets. Despite the losses, some profit reports\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still quite strong.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian share market had outperformed other markets over the past month and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas back at record high levels. Resource stocks had been very strong and local\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial institutions had not been marked down as much as those in the United\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn foreign exchange markets, the US dollar had continued to decline and carry trades\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been re-instated, which had favoured high-yielding currencies and prevented\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther appreciation of the yen against the US dollar. The euro was at an all-time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh against the US dollar and the Canadian dollar had gone through parity;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe US trade-weighted exchange rate had reached a record low. The strength\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the pound sterling had been crimped by the effects of the Northern Rock\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrisis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Australian dollar had surged higher in September, after falling sharply during\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust, as the risk appetite of investors had returned. The current level of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe exchange rate against the US dollar was just below the peak in February\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1989. The most recent appreciation had pushed the exchange rate more than 12 per cent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher over the past year on a trade-weighted basis, and the Australian dollar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad increased against all the currencies in the trade-weighted basket.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTurning to the domestic money market, members noted that Australian banks had been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswitching funding sources from offshore to onshore. After a very weak period\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring August and early September, bond issuance had started to pick up more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently. Bond issues by some domestic financials had been oversubscribed but\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspreads were higher than in the past few years; similar trends were in evidence\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor residential mortgage backed securities.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese higher funding costs were being passed through to interest rates on business\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloans, which tended to be priced off bank bill rates and had risen by about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t25 basis points. However, the major banks were benefiting from an increased\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflow of deposits, which contained the rise in average funding costs. This\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad allowed the majors to leave prime indicator housing rates unchanged and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease rates only on low-doc and non-conforming loans. Some of the non-bank\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlenders had announced increases in interest rates on loans of 10–15 basis\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn relation to monetary policy, market expectations were for only a one-in-three\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchance of further tightening in Australia in coming months, but were higher\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor next year. Members noted that the September quarter CPI, which was scheduled\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor release later in the month, could change these expectations.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>"], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recommendation to the Board was for no change to the cash rate in October.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn discussing the recommendation, Board members observed that the US economy appeared\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be facing a more prolonged period of soft growth than had previously been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected and that the credit market disruptions could have a noticeable adverse\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect on both the US and the euro-area economies in the period ahead. Conditions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the Australian economy had been very strong this year and the outlook was\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor further robust growth, with underlying inflation remaining at an uncomfortably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh level. High global commodity prices, and the prospect of further increases\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin prices for some important export commodities, were continuing to stimulate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic demand and increase incomes. This would be likely to add to inflationary\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressures over the medium term, though the recent appreciation of the exchange\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\trate would exert some dampening effect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that the stresses arising from the turbulence in global financial markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeared to have eased somewhat over the past month, but nonetheless markets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained fragile and uncertain. More significant losses among overseas financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions were likely to emerge, which could dent confidence. The extent\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto which global credit conditions had tightened as a result of recent developments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not yet clear, but emerging economies such as China were likely to be less\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffected than the larger developed economies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers noted that a <em lang=\"la\">prima facie</em> case to tighten policy further could be argued,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbased on the inflation risks from the strong momentum of the domestic economy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand despite the slowing in the United States. However, the state of financial\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets, while improving over the month, remained uncertain, which suggested\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaution in policy-setting. The potential effects of recent financial developments\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the prospects for growth and inflation around the world and in Australia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould become clearer over the coming month.
