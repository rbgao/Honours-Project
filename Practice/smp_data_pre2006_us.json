Business and consumer confidence are at high levels, and there has been some scaling back in the year to date of the excesses in the housing market that had threatened to disrupt the economy last year. The economy has benefited from a generally favourable international environment and rising commodity prices. The sharp rise in oil prices over recent months has emerged as a possible dampening factor for global growth, but the effects at this stage are difficult to predict. ", " For the international economy, the current year has been a period of further recovery, though growth has eased from its rapid pace earlier in the year. The recovery in the United States, now entering its fourth year, appears well entrenched. Business investment and consumer spending are continuing to expand strongly and business confidence remains relatively high. Employment is increasing at a steady pace, though not as rapidly as earlier in the year. Other parts of the global economy continue to experience generally strong conditions. In Japan, business surveys report that conditions improved further in the September quarter to be at around their best in a decade. The Chinese economy is expanding rapidly and has become an important driver of overall global growth. Despite a modest slowing since the start of the year, the Chinese authorities remain concerned that the economy is in an overheated condition, and this prompted a rise in official interest rates in October to supplement the earlier tightening in credit controls. Growth in the smaller east Asian economies has been strong over the past year, though the pace appears to have eased recently, while the euro area is continuing its gradual recovery. ", " An important feature of the current economic upswing is that it has been associated with broadly based increases in commodity prices. At the global level, attention has focused particularly on the rise in oil prices and the possible impact this might have on global economic performance. The rise in oil prices has been, to a significant degree, a consequence of global economic strength rather than of disruptions to supply, though supply factors have clearly also played a part. It is to be expected that the rise in oil prices will dampen growth of the global economy and boost consumer prices relative to what would otherwise have been the case, but the size of these effects will depend importantly on the extent to which the recent increases are sustained. ", " While the rise in oil prices this year has attracted the greatest attention, there have also been strong price increases for a wide range of other mineral commodities. The RBA base metals index, for example, has increased by almost 30 per cent in foreign currency terms over the past year, and there have been substantial increases in coal and iron ore prices. For a commodity exporter such as Australia this represents a significant boost to the terms of trade and is thus providing a stimulus to incomes and spending. As discussed below, rising commodity prices have also begun to put some upward pressure on prices more broadly. ", " Financial markets have generally taken the view that the negative impact of rising oil prices on global economic activity will more than outweigh any inflationary impact. Thus rising oil prices over recent months have resulted in falling bond yields and reduced expectations of monetary tightening. Yields on 10-year bonds in the US have fallen back to around 4 per cent, a decline of about 70 basis points since mid year, and similar movements have occurred in bond markets in other countries. This is an unusual development against the background of early-cycle rises in official interest rates. Rising oil prices have also contributed to a lacklustre performance by the US share market, which has shown little net change since the start of 2004 despite strong economic growth in the US. Reflecting the overall negative sentiment in US financial markets, the US dollar has resumed the depreciating trend that began in early 2002. ", " In Australia, while the yield curve has flattened in line with developments in international markets, other financial prices have suggested a more buoyant sentiment. In particular, the Australian share market remains very strong, significantly outperforming those in other countries this year, and the Australian dollar has risen substantially over recent months. A common theme affecting both the share market and the exchange rate has been the strength in global commodity markets. Other economies with heavy exposures to commodities – Canada, New Zealand and South Africa – are also doing well and their currencies have also risen more than most against the US dollar. ", " The most recent economic data in Australia indicate that the economy is continuing to perform strongly. Business surveys have generally reported above-average conditions in the September quarter, in some cases suggesting that conditions were close to their best in a decade. Similarly, consumer confidence has been at near-record levels for the past four months. Retail sales figures, although unexpectedly soft in July and August, picked up in September, and it is likely that household spending is continuing to be boosted by the tax cuts and increased benefit payments announced in the May Budget. ", " Conditions in the labour market are also firm. Employment increased strongly in September, following some softer figures in the previous three months, with the unemployment rate remaining around 5½ per cent. Looking through the recent monthly volatility, labour market conditions continue to reflect a strongly growing economy, with employment having grown by 2.5 per cent over the past year. The bulk of this increase has been accounted for by full-time jobs. Prospects for further employment growth appear to be good, with business surveys suggesting that hiring intentions are at high levels. ", " The overall growth of the economy has remained highly dependent on domestic demand, with the expected recovery in exports slow to develop. While rural and services exports have picked up over the past year, capacity constraints have continued to hamper exports from the resources sector. However, strong growth in investment in that sector over the past couple of years should see significant additional productive capacity starting to come on stream over the year ahead. At the same time, as noted above, the economy is benefiting from sharp increases in commodity export prices, and this has contributed to the growth in domestic incomes and spending. ", " Inflation in Australia remains relatively low, though signs of upward pressure are now beginning to emerge in some areas. CPI inflation was 2.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter, down marginally from the previous quarter, with most underlying measures running slightly below the headline figure. In addition, despite reports of shortages of labour, aggregate wages growth remains under control at this stage. Over the past couple of years, the trend in underlying inflation has been one of gradual decline, reflecting the lagged impact of the exchange rate appreciation that took place during 2002 and 2003. However, this trend appears now to have largely run its course, and underlying inflation is likely to start rising next year as the impact of the earlier appreciation fades. Inflation in the non-tradables sector of the economy remains relatively high, though it has eased recently as a result of a slowing in housing construction costs. Producer price figures for the September quarter were higher than expected, with rising global commodity prices contributing significantly to upstream price increases. ", " Currently it is expected that underlying inflation will rise gradually to around 2½ per cent by the end of 2005 and slightly higher by mid 2006. Headline CPI inflation will remain higher than underlying measures in the coming year, reflecting the effect of higher petrol prices. While this outlook is similar to that presented in the August <em>Statement</em>, it is apparent that the trough in inflation will not be as low as had been expected at the beginning of the year, when both headline and underlying measures had been forecast to decline to a trough of 1½ per cent by the end of this year. In part this upward revision has reflected the lower exchange rate prevailing over much of the period since then. ", " Developments in credit and housing markets point to a continuation of the adjustment apparent since the early part of the year. Available data for house prices in the September quarter have again indicated flat or declining prices in most cities and at the national aggregate level. The adjustment to date has been an orderly one, so that the risk of an uncomfortably sharp decline in house prices does not appear to be large, though equally there does not appear much risk of a renewed upsurge at present. In addition to this adjustment occurring in the housing market, there has been a welcome slowing in household credit in recent months, following the earlier declines in loan approvals. ", " In summary, then, the information becoming available over recent months has continued to indicate a favourable combination of circumstances for the Australian economy. In particular, while business conditions have remained strong, inflation declined further in the September quarter and wage increases at an aggregate level have been well contained. Although financial conditions remain moderately accommodative, the excesses in house price inflation and household borrowing that were apparent last year have been reduced, with a consequent easing of the risk of disruption to the economy from those sources. In these circumstances the Board did not see a case for monetary policy to be tightened when it reviewed the policy setting at its three most recent monthly meetings. In light of the economic data becoming available during this period, the Board's decisions to hold the cash rate unchanged were well anticipated and provoked no reaction in financial markets. ", " Looking ahead, the international economic environment is likely to remain supportive of growth in Australia, with the global recovery well established and strong commodity prices providing a firm underpinning to the Australian economy. Although inflation in Australia is relatively low at present, it is expected to begin rising gradually next year, and the recent strength in upstream price pressures is consistent with this outlook. Accordingly, while there is no pressing need for higher interest rates at this stage, it continues to appear likely that the economy will require higher interest rates at some stage of the current expansion. The Board will continue to monitor developments and to make such adjustments to policy as may be required to promote sustainable growth of the economy with low inflation. ", " Conditions in the international economy remain generally favourable, and growth is becoming more broad-based geographically. The global expansion is continuing, although the pace of growth has moderated from the very rapid rates seen in the second half of 2003 and start of 2004. This has been most evident in the United States and Japan. The economies of east Asia continue to enjoy strong growth and the recovery in the euro area has become more firmly established. Strong growth is also evident in the emerging economies of Latin America and eastern Europe. Oil prices are at high levels, but this has not yet prompted any significant revisions to growth forecasts. In its latest assessment of the international outlook, the IMF forecasts that world GDP will grow by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.0 per cent</span> in 2004, which would be the fastest rate of growth in nearly 30 years (Graph 1, Table 1). World GDP growth is then expected to ease to 4.3 per cent in 2005, largely reflecting the return to more normal rates of growth in the US and Japan. Persistently high world oil prices would, however, be likely to see downward revisions to growth forecasts for 2005. ", " In light of this strong global growth, central banks around the world have continued the process of removing some of their earlier policy stimulus. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, Bank of Canada and a number of other central banks have lifted their policy rates in the past three months. The European Central Bank and <span class=\"no-wrap\">Bank of Japan</span> have again been notable exceptions, leaving rates unchanged in response to the more modest recovery underway in those countries. ", " After experiencing a patch of softer growth around mid year, the US economy has picked up in recent months. Real GDP grew by 0.9 per cent in the September quarter to be 3.9 per cent higher in year-ended terms <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 2)</span>. The stronger September quarter result largely reflected a rebound in consumption growth after a lull in the June quarter; business investment continues to expand strongly. ", " Recent employment data have generally been disappointing, but most other indicators point to a brighter outlook for the labour market. Non-farm payrolls have posted only modest gains since June, after rising strongly in the first five months of the year (Graph 3). The string of hurricanes that hit the US in August and September appears to have had a temporary downward influence on payrolls. The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.3 per cent</span> in mid 2003 to 5.4 per cent in September, but this decline can be partly attributed to a falling participation rate. Other indicators of the labour market are generally quite positive, consistent with the healthy pace of GDP growth. Initial jobless claims are running at around 340,000 per week – a level usually commensurate with monthly payroll gains of roughly 150,000–200,000. Strong growth in temporary-help services jobs, which in the past has been a reliable predictor of payroll employment, suggests near-term increases in employment of a similar magnitude in coming months. The employment indices from both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISM surveys are at high levels, which would normally be consistent with monthly payroll gains of around 200,000, or a little above. ", " Consumption grew by 1.1 per cent in the September quarter, up from the 0.4 per cent growth recorded in the June quarter, to be 3.5 per cent higher over the year. Growth in household net wealth slowed slightly over the June quarter, but over the year it has been a strong 11 per cent. The recovery in employment should underpin further solid growth in household spending. Against this, consumer sentiment has recently weakened, possibly due to the run-up in oil prices, after having registered solid gains over the year to mid 2004. Following strong activity in the housing sector in recent years, growth in residential investment slowed in the September quarter, but it remains around 8½ per cent higher over the year, supported by low long-term fixed mortgage rates. Leading indicators of activity, such as housing starts and approvals, appear to have reached a plateau, although builders' confidence is at a high level. ", " Conditions in the business sector remain positive. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISM indices have come off their recent highs, but remain at expansionary levels (Graph 4). Business investment grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.8 per cent</span> in the September quarter, to be up by nearly 10 per cent over the year. The growth over the past year has largely reflected increased equipment investment, although non-residential construction investment grew for the second successive quarter, after declining for much of the previous few years. Core capital goods orders, which are a timely indicator of equipment investment, are growing at an annual pace of around 10 per cent. Financing conditions remain very supportive of investment growth; in particular, corporate profits grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">19 per cent</span> over the year to the June quarter and are quite high relative to GDP. Corporate gearing continues to decline and interest rates for corporate borrowing remain very low, even though the Fed funds rate is now rising. Firms may also be bringing forward some capital spending in order to take advantage of accelerated depreciation allowances that expire at the end of the year. ", " After a noticeable pick-up in inflationary pressures in the first five months of the year, core CPI inflation has been a little more subdued recently, and was 2.0 per cent over the year to September. The effect of crude oil price increases on headline inflation has been surprisingly modest in recent months, with year-ended headline inflation actually easing from 3.3 per cent in June to 2.5 per cent in September. There are still signs of significant upstream price pressures; the prices-paid indices from both of the ISM surveys are at high levels. With the US economy firmly on an expansionary path, the Federal Reserve has continued the process of returning interest rates to more normal levels, raising the funds rate by 25 basis points in both August and September to 1.75 per cent. ", " The Japanese economy continues to recover, though growth has moderated from the rapid pace recorded around the start of the year. Following two very strong quarters, real GDP expanded by 0.3 per cent in the June quarter, to be 4.3 per cent higher over the year. The extent of the fall in the deflator is probably overstated, which might be boosting measured real GDP; nominal GDP grew by a more modest 1.4 per cent over the year to the June quarter (Graph 5). ", " Having made significant progress in mending its balance sheet, the Japanese corporate sector appears in much better health than it has been in for many years. Corporate profits rose by 6.5 per cent in the June quarter and by 33 per cent over the year. This healthy cash flow points to further strength in investment (Graph 6). It has also enabled firms to repay their outstanding debts, with corporate debt (as a share of GDP) falling to levels not seen since the late 1980s. Consistent with this, business conditions, as reported by the Tankan and Shoko Chukin surveys, have improved to decade-high levels, with the manufacturing sector generally outperforming the services sector. On the other hand, indicators of corporate activity such as industrial production, machinery orders and merchandise exports point to some easing of growth since the start of the year. Much of this can be attributed to developments in the ITC sector, where inventories have risen significantly in recent months, suggesting the beginnings of a downturn in the sector. ", " The outlook for the labour market remains relatively upbeat. Despite some recent volatility, the unemployment rate has been on a downward trend and stood at 4.6 per cent in September, down from 5½ per cent in early 2003. A shrinking labour force, associated with an aging population, has driven some of the fall, but employment has also picked up over the past year, as reported in both the household and payrolls surveys. Forward-looking indicators, such as surveyed hiring intentions and the ratio of job offers to applicants, also point to further gains in the near term. ", " Data on the household sector have been more mixed, but on balance remain positive. With employment prospects improving, consumer sentiment has risen to its highest level since the early 1990s, while indicators of consumer spending, such as retail sales and consumer goods shipments, have generally been trending upwards in recent months. However, cash wage earnings continue to fall in year-ended terms, held down partly by fairly weak summer bonuses, and weigh on the outlook for household spending. ", " Consistent with the upswing in activity, deflationary pressures continue to ease, though falling prices are likely to persist for some time yet as there remains considerable spare capacity in the economy. Core consumer prices were flat over the year to September, compared with deflation rates of around 1 per cent in the past few years. Reflecting the run-up in world commodity prices, domestic corporate goods prices have increased by 1.8 per cent over the year to September – the fastest rate of increase since 1991. ", " There has been a modest slowing in growth in the Chinese economy in recent months as government measures aimed at curbing over-investment in certain sectors and reducing credit and money growth have taken effect. The authorities tightened monetary policy in late October, on concerns that investment growth is still very strong. Growth in China continues to run well ahead of that seen in most other countries. ", " Compared with year-ended rates in excess of 9½ per cent in recent quarters, China's real GDP rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">9.1 per cent</span> over the year to the September quarter. The slowdown was most pronounced in the sectors that have been targeted by the authorities. Growth in fixed-asset investment came down to around 28 per cent over the year to September, from more than 50 per cent at the start of the year. Growth in credit and the money supply has also slowed roughly in line with the official targets for 2004. In contrast, there has been only a gentle slowing in growth in industrial production, which eased to 16.1 per cent over the year to September from a peak of 19.4 per cent in March (Graph 7). Growth in trade has also moderated over recent months, but remains strong. The value of merchandise exports increased by around 33 per cent over the year to September, with imports <span class=\"no-wrap\">21 per cent</span> higher over the same period. Household expenditure remains buoyant, with retail sales continuing to grow rapidly, underpinned by rising per capita incomes. ", " Consumer price inflation has risen, to 5.2 per cent over the year to September, close to its highest rate in over seven years. Food prices continue to be the main driver of inflation, rising by 13 per cent over the year to September, but this upward pressure appears to be easing as domestic supply expands. Excluding food, consumer prices generally remain contained, though some pressure on housing costs has emerged recently; this component of the CPI was 6.4 per cent higher over the year to September. ", " Growth in the rest of east Asia has also slowed somewhat from its earlier rapid pace, although it remains reasonably firm. In aggregate, GDP increased by a little more than 7 per cent over the year to June, although this figure was boosted by the rebound from the SARS-related weakness mid last year. In the quarter, growth eased in line with developments elsewhere in the world (Table 2). Domestic demand is picking up in most countries in the region, underpinned by improving labour markets and still-stimulatory macroeconomic policies. Korea is still an exception, with domestic demand remaining weak amid little sign of a turnaround in household consumption. High oil prices are likely to weigh on growth in east Asia more than elsewhere, because its economy is a relatively intense user of oil, almost all of which is imported. Of course, strong growth in east Asia has also been one of the key factors pushing up oil prices. ", " Export growth slowed in the June quarter, and recent indicators suggest that this trend has continued. Annual growth in merchandise exports has slowed from 29 per cent over the year to May to 23 per cent over the year to September, and is expected to moderate further in conjunction with the easing in Chinese growth. In addition, signs are emerging that the global upswing in ITC demand, which has been a significant driver of the region's export growth, may have peaked. Industrial production has also levelled off recently, to be 8 per cent higher over the year to August, down from 14 per cent in May (Graph 8). ", " In contrast, the outlook for domestic demand remains favourable; interest rates are low, capacity utilisation rates are high and the labour markets in the region are improving. Activity in Taiwan and Hong Kong should also receive a boost from rising asset prices following a prolonged period of deflation. Korea is the main exception to this outlook; domestic activity continues to be constrained by weak consumption, which declined again in the June quarter – its third successive quarterly contraction – to be 0.6 per cent lower over the year and 2.9 per cent below its peak in late 2002. Korea's monthly retail and wholesale sales also show little sign of a pick-up, with the labour market worsening recently and consumer confidence remaining depressed. ", " There has been a noticeable increase in consumer price inflation across much of east Asia in recent months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 9)</span>. This appears to be largely due to higher food and energy prices, with underlying measures of inflation showing more modest rates of increase. However, there are signs that upstream price pressures are building amidst strong economic growth, and most central banks in the region have tightened monetary policy. <span class=\"no-wrap\">The Bank of Korea</span>, in contrast, cut its policy rate by 25 basis points in August to 3.5 per cent in order to stimulate domestic activity. ", " Growth in the Indian economy slowed in the first half of 2004 but remains healthy; over the year to the June quarter, real GDP increased by 7.3 per cent, down from more than 10 per cent over 2003. Industrial production continues to grow strongly, rising by 7.8 per cent over the year to August, and exports are up by 17.4 per cent over the year to September, although they have been broadly flat recently. A poor monsoon season is likely to constrain agricultural production in the period ahead. Inflation has increased noticeably in the past few months; the wholesale price index, the preferred inflation indicator in India, was up by 7.4 per cent over the year to September. In response, the Reserve Bank of India tightened monetary policy in late October. ", " The euro area recovery appears to be gaining momentum, although it is geographically uneven and still highly reliant on external demand. Euro area GDP grew by 0.5 per cent in the June quarter, to be 2.0 per cent higher over the year. The increase was almost entirely due to growth in net exports, with consumption and investment remaining weak. The stimulus to consumption from tax cuts at the beginning of the year appears not to have carried over into the June quarter. The share of investment in GDP has fallen to its lowest level in 15 years. ", " The pattern of growth varies considerably across euro area countries (Graph 10). Among the larger countries, France has been growing at the fastest pace, driven by strength in domestic demand and wealth effects from rising house prices. In Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, domestic demand remains sluggish and recent growth has been dependent on net exports. In Germany, consumer spending appears to have been restrained by uncertainty surrounding proposed welfare reforms, and investment remains weak despite a pick-up in corporate profitability. Germany's tight credit conditions may also be discouraging investment spending. ", " More timely indicators suggest that the euro area's modest recovery should continue. Extra-regional merchandise exports grew by 9.4 per cent over the year to August. On the back of this external demand, euro-wide industrial production has been growing fairly steadily, at an annual rate of around 2 per cent in recent months. Business sentiment in the area has continued to edge higher and is now above long-run average levels (Graph 11), although German business confidence has weakened recently on concerns about the continued lack of domestic demand. ", " The recovery in consumer sentiment over the past year has been more modest, and sentiment remains below average levels. Lacklustre labour market outcomes and reform-related uncertainty have constrained confidence and spending. The euro-wide unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 9.0 per cent and shows little sign of improvement in the near term. Retail sales have been broadly unchanged of late. ", " Continued upward pressure from energy prices has kept overall inflation above the ECB's 2 per cent reference rate since May, although underlying measures of inflation have remained around 2 per cent. The impact of energy prices has been more pronounced in producer price inflation, which climbed to 3.1 per cent over the year to August. Year-ended growth in labour costs has continued to ease, reaching 2.2 per cent over the year to the June quarter, consistent with the subdued labour market. The ECB has held its policy rate unchanged at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> since June 2003. ", " After growing at a stronger-than-expected 0.9 per cent in the June quarter, the UK's GDP expanded by a moderate 0.4 per cent in the September quarter, to be 3 per cent higher over the year. More recent data suggest slower growth than the above-trend pace of the past year. Merchandise exports were broadly flat in the three months to August, hampered by soft demand from the euro area. Manufacturing production fell in September for the third consecutive month, although this outcome was somewhat at odds with the relatively upbeat business surveys. ", " Consumer confidence is also high, and labour market conditions remain tight; according to the Labour Force Survey, the unemployment rate has fallen to an historically low 4.7 per cent. In the past few years consumer spending has received a significant fillip from rising house prices, but recent data suggest some cooling in the market. According to the Nationwide and Halifax surveys, there was a marked slowing in house price growth in the past three months, although prices remain well above levels of a year ago (Graph 12). The value of housing loan approvals has dropped sharply from its peak in September last year. Despite the strength of economic activity since the middle of 2003, inflation has remained well below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target, and was <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.1 per cent</span> over the year to September. The Bank of England raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.75 per cent</span> in August. ", " Oil prices increased sharply over the three months to October, before reversing somewhat in early November. Global production capacity has continued to be stretched by strong demand, and short-term disruptions to supply have compounded the pressures on prices. Prices averaged just above US$53 per barrel in October, which is the highest nominal price on record, and around 75 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 13). However, in real terms they remain well below the levels observed following the second OPEC oil shock of late 1979, and the recent rate of increase has been much less pronounced than during that episode. ", " According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), expectations of oil demand in 2004 have been steadily revised up over the course of the year, to 82.4 million barrels per day (bpd), a 5.8 per cent increase in demand from two years ago. Global demand has been especially boosted by higher demand from China, which has risen by 1.3 million bpd, or 26 per cent over the past two years. With no similar expansion in global supply capacity, the amount of spare capacity has fallen to very low levels. ", " Potential and realised disruptions to short-term supply have exacerbated these trends, placing additional upward pressure on prices. Sabotage to oil infrastructure in Iraq has led to ongoing supply disruptions, while concerns remain over the outlook for production at Yukos, a Russian oil firm that is in danger of bankruptcy. Also, Hurricane Ivan recently disrupted production in the US, while labour unrest and threats from rebel militia have placed some doubt over the stability of oil supply from Nigeria. Some market analysts have estimated that these short-term supply problems, plus the current low level of commercial stocks of oil, have contributed to a risk premium of at least US$10 per barrel in prices. ", " Many central banks around the world have begun the process of unwinding the very accommodative settings of monetary policy that have been in place over the past couple of years. The tightening process thus far has been very gradual, and two major central banks, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, have yet to commence. ", " The US Federal Reserve has continued on the path begun in June, raising the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of its two meetings since the last <em>Statement</em>, to the current level of 1.75 per cent (Graph 14). Like the June move, the two most recent interest rate increases were widely anticipated and had little impact on financial markets. The federal funds futures market is expecting the Fed to raise rates by a further 25 basis points at the November meeting, before pausing in December. Beyond that, markets are expecting a slower pace of tightening, in part reflecting their assessment that the contractionary effect on growth of the large rise in oil prices will outweigh the inflationary impact in the medium term. Futures markets are currently pricing in only a <span class=\"no-wrap\">further 50 basis points</span> increase in the federal funds rate by mid 2005 which, if realised, would still leave short-term rates at an historically low level. ", " Financial markets still do not expect a shift in monetary policy in either the euro area or Japan until well into 2005. The European Central Bank has stated that it is comfortable that the economy is recovering gradually, although it is concerned about the effect of higher oil prices. The Bank of Japan's recently released inflation forecasts imply that an exit from its quantitative easing framework remains some way off given its position that this would occur only when inflation is consistently positive. ", " The Bank of England (BoE), Bank of Canada (BoC), Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have all raised their policy rates over the past three months (Table 3, Graph 15). The two 25 basis point increases by the BoC have partially reversed a cumulative easing of 75 basis points at its first three meetings this year. The market's expectation is that the tightening cycle in both the UK and New Zealand is nearly complete, whereas both the BoC and the SNB are expected to tighten policy further over the coming year. ", " Monetary policy was also tightened in a number of emerging markets. In China, benchmark interest rates were raised and the ceiling on bank lending rates was also removed. These actions follow administrative tightening measures and increases in reserve requirements adopted over the past year. India, Thailand and Taiwan each increased interest rates for the first time in the current cycle, although policy rates in the latter two countries remain below 2 per cent. Short-term interest rates also increased in Hong Kong following the US tightenings, in line with Hong Kong's currency board arrangement. In contrast, the Bank of Korea surprised markets by lowering the overnight call rate by 25 basis points, to 3.5 per cent, in order to stimulate lacklustre domestic demand, notwithstanding the economy's ongoing inflation concerns. ", " Mounting inflationary pressures across Latin America prompted the central banks of Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru to tighten monetary policy. Among emerging European countries, the central banks of the Czech Republic, Poland and the Ukraine all increased their policy rates. In contrast, monetary policy was eased in Hungary and South Africa because of the impact of their appreciating exchange rates in terms of easing inflationary pressures. Turkey reduced rates by 200 basis points, reflecting growing confidence that inflation will continue to fall under a new IMF program. ", " Despite the 75 basis points increase in the federal funds rate, long-term bond yields in the US have declined steadily since mid year, falling back to around 4 per cent (Graph 16). The large rise in oil prices has had a marked influence on bond yields over the period. As mentioned above, the market is expecting the contractionary effect of oil price rises on growth to outweigh their inflationary effect, and hence increases in the oil price have tended to be associated with a decrease in yields over recent months. Indeed, the expected inflation rate derived from indexed bond yields has drifted lower over the past six months. The decline in bond yields has also been driven by a reduction in the expected pace of tightening over the coming year, in turn reflecting weaker-than-expected US employment data in recent months and the anticipated effect of the oil price rises. ", " Yields in Europe and Japan have closely followed those in the US over the past three months. Yields on German government 10-year debt have fallen around 50 basis points since their mid-June peak, while Japanese yields fell back to around the levels seen prior to the sharp increase in June. ", " The desire of investors to seek out higher yields in an environment of low funding costs, combined with a favourable economic climate globally, has seen risk spreads continue to decline. US corporate spreads to Treasury yields have narrowed modestly over recent months and have reversed the widening that occurred in May in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle (Graph 17). Given the relatively low level of Treasury yields, the absolute cost of corporate borrowing is at a very low level. ", " Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt have also continued to reverse the widening that occurred earlier in the year (Graph 18). The decline has been particularly marked in Latin America following credit rating upgrades for Brazil and Venezuela. Similarly, the narrowing in emerging Europe was supported by upgrades to the credit rating outlook for Russia and Poland, in the former case prompted in part by rising oil revenue. Spreads in Asia narrowed slightly. ", " In the US, the S&amp;P 500 is little changed so far this year, after the strong increases last year (Table 4). The recent lacklustre performance comes despite continued strong growth in company profits: S&amp;P 500 operating earnings rose by 32 per cent in the year to the June quarter, while growth in ‘as reported’ earnings was even stronger, at 39 per cent. ", " High oil and commodity prices have boosted profits in the energy and materials sectors, which both recorded growth in operating earnings of around 70 per cent in the year to the June quarter. Shares in the energy sector have risen by 24 per cent this year (Table 5), but this sector accounts for only 7 per cent of the S&amp;P 500. However, the net impact of high oil prices on the overall market has been negative. Along with some tempering of the optimism that prevailed earlier in the year about the growth outlook, rising oil prices have contributed to the expectation that profit growth will slow considerably in the period ahead. Only the industrials sector and the telecommunications sector – which was the only sector to record a fall in earnings in the year to June – are expected to register a modest improvement in profit growth over 2004. ", " In mid October, shares in the insurance industry fell by over 10 per cent as the New York Attorney General charged Marsh &amp; McLennan, the largest insurance broker, with improper practices. Shares in the auto industry also declined sharply following poor earnings figures from General Motors (GM) and news of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into pension and health benefit accounting procedures at Ford and GM. ", " In the euro area, equity markets have risen by 7 per cent since the last <em>Statement</em>, and are up by a similar amount in 2004 to date. In Japan, on the other hand, the combination of higher oil prices and the unexpected downward revision to second quarter GDP have seen equities fall by 4 per cent over this period; however they remain 5 per cent higher in the year to date. ", " Emerging equity markets have outperformed those in the major economies in recent months, with share prices in both Latin America and emerging Asia rising by an average of around 11 per cent since early August. <span class=\"no-wrap\">South Korean</span> share prices have risen by 18 per cent in response to the Bank of Korea's decision to lower interest rates to boost domestic demand. Indonesian equities rose by 17 per cent over the past three months, supported by the election of the new President. The equity market in Argentina has experienced the strongest gains in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Latin America</span> in recent months, rising by 31 per cent following the Argentine government's recent agreement to reschedule some of its defaulted debt, but this follows a decline of around 35 per cent earlier in the year. ", " For much of the past three months, there was little to provide clear direction for foreign exchange markets, and the US dollar traded within a narrow range of 109 to 112 against the yen and around 1.20 to 1.25 against the euro. However, since late October, it appears that the US dollar has renewed the path of depreciation it has been on since early 2002 (Graph 19). The US dollar fell as low as 1.28 against the euro, just above the trough reached in mid February, and below 106 against the yen. ", " The currencies of a number of countries seen as having large exports of commodities (Australia, Canada, <span class=\"no-wrap\">New Zealand)</span> have risen by more than most other currencies against the US dollar over the past couple of months (Table 6), reflecting the continuing strength of global commodity markets and notwithstanding a sharp drop in base metal prices in mid October. ", " Latin American exchange rates have appreciated by an average of 4 per cent against the US dollar since early August. In part this has reflected the increasingly positive economic outlook for Latin America – in particular Brazil, where the real has strengthened by around 8 per cent against the US dollar since the last <em>Statement</em>. In contrast, a number of Asian currencies have moved by only relatively small amounts against the US dollar, as intervention activity appears to have increased again. The pound sterling has shown little net movement recently, reflecting the assessment that the Bank of England's tightening cycle is close to complete. ", " Expectations of a revaluation of the Chinese currency have reappeared in the past three months, after having been scaled back considerably since the early part of the year. Speculation centred on a change to China's exchange rate regime associated with the October meeting of G7 Finance Ministers. However, Chinese officials have continued to deny that any change is likely in the immediate future, although they have indicated that they have examined possible alternative regimes. The 1-year non-deliverable forward (NDF) rate for the renminbi has risen by around 2 per cent in the past three months, to be around 3 per cent higher than the spot rate, and <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> higher than the rate implied by interest differentials alone. Despite the recent strengthening in expectations of a revaluation, the probability attached to a revaluation remains lower than at the beginning of the year, when renminbi NDFs were trading at a premium of 5 per cent to the spot rate, and 7 per cent to the rate implied by interest differentials. ", " The Australian dollar reached a six-month high on both a trade-weighted basis and against the US dollar in early November (Graph 20). As noted above, the strength in the Australian dollar has been in line with that in currencies of other commodity exporters (Table 7). Another factor supporting the Australian dollar has been the continuation of solid Uridashi issuance, which has amounted to around A$6 billion over the past three months. ", " The strong demand for the Australian dollar over the past couple of years has meant that the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar/</span>US dollar is now the fourth most traded currency pair globally, according to the latest survey of foreign exchange activity published by the Bank for International Settlements (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). ", " In line with the recent movements in the exchange rate, market sentiment towards the Australian dollar has become more positive recently, after declining sharply as the exchange rate fell from its peak in mid February. Speculative positioning in Australian dollar futures on the Chicago Futures Exchange has risen significantly to relatively substantial long positions, which are now back at levels last seen in early February (Graph 21). Sentiment in the Australian dollar options market, as indicated by 1-month risk reversals (a measure derived from the relative prices of put and call options in the Australian dollar), has returned to its highest level in around seven months. That is, there is now substantially less probability attached to a near-term depreciation of the Australian dollar than was the case some months ago. Over the past three months, Australian dollar volatility has also fallen back to around its post-float average after rising sharply in the first half of the year. ", " Over the past three months, the Bank's foreign exchange purchases were broadly in line with the amount needed to cover sales of foreign exchange to the Government. As a result, net reserves have remained relatively unchanged at just under $25 billion since the middle of the year. Holdings of foreign exchange under swaps have fluctuated, due to the continuing use of swaps in domestic liquidity management. ", " Growth in the Australian economy remains solid, though the expected impetus from the external sector has not yet developed. In the June quarter, GDP grew by 0.6 per cent, with growth over the year above trend at <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.1 per cent</span>, reflecting the very strong quarterly outcomes in the second half of 2003 (Graph 22). Growth in the June quarter was driven by domestic demand, with continued strong consumption spending, a rebound in business investment and a further increase in dwelling investment. Partly offsetting this strength was a much less rapid accumulation of stocks than in the March quarter, and a further fall in net exports as imports rose slightly faster than exports, though the subtraction from growth was only modest. The recovery in the rural sector also appears to have run its course, with farm production falling in the quarter after a run of sizeable contributions to GDP growth. ", " Although forward indicators suggest a slowing in business investment growth and the possibility of modest falls in dwelling investment in the second half of 2004, household consumption is likely to stay firm, with consumer sentiment remaining around record highs and households receiving a substantial boost to their incomes from recent Budget initiatives. A rebalancing of activity between domestic and external sources of demand is also likely to become evident over the year ahead, with net exports expected to be a much smaller drag on growth than in the past few years. ", " The rapid pace of consumer spending over the course of 2003 and early 2004 continued into the June quarter, with household consumption rising by 1.1 per cent to be 6.1 per cent higher over the year; this was the fifth consecutive quarterly rise in excess of 1 per cent. Growth in the June quarter was concentrated in services, with particular strength in spending on transport, health and recreation &amp; culture; growth in spending on goods was more moderate. More recently, in the September quarter, the volume of retail sales increased by 0.9 per cent. Much of the growth occurred late in the quarter, with the value of retail sales rising by 0.8 per cent in September; this followed a pullback in spending in the preceding two months from the spike recorded in June. Retail spending has been especially volatile in recent months, partly reflecting the staggered timing of the government payments to households related to measures announced in the 2004/05 Budget. Spending on motor vehicles rose slightly in the September quarter to a record high (Graph 23). ", " The ongoing strength in consumption is being underpinned by a generally favourable economic environment. Household incomes remain supported by solid employment growth and rising real wages. Earlier strong gains in house prices have increased household wealth significantly since the late 1990s. Households have also received income tax cuts and increased family benefit payments in recent months, with a further cut in income tax to take effect next July. Consistent with these factors, consumer sentiment has remained close to its highest level in <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 years</span>. Nevertheless, the sharply higher fuel prices evident in recent months are likely to contain growth in discretionary expenditure. Furthermore, as wealth effects diminish in line with the easing in house prices <span class=\"no-wrap\">since late 2003</span>, households may become more restrained in their spending. ", " Total household assets have risen at a modest pace during 2004, after increasing significantly in the preceding <span class=\"no-wrap\">five years</span>, reflecting the recent moderation in house price growth. However, at the same time, household borrowings have been rising strongly, by around 17 per cent over the past year. With ongoing rises in household debt, the burden of servicing it is now historically high, reaching over 9 per cent of household disposable income in the June quarter (Graph 24). While this ratio was largely unchanged from the March quarter, it is expected to increase further as a consequence of ongoing credit growth. At this stage, though, there is little indication that debt-servicing burdens are affecting household behaviour, with personal bankruptcy rates and housing loan arrears at very low levels. ", " Dwelling investment continued to expand over the first half of 2004, though at a much slower pace than during the second half of 2003. It increased by around 1 per cent in the June quarter, to be almost 12 per cent higher over the year, with the increase in the quarter driven by growth in alterations and additions while new dwelling construction was broadly unchanged. ", " The housing construction sector is operating at close to maximum capacity, with a large stock of outstanding work to be done. However, forward indicators point to an easing in new construction in the period ahead. The downward trend evident in building approvals for houses over the past year has continued in recent months, with house approvals now 13.7 per cent lower than the average in 2003. The volatile medium-density series is still at a high level, but is well below the peaks seen in recent years (Graph 25). Other leading indicators of housing demand, including display home traffic and land sales, remain subdued in most states, and the Housing Industry Association series of commitments to build fell further in September. Despite the recent easing in demand, residential construction activity is expected to remain around current levels for the remainder of 2004, supported by the large amount of work in the pipeline. This is particularly so in the medium-density sector, where many apartments are committed for construction. There are also many apartment projects that have been approved but not yet commenced, though it is not clear whether this reflects delays as a result of capacity constraints or cancellations of building work approved as investors retreat from this market. Housing activity is also likely to be supported by continued high levels of alterations and additions, given the backlog of work and continuing strong demand for renovations. ", " After peaking at $15 billion in late 2003, the value of monthly housing loan approvals has been broadly stable during 2004, averaging just above $12 billion per month (Graph 26). This stability has masked divergent trends in loan approvals to owner-occupiers and investors. After declines late last year, approvals to owner-occupiers have since grown, while those to investors have continued to fall. This fall is likely to reflect diminished prospects of capital growth and the recognition of persistently low returns in rental markets. ", " The rate of growth of housing credit has continued to decline during 2004. In September, housing credit increased by 1 per cent following a similar rise in August. On a three-month-ended basis, a pronounced slowing is now apparent, with housing credit expanding at an annual rate of 13 per cent over the latest three months, compared with a peak growth rate of 24 per cent over the three months to November last year. The decline in housing-related credit growth has been larger than expected based on the fall in loan approvals to date, suggesting that, among other things, some combination of a pick-up in repayments and lower usage of mortgage redraw facilities has contributed to the decline. ", " A reasonable range of information on house prices in the September quarter is now available. As in the March and June quarters, the majority of indicators show that house prices fell in the quarter, and over the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">date (Graph 27 and Table 8).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup></span> Figures from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (which are based on house purchases funded by the CBA and are not subject to revision) suggest that nationwide house prices fell in the September quarter, with declines in most capitals. Data from the state Real Estate Institutes (REIs) point to moderate falls or broadly unchanged prices in the four capitals for which September quarter data were available at the start of November. Data from land titles offices supplied by Australian Property Monitors (APM) also point to a fall in average nationwide prices for transactions contracted in the September quarter, but these are only early estimates and are subject to upward revision as more transactions are recorded. Data on repeat sales from Residex, also from land titles offices, point to house prices falling slightly in Sydney and Brisbane and rising slightly in Melbourne. Overall, in the March and June quarters, the falls in house prices were concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne. In the September quarter, the falls were more widespread, with other capitals except Adelaide (where prices were broadly flat) also showing falls in prices. In Brisbane, where prices were still rising earlier in the year, all four available measures now show falls in the September quarter. There is less information available for Perth and Canberra, but it also suggests significant falls. ", " Nationwide prices of apartments show a similar pattern of subdued outturns in 2004 following strong growth in 2003 (Graph 28). Estimates of price changes in the September quarter are mixed but point to a continuation of relatively weak market conditions. ", " Although they represent only a small proportion of total sales, auction results suggest that demand remains subdued in the housing market, despite a modest pick-up in clearance rates from their trough in mid 2004 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 29)</span>. Likewise, auction volumes have shown tentative signs of recovery, though in Sydney and Melbourne they remain around half the level recorded in previous years. ", " Conditions in the business sector overall remain strong. Business sentiment and investment intentions are above historical norms, profitability is at a high level and the global economic expansion is beginning to provide some impetus to growth in trade-exposed industries. ", " Production in the non-farm economy continued to grow at a solid pace in the June quarter, while farm output fell, with its recovery from the drought-induced trough of 2002/03 now largely complete. In the non-farm economy, domestically oriented industries have maintained their strong growth performance of recent years, supported by continued strength in construction activity, retail trade and a recovery in business services (Graph 30). A pick-up in growth in trade-exposed industries reflects a recent increase in export-oriented manufacturing and transport, while the earlier subtraction from mining has dissipated as temporary disruptions to supply have been resolved. However, surveys suggest that further progress in the rebalancing of growth is likely to occur fairly slowly. ", " Most business surveys continue to report highly favourable conditions in the non-farm sector, particularly in those industries sensitive to domestic demand. According to the NAB survey, business conditions edged higher in the September quarter to remain well above their long-term average, and close to their highest level in the past decade (Graph 31). Respondents reported high levels of employment, profitability and trading conditions. Capacity utilisation approached the highest levels recorded for this series, while labour availability remained a constraint. In contrast, exports were reportedly relatively subdued, a common theme across a number of surveys, though they have picked up in the September quarter. Looking ahead, businesses expect an export recovery underpinned by strong demand for resources. ", " The ACCI-Westpac and the AIG surveys of the manufacturing sector paint a similar picture, with business confidence and most indicators of activity at or above long-run average levels, though in both of these surveys respondents have scaled back their expectations of the likely extent of the export recovery. The Sensis Business Index, which covers small and medium-sized businesses, reported business confidence in trading conditions over the next 12 months at the highest level in the 11-year history of the survey, with high levels of employment, profitability and capital expenditure. ", " Corporate profitability remains exceptionally high, with the gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations running at its highest share of GDP in over four decades. Corporate profits grew strongly in the June quarter to be 16½ per cent higher over the year, reflecting a recovery in the profits of some trade-exposed industries, predominantly mining, which has benefited from rising commodity prices and strong world demand. Following a string of strong outturns, profits in the domestically oriented sectors appear to have moderated somewhat in the June quarter, though they remain solid. Profits of unincorporated enterprises fell in the June quarter, but were significantly higher over the year, mainly reflecting developments in the farm sector. Looking forward, both business surveys and equity markets suggest that strong profits growth is expected to persist. ", " The high level of corporate profitability continues to provide firms with substantial internal funds to pursue their investment plans. In addition, the corporate sector also has access to ample external funding. Over the year to September, business credit grew by 9 per cent and non-intermediated debt increased by 11 per cent, while equity raisings were broadly in line with their average over the past five years. ", " After contracting in the March quarter 2004, business investment grew by around 4½ per cent in the June quarter, to be 10 per cent higher over the year. The June quarter outcome was driven by a strong rebound in equipment investment. Investment in computer software also increased notably in the quarter, continuing the recovery from a period of weakness, though growth remains slower than recorded during the late 1990s boom. Investment in buildings and structures fell slightly in the June quarter, reflecting a sizeable fall in engineering construction activity (as some major projects were completed), which more than offset a strong rise in non-residential building activity. ", " The latest capital expenditure (Capex) survey points to solid growth in business investment in 2004/05, underpinned by strong planned expenditure on buildings and structures. Intentions for machinery and equipment investment, adjusted by a five-year average realisation ratio, suggest modest growth in real terms following a period of rapid growth over the past three years. Investment in equipment is expected to be supported by growth in the finance and insurance industry, consistent with the buoyant outlook for the business services sector signalled by surveys of businesses and liaison. Furthermore, the Rabobank survey reports that equipment investment in the farm sector – which is not included in the Capex survey – is likely to be strong over the year ahead at around pre-drought levels. ", " Other forward-looking indicators also suggest continued near-term strength in non-residential construction <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 32)</span>. Activity is expected to be supported by the backlog of engineering work yet to be done, with more than two quarters' worth of work still to be completed, and much road and resource-related engineering work scheduled for commencement. However, the near-term outlook for non-residential building is less favourable; while the value of work approved increased by 13.4 per cent in the September quarter, the volume of work approved earlier in 2004 fell well below that recorded in 2003. Moreover, rising construction costs may threaten the viability of some building projects currently in the planning stages. ", " Labour market conditions have remained firm in recent months. Employment grew by 2.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter, exceeding the average pace of employment growth for the past decade of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. Most of the growth over the year has been in full-time employment, although part-time work also picked up in the quarter (Graph 33). This recent strength follows an apparent lull in employment growth between April and August which the ABS has since partly attributed to sampling problems. ", " Having declined over most of the past financial year, the unemployment rate has been fairly stable in recent months at a level close to the lows reached in 1981 and 1989 (Graph 34). Broader measures of labour underutilisation have also fallen, though they point to slightly less tightness in the labour market than suggested by the unemployment rate (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>: ‘Indicators of Labour Market Tightness’). The participation rate has remained around 63½ per cent over the past few months, consistent with its average of the past few years. ", " Employment has increased in all states over the year to the September quarter, though outcomes were varied around the country (Table 9). The strongest growth was seen in Queensland, reflecting the rapid expansion in final demand in that state. In contrast, employment growth continues to be subdued in South Australia and below average in New South Wales. Consistent with the expansion of employment, unemployment rates have declined in most states over the past year. Queensland recorded a particularly sharp fall, as did Western Australia, which has an unemployment rate well below that in other parts of the country. Despite solid employment growth over the past year, Victoria's unemployment rate has picked up noticeably. This has been associated with increased labour force participation among both males and females. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand continue to point to solid employment growth in the near term <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 35)</span>. The ABS measure of job vacancies has grown strongly over the past year, as have various internet-based vacancy series. And while print-based indicators have remained relatively flat over the past year, recent business surveys suggest that hiring intentions remain well above long-run average levels. ", " The current account deficit has been broadly unchanged over the past year and a half, as a sharp rise in the terms of trade has been accompanied by strong growth in import volumes and only a modest recovery in export volumes. More recently, growth in imports appears to have moderated from the unsustainable pace seen around the start of the year, while the expansion in export volumes has remained weaker than might have been expected given the pick-up in global demand and in world commodity prices since mid last year (Graph 36). The trade deficit in the September quarter 2004 is estimated at around 3 per cent of GDP, while the current account deficit is likely to have remained around the 6 per cent of GDP range that has prevailed in <span class=\"no-wrap\">recent quarters (Graph 37)</span>. ", " Export earnings have increased over the past year by around 14 per cent, driven by rising export prices and a recovery in rural and services export volumes (Graph 38). Export earnings increased slightly in the September quarter. With a modest depreciation of the Australian dollar and higher world commodity prices in the September quarter, export prices rose significantly, suggesting that volumes fell in the quarter. ", " The value of rural exports has increased strongly from the trough associated with the drought, rising by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">34 per cent</span> over the year to the September quarter. This increase has been mostly driven by a rise in volumes, particularly of cereals, following the record 2003/04 winter crop. However, it appears that the recovery in rural exports has largely run its course, with a fall in value terms in the September quarter together with an increase in prices, implying a quarterly fall in export volumes. Looking ahead, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) expects the current winter crop to be lower than in 2003/04, but still above average levels. Some downside risk to this forecast remains because spring rainfall has been insufficient in some areas. ABARE expects that herd rebuilding will restrain growth in beef production and exports, while the volume of exports of other livestock-based products is expected to expand modestly. The chance of an <span lang=\"es\">El Niño</span> event re-emerging remains a downside risk to rural production over the coming year. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the situation remains ‘delicately balanced’ with some, but not all, indicators at levels characteristic of an <span lang=\"es\">El Niño</span> event. ", " The value of resource exports has risen sharply over the past year or so, and continued to rise solidly in the September quarter, but this was entirely a price effect owing to strength in commodity prices, even when measured in Australian dollars. The weakness in export volumes continues a trend that has been apparent over the past few years, reflecting supply disruptions and capacity constraints, especially for mineral fuels and coal. Nevertheless, as was discussed in the previous <em>Statement</em>, the outlook for growth of resource exports over the next year or two is positive, given that liaison continues to indicate strong external demand for resources. The completion of a number of mineral and energy projects and infrastructure expansions is also expected to boost production and transport capacity. These include the 4th LNG production train at the North-West Shelf and recently commissioned oil fields in the Pilbara region and the Timor Sea. The resumption of production at the Moomba plant is also likely to contribute to a moderate rise in oil exports. ", " After picking up strongly in the first half of 2004, the value of manufactured exports declined by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the September quarter, to be broadly unchanged over the past year. Export volumes also appear to have fallen in the quarter, since trade price data suggest that the prices received for manufactures rose. Growth in manufactured exports continues to lag the pick-up in activity among our trading partners. According to the AIG Survey of Manufacturing and liaison with firms, this appears to reflect strong competition in export markets and a loss of competitiveness over recent years owing to the appreciation of the Australian dollar since 2001. In addition, some firms are likely to have been directing production towards the domestic market given the strength of domestic demand. There is nonetheless a positive outlook for manufactured exports with strong trading partner growth and the exchange rate down from its peak near the start of 2004, though growth is likely to be more moderate than during the 1990s. ", " The value of services exports grew by about 1 per cent in the September quarter and is at a relatively high level, in line with recent strength in short-term visitor arrivals. The outlook for services exports is favourable, supported by the ongoing global economic upswing, and tourism industry contacts remain positive about prospects for the period ahead. ", " Growth in import volumes has moderated over recent quarters, following a strong expansion over the second half of 2003, and a surge in the March quarter 2004 that saw annual growth in import volumes of 16 per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 36)</span>. The earlier strength in imports was broadly based across all categories of goods and services, and was driven by robust growth in domestic demand and low import prices flowing from the appreciation of the Australian dollar in 2002 and 2003. However, the growth of imports slowed in the June quarter and appears to have moderated further in the September quarter. The value of imports rose by 2¾ per cent in the September quarter, with volumes likely to have been broadly unchanged. The recent easing in the pace of growth of import volumes comes after a period when it was unusually high, and is a response to the slowing in domestic demand in the first half of 2004 and the depreciation of the Australian dollar from its February 2004 peak. ", " Commodity prices have continued to increase strongly. The RBA Index of Commodity Prices rose by 2.1 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to October, supported by rising prices of base metals and other resources, and is around 16 per cent higher than a year ago (Graph 39, Table 10). Commodity prices in Australian dollar terms have also increased slightly of late, rising by 0.2 per cent over the past three months, to remain close to the elevated levels seen during 2001–2002. ", " Base metals prices increased by 3.4 per cent over the three months to October to reach a new high for the current cycle, although much of the latest increase had been unwound by early November. The pick-up in prices in late September, which was partly attributed to an easing of fears about a pronounced slowdown in China, proved unsustainable, though prices have remained close to recent peaks. Strong global demand has ensured that markets remain tight; reported stocks of aluminium and copper have fallen recently, and copper stocks, in particular, are currently at low levels. The price of copper has also been supported by supply disruptions from strikes in Spain and Chile. ", " Prices for bulk commodities, particularly for steaming coal, have continued to rise. Steaming coal prices in US dollar terms increased by 9.2 per cent over the three months to September, and are more than 60 per cent higher over 2004 to date, in line with the large contract price increases achieved earlier in the year. Similarly, US-dollar coking coal prices rose by 3.0 per cent over the three months to September, and have risen by close to 33 per cent over the year so far. While spot prices for steaming coal have recently eased from previous highs, they remain well above the contract prices set earlier in the year. Spot prices have been supported by ongoing strength in demand, which bodes well for the forthcoming contract price negotiations for 2005/06. ", " The strength of world demand has also been a factor helping to drive up oil prices. As discussed in detail in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-economic-developments\">International Economic Developments</a>’, US-dollar oil prices have risen by around 75 per cent over the past year. This is likely to put upward pressure on other energy prices that are in the RBA Index. Similarly, the price of gold has risen over the past three months, driven partly by the recent gains in oil prices and the decline in the value of the US dollar against the euro. ", " Movements in rural commodity prices have been more mixed over the past three months, as higher beef and sugar prices have been largely offset by lower prices for barley, cotton and wool. Beef prices have remained high as a result of ongoing strong demand in the US and the BSE-related ban on imports of US beef into Japan, though these restrictions have eased recently. In contrast, barley and cotton prices have fallen as a result of improving prospects for sizeable expansions in global production. ", " The ongoing strength in commodity prices, particularly for coal, has continued to support Australia's terms of trade. After an increase in the terms of trade to the highest level in almost 30 years in the June quarter, the terms of trade are estimated to have increased further in the September quarter (Graph 40). ", " Long-term bond yields have fallen since the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>. Yields on 10-year government bonds are now around 5.4 per cent, about 30 basis points below levels in early August and around 65 basis points below their recent peak in mid June. Yields on 10-year inflation-linked bonds have fallen by a similar amount and, at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.8 per cent</span>, are close to their lowest recorded levels (Graph 41). ", " While long-term yields have been affected by domestic news at times, the main factor behind their fall has been developments in overseas bond markets. Concern that rising oil prices may dampen the global recovery appears to have weighed on US yields which, in turn, have led local yields lower. With longer-term yields moving broadly in line with those in the US since early August, the spread between Australian and US 10-year yields has moved in a fairly narrow range around 130 basis points. ", " The recent falls in bond yields have seen the spread between yields on 10-year government bonds and the cash rate narrow to 15 basis points, well below its long-run average. Yields on bonds with maturities out to four years are below the cash rate. A yield curve of this shape normally suggests that the market attaches a greater probability to the cash rate falling than rising. While this would be consistent with a view that rising oil prices will cause nominal economic activity to slow significantly, it is at odds with other indicators of cash rate expectations and suggests, to some observers, a degree of speculative overvaluation in the domestic bond market. ", " A clearer measure of the market's expectations for the cash rate over the next year or so can be gauged from short-dated instruments such as overnight indexed swaps. While these instruments suggest the market has indeed scaled back its expectations of a further tightening of domestic monetary policy, they do not suggest the market expects the cash rate to fall. Rather, the market expects the cash rate to most likely remain at its current level over the next year or so (Graph 42). ", " The pricing of credit risk also supports the view that financial markets do not expect a significant slowing in economic activity. Credit risk perceptions, as measured by spreads on corporate bonds and credit default swaps, have changed little over the past few months and remain low by historical standards, indicating that markets see the continuation of favourable trading conditions for corporations. ", " Intermediaries' variable indicator lending rates have not changed since the last <em>Statement</em>, consistent with there having been no change in the target cash rate. Interest rates on fixed-rate housing and small business loans declined over the same period, in line with a decrease in the cost of funding these loans (Graph 43). As is typical, fixed rates on small business loans followed the movement in funding costs most closely, with the major banks' average 3-year rate falling by around 25 basis points since early August. ", " Housing fixed rates, which tend to be adjusted less frequently than the fixed rates on small business loans, have fallen since late September, following a period of around seven months when they were largely unchanged. The major banks' average 3-year fixed housing rate is currently 6.65 per cent, around 30 basis points lower than in the months beforehand and around 40 basis points below the standard variable rate (Table 11 and Graph 44). ", " According to the latest available data, demand for fixed-rate housing loans remains relatively low. In the <span class=\"no-wrap\">three months</span> to August, the share of new owner-occupier housing loans taken out at fixed rates was steady at around 7 per cent, compared with an average share of 9 per cent over the past five years and a recent peak of 15 per cent a year ago, when monetary policy was being tightened (Graph 44). Use of fixed-rate loans is higher among small businesses but has been in trend decline for a number of years. ", " Australian share prices have risen by 8 per cent since the last <em>Statement</em> and reached new record highs during the period (Graph 45). The rise in the Australian equity market has been greater than that in most other industrialised countries. It has also been broad-based, although companies in the industrials, consumer staples and, until recently, energy sectors performed most strongly. Price increases in the energy sector were driven by the strength in oil prices, while developments in the other two sectors reflected a combination of strong profit results and acquisitions activity. ", " The ASX 200 index is currently 10 per cent above its previous high in March 2002, largely because of the strong performance of the materials and energy sectors over the past couple of years. In contrast, prices in the consumer discretionary, health care, telecoms and IT sectors remain at least 25 per cent below their own record highs (Graph 46). ", " Despite the strong performance of the Australian equity market in recent months, valuation measures have not deteriorated: the price/earnings ratio has fallen over 2004, reflecting the strong results reported for the 2003/04 financial year, and is now only a little above its long-run average; the dividend yield, while down a bit over recent months, remains in line with its average over the past 10 years and compares favourably with the average level of real bond yields in recent years; and equity analysts' earnings forecasts, of around 8 per cent per annum over the next three to five years, are lower than the average of recent years (Graph 47). ", " Australian non-government entities issued $40 billion of bonds in the September quarter, continuing the strong issuance seen earlier in 2004. Issuance by financial institutions and asset-backed vehicles was lower in the September quarter, consistent with some moderation in housing credit, but non-financial corporates' issuance, which had been relatively subdued during the first half of 2004, picked up (Table 12). ", " In both domestic and offshore markets, Australian entities' gross bond issuance in 2004 has already exceeded that seen in previous full years (Graph 48). Factors behind this strength include both the need to fund the strong growth in household credit, notwithstanding its recent moderation, and strong demand by investors for bonds, especially in light of continued tightness in government debt markets. ", " Non-resident issuers have also issued more Australian dollar bonds in the first 10 months of 2004 than in any previous year, prompted by demand for higher-quality bonds and favourable basis swap spreads. ", " As well as record issuance, 2004 has seen further signs of deepening of the domestic bond market. The past quarter has seen a broader range of issuers come to the market and a greater ability to issue in larger amounts or for longer maturities. The broadening in the range of issuers reflects in part the prospective change to the composition of the major bond indexes against which many funds managers benchmark themselves, to include BBB-rated bonds for the first time. ", " Issuance of hybrid securities (instruments with features of both equities and debt) has increased recently, with $2.9 billion of such securities issued since the previous <em>Statement</em>. The type of securities being issued has changed in recent months, with new issues being predominantly perpetual securities that contain conversion options for the issuers and a higher interest rate if the option is not exercised. Previously, the securities often contained conversion options for the investor as well as the issuer. The change appears to have been precipitated by the forthcoming adoption of international accounting standards, which have more restrictions on the type of securities that can be classified as equity and hence qualify as Tier 1 capital. ", " Net equity raisings totalled $4.2 billion in the September quarter, roughly in line with the quarterly average since the start of 2000. Although a higher-than-average number of companies listed in the September quarter, the amount of capital raised through IPOs ($1.2 billion) was only in line with its quarterly average for the past couple of years (Graph 49). Listings by companies in the materials and energy sectors accounted for almost 40 per cent of the total number of listings. Other (gross) equity raisings totalled $4 billion, and was dominated by <span class=\"no-wrap\">NAB's $1.2 billion</span> dividend reinvestment plan. Buyback activity was weak in the September quarter, but is expected to increase in the December quarter following announcements of large off-market buybacks by BHP Billiton and Telstra. ", " Financial conditions continue to be accommodative of domestic economic growth. The cash rate has remained at 5.25 per cent since December last year, a level slightly below its average over the past decade. Credit growth, while having eased back from its very rapid pace of late last year, remains strong. On balance, most other financial indicators also suggest that financial conditions remain supportive for both the household and business sectors. ", " Total credit increased at an annualised rate of 14 per cent over the six months to September 2004 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 13</span> and Graph 50). While this rate of growth is down from the brisk pace of late 2003, it is still above the average of recent years. The slowing has been attributable to a slowing in household credit, which has been partly offset by stronger business credit. ", " While the growth of household credit continues to decline, it remains high at an annualised rate of 14 per cent over the six months to September. Most of this decline is accounted for by a fall in housing credit growth which, at an annualised rate of 15 per cent over the six months to September, is some 8 percentage points below the peak reached in December last year. The fall in terms of three-month-ended growth rates is somewhat larger, reflecting both the very high monthly growth rates at the end of 2003 and declining growth rates during 2004 (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic Conditions</a>’ for further discussion). Growth in personal credit for purposes other than housing has also slowed from its recent peak, though the moderation is not as marked as it is for housing. ", " The decline in the growth of housing credit over the year reflects a significant drop in housing loan approvals from the peak reached in late 2003, with much of the fall occurring over the turn of the year. Since then, loan approvals for investment properties have continued to fall, while loan approvals for owner-occupied housing have risen. These offsetting influences have resulted in a fairly flat profile for aggregate housing loan approvals in 2004. The most recent loan approvals data appear to be consistent with housing credit growth remaining relatively high in the near term at rates close to those of recent months. ", " In contrast to the slowing in household credit, the pace of business credit growth has picked up over the course of the past six months. Business credit grew at an annualised rate of around 12 per cent over the six months to September, bringing it above rates seen in late 2003. Business loan approvals are also at a very high level, suggesting that businesses are having little difficulty in obtaining new finance from financial institutions. ", " Consistent with the unchanged cash rate, household and business variable lending rates have remained unchanged during 2004, at just below their averages of the past decade (Graph 51). As discussed in the ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic                          Financial Markets</a>’ chapter, longer-term bond yields have been edging lower, with three, five and 10-year bond yields all falling to levels close to, or even below, the current cash rate. Typically a decline in longer-term yields relative to the cash rate would be interpreted as a sign that monetary policy had become less accommodative. However, in the current situation, developments in foreign bond markets, particularly in the US, appear to have driven longer-term Australian yields lower. ", " Other indicators of financial conditions suggest that, on balance, monetary policy remains mildly accommodative. The real cash rate is likely to have declined given that measures of inflation expectations have risen while the cash rate has been unchanged over the past few months. In real terms, the trade-weighted exchange rate has risen slightly over recent months, to be about 10 per cent above its average over the post-float period (Graph 52). However, this has been accompanied by further gains in the terms of trade to a level that is about 20 per cent above its post-float average. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.4 per cent in the September quarter to be 2.3 per cent higher over the year (Graph 53). Petrol prices increased by 3.3 per cent in the September quarter and by 12 per cent over the year, contributing significantly to CPI inflation. Excluding petrol, the CPI increased by 0.3 per cent in the September quarter. Based on a range of measures, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation over the year to September was slightly lower than CPI inflation (Table 14). ", " The most noteworthy aspects of inflation outcomes over the past year or so have been the decline in the price of tradable items (excluding food and petrol) following the earlier appreciation of the exchange rate, while non-tradable prices have continued to rise relatively quickly. In the September quarter, the prices of tradable items declined slightly, with further falls in prices of motor vehicles and audio-visual equipment. It appears, however, that the disinflationary impact of the earlier appreciation of the exchange rate is waning, with the rate of decline in tradable prices (excluding food and petrol) moderating in year-ended terms (Graph 54). ", " Price rises in a number of non-tradable goods and services have made a sizeable contribution to CPI inflation. Non-tradable inflation was 0.9 per cent in the September quarter, with ongoing pressure in house purchase costs, though these have eased from the very strong rates of a year ago. There were also further strong price rises for a range of administered items such as property rates and utilities. In year-ended terms, non-tradable inflation was 3.6 per cent in the September quarter, down from 4.1 per cent in the June quarter. ", " Producer price figures for the September quarter suggest that upstream price pressures are building at all stages of production. The prices of outputs from the final stage of domestic production rose strongly in the quarter – underpinned by significant increases in the prices of building construction, utilities and petroleum refining – to be 4.5 per cent higher over the year (Table 15 and Graph 55). Similarly, import prices at the final stage of production recorded a solid rise in the quarter, reflecting the influence of higher oil prices and broad-based increases in the prices of manufactured items. Excluding the effects of oil, the price of outputs from the final stage of production rose by 2.8 per cent over the year. These outcomes for domestic and import prices were consistent with liaison that suggests that the disinflationary impetus from the appreciation of the exchange rate in 2002 and 2003 has abated. For outputs at the earlier stages of production, the effects of large increases in commodity prices, particularly for oil, iron and steel, have resulted in large quarterly increases in prices in the September and June quarters. ", " The pick-up in output prices in the September quarter was most evident in the manufacturing and transport <span class=\"no-wrap\">&amp; storage</span> sectors, which faced sizeable increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel. While construction output prices rose somewhat less rapidly than in recent quarters, they have risen by more than 7 per cent over the year, reflecting persistent labour cost pressures as well as significant increases in material costs. There have been particularly large increases for steel prices, which are likely to rise further in coming months as major contracts are renewed. ", " While the demand for labour remains firm, there is little sign at this stage of the emergence of heightened wage pressures across the economy as a whole. The Wage Cost Index (WCI) increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, once again slightly less than expected, to be 3.6 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 56). <span class=\"no-wrap\">Public-sector</span> wage growth eased somewhat, but was still above that of the private sector, where wages grew by 3.4 per cent over the past year. Stronger wage outcomes were evident in the construction sector, consistent with reports of skills shortages, particularly in non-residential construction. ", " Other indicators also show broadly unchanged wage pressures on an economy-wide basis. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations reports that the average annualised wage increase certified in new enterprise bargaining agreements fell slightly to 3.8 per cent in the June quarter from 4.1 per cent in the March quarter. There was no change recorded in the average wage increase for the stock of existing agreements, which remained at 3.9 per cent. More timely data from the NAB Quarterly Business Survey suggest that labour costs have continued to build gradually, increasing by 3 per cent over the year to September, while expected labour cost pressures have remained steady. According to the Mercer Quarterly Salary Review, annual growth in the base salaries of executives rose to 4.8 per cent in the year to September, among the higher outcomes of recent years. ", " While economy-wide measures of wages growth have remained relatively stable, localised pressures are certainly evident in some official wage measures as well as through liaison, which points to substantial increases in wages for skilled employees in the construction and resource sectors, and in some areas of business services. Firms are also reporting strong growth in non-wage labour costs, including sub-contractor payments for self-employed workers, bonus payments to employees, and training for new (and typically less skilled) employees. These developments are consistent with survey data showing that firms are finding it increasingly difficult to attract suitably skilled labour, pointing to the possibility of stronger wage pressures emerging in the period ahead. (See <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B: ‘Indicators of Labour Market Tightness’</a> for further discussion.) ", " Measures of inflation expectations suggest that most observers expect inflation to rise gradually over the next two years from the moderate levels currently prevailing (Table 16). The Bank's survey of market economists showed that their median forecast for CPI inflation over this financial year was unchanged from last quarter. They continue to expect an increase in inflation over longer horizons, albeit a more modest one than had been anticipated last quarter. Union officials' median expectations of inflation were unchanged; they expect inflation to rise gradually through to mid 2005 before stabilising. ", " The inflation expectations implied by financial market prices have also been broadly unchanged over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past six months</span>. According to the difference between nominal and indexed bond yields, the market expects inflation over the medium term of around 2.6 per cent (Graph 57). However, relative to a year earlier, inflation expectations have shifted moderately higher. ", " The inflation expectations of consumers have been relatively stable despite significant increases in oil prices and the consequent rises in petrol prices. The Melbourne Institute survey reported that the median expectation for consumer price inflation in October remained close to its average level of the past six months. There has, however, been some pick-up in the inflation expectations of businesses. The NAB survey reported that the pace of economy-wide and retail product price inflation rose in the September quarter and is expected to remain around current levels in the December quarter. Similar outcomes are apparent in the quarterly AIG survey of manufacturers. ", " CPI inflation of 2.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter was down marginally from the previous quarter, with most underlying measures running slightly below the headline rate. Over the past couple of years, the trend in underlying inflation has been one of gradual decline, reflecting the impact of the exchange rate appreciation that took place during 2002 and 2003. However, with this effect now waning, underlying inflation is expected to remain around current levels before rising gradually from early next year to around 2½ per cent towards the end of 2005 and to around 2¾ per cent by mid 2006. While this profile is broadly in line with that presented at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>, it is noteworthy that the expected trough in inflation is not as low as had been forecast at the beginning of the year, when both headline and underlying measures were forecast to decline to a trough of around 1½ per cent near the end of 2004. This partly reflects the fact that the exchange rate has depreciated since early 2004. ", " Domestic inflationary risks appear to be tilted somewhat to the upside. Producer price data, business surveys and liaison indicate that upstream inflationary pressures, both from materials and labour costs, are building. ", " Another important consideration is the outlook for oil prices. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the current level of oil prices will not be maintained and prices will fall to around US$45 per barrel in a year or so, broadly in line with market expectations. The rise to date has had a direct impact on CPI inflation in the September quarter, and it is likely that petrol will make a further significant contribution to CPI inflation in the near term. This is expected to keep year-ended CPI inflation above underlying inflation over the next few quarters, with the two measures converging thereafter. However, if oil prices are sustained at, or rise above, recent high levels, headline CPI inflation would be higher than currently forecast. This could also mean a greater potential for second-round effects, particularly given the strong conditions in labour and product markets. However, to the extent that higher oil prices persist and have a significant dampening impact on the global economy, they would also tend to reduce domestic growth and consequently place some downward pressure on underlying inflation. ", " Global foreign exchange market turnover rose sharply in the three years between <span class=\"no-wrap\">April 2001 and April 2004.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fna1\" id=\"ra1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup></span> In part this represented a return to more normal rates of activity from a subdued level of trading in 2001. At that time, the US dollar bubble was at its peak, and was associated with a buy-and-hold strategy toward US dollar denominated assets. The search for yield has also boosted general interest in foreign exchange as an asset class for investors, and the Australian dollar has benefited more than others, reflecting the positive yield differential available. Hence while turnover has risen noticeably in all markets and in all currencies, the rise in activity in both the Australian dollar and the Australian market was noticeably stronger than the global average. The valuation effects of the rise in the exchange rate from just under US50 cents in April 2001 to around US75 cents in April 2004 were also important in explaining the increase in turnover reported in US dollar terms. ", " The AUD/USD is now the fourth most traded currency pair in the world, with trading in the euro/USD the highest, followed by the yen/USD and pound sterling against the US dollar (Graph A1). Average daily global turnover of the Australian dollar against the US dollar has increased from US$47 billion to US$90 billion, which places the currency pair ahead of trading in other major currencies such as the Swiss franc and Canadian dollar against the US dollar. About one-third of this turnover in the Australian dollar occurred in Australia, with the rest spread across the major foreign exchange centres around the globe. ", " Total foreign exchange turnover in Australia (taking into account not only trading in Australian dollars but also other currencies) also recorded a substantial rise in total turnover in 2004, from US$52 billion per day in 2001 to US$81 billion (Table A1). On these figures the Australian market is the seventh largest in the world and the fourth largest in the Asia-Pacific region. ", " Turnover in the domestic market remains evenly divided between transactions involving the Australian dollar and those that do not. Of note is the increased turnover in trades involving the euro. This is in line with the growing importance of the euro in other major trading centres, and in part reflects that the euro was still a relatively new currency in 2001 but it has since gained more widespread acceptance. A greater commitment to the Australian market from several large European investment banks that trade out of Sydney has also boosted euro turnover in Australia. ", " Spot transactions in the foreign exchange market have risen by 93 per cent in Australia since the previous survey, while turnover in both forwards and foreign exchange swaps was up by 43 per cent. Transactions between resident dealers and overseas banks were one of the driving forces behind the rise. Anecdotal evidence gathered domestically, and supported by findings of other central banks, suggests that the increased participation of hedge funds may have been a major contributor to the rise in turnover. Hedge funds were increasingly noted as taking speculative positions in foreign exchange in recent years, and were also more active than previously in hedging their currency exposures on underlying investments. ", " The strong employment growth of recent years has seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.6 per cent, which is close to the previous lows of the past 25 years. While a low unemployment rate is generally indicative of relatively tight labour market conditions, it is not a definitive measure; labour scarcity will also depend on other factors such as the availability of existing workers to work more hours, the potential for people currently measured as outside the labour force to enter, and the extent of skill matching between the available supply and demand for labour. This box looks at a range of indicators of labour market conditions that take some of these factors into account. ", " One factor affecting the availability of labour that is not captured by the unemployment rate is the degree of underemployment, which refers to the willingness of employed people (both full-time and part-time) to work more than their current hours. This increased substantially during the early 1990s, with strong growth in part-time workers actively looking for additional work (Graph B1). There is also a significant number of underemployed full-time workers, though these have been more stable as a share of the labour force. Adding these two categories to the unemployment rate would produce a crude measure of underutilisation, but it would tend to be an overestimate because it is likely that an underemployed worker may want only a few extra hours of work each week, while an unemployed person may want full-time work. Instead, it makes sense to calculate an underutilisation measure by weighting each underutilised person by an estimate of the additional hours that they want to work (Graph B2). This measure is close to, but still above its previous cyclical lows, suggesting that the labour market may not currently be quite as tight as implied by the unemployment rate. ", " Another source of potential labour supply is the 35–40 per cent of the working-age population which is not measured as being in the labour force. Some proportion of these people report that they are willing to work but are not actively searching for work or are not available to start work immediately, and are known as ‘marginally attached workers’. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggest that marginally attached workers have increased as a proportion of the working-age population outside the labour force over the 1980s and early 1990s, and currently represent more than 20 per cent of this group. This increase has been associated with a trend decline in the participation of males.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnb1\" id=\"rb1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " It is not possible to predict how far the unemployment rate might be able to fall before tightness in the labour market leads to significantly stronger economy-wide wage pressures. For a number of reasons, it is possible that wage pressures are now lower at any given unemployment rate than they would have been in the past. First, there is the rise in underutilisation and marginally attached workers discussed above. Second, industrial relations reforms since the late 1980s have resulted in more decentralised wage-setting arrangements, limiting the extent to which wage pressures emerging in areas facing relatively tight labour market conditions are transmitted to other parts of the economy. A third, and reinforcing development is the trend towards longer-duration wage contracts, reflecting the anchoring of inflation expectations at a low level. ", " Nevertheless, business surveys suggest that a broad range of firms are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable labour (Graph B3). These survey-based indicators are likely to be influenced both by the overall quantity of labour supply and the extent to which the skills of available workers match the needs of employers. Both the NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys suggest that the difficulty in obtaining suitable labour has moved into the upper end of the range recorded over the past two decades.

Economic growth has remained moderate, but the data becoming available over the past couple of months have been firmer, on average, than those received during the second half of 1996. The outlook now is for stronger growth during 1997 than that experienced through 1996. ", " In underlying terms, inflation has now slowed from a rate of 3.3 per cent immediately before the easings to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span> at present. An important reason for the fall has been the significant appreciation of the Australian dollar during 1996. Although this represents only a ‘once-off’ effect, the near-term outlook is for a continued good inflation performance. ", " Recent developments in the two major components of private demand – private consumption and business fixed investment – have shown contrasting patterns. Retail spending slowed through 1996, culminating in a fall in the December quarter. This degree of weakness is unlikely to continue, and most retailers have reported a better start to the new year. Private investment, in contrast, particularly non-residential construction, has been very strong, and all indications are that it will remain so. At the same time, housing construction, which has been weak for around two years, is now starting to show the first signs of recovery in the form of increased loan and building approvals. ", " The labour market has been lacklustre for some time, as shown by an unemployment rate which has remained at about 8½ per cent. Employment growth has not been strong enough to eat into this, but the most recent two quarters were a good deal stronger than their predecessors, even without adjusting for apparent under-reporting. Although monthly numbers are extremely volatile, underlying employment growth seems to have picked up. The various measures of vacancies show a mixed picture, with some flat and some showing a tendency to increase recently. Consumer and business sentiment are well down from their recent peaks, but have stopped falling, and may be improving slightly. The fall in retail spending in the December quarter reduced confidence, but, on the other hand, the business surveys have tended to show slightly more confidence in their most recent observations. Both businesses and households are continuing to borrow at a solid rate, with all three major categories of credit – business, personal and mortgage lending – growing at about 10 per cent per annum. ", " A crucial condition for the sustainability of any expansion is that wage costs be contained. Excessive rises would lead to some combination of higher unemployment or higher inflation, depending on the degree of competition in the industry concerned. For this reason, the Bank has been conscious of the need to monitor closely the growth of wages and salaries in coming to its views on monetary policy. On average, results over 1996 have been satisfactory, although outcomes from enterprise bargaining in the private sector seem to be higher than aggregate inflation and productivity trends would sustainably permit. A rise in other types of wages, which pushed them near to the increases achieved in enterprise agreements, would lead to an aggregate wage outcome which was inconsistent with the inflation objective and so have implications for future monetary policy. ", " Given this assessment of the outlook for inflation and growth, and the uncertainties still surrounding wage outcomes, the Bank sees current monetary policy settings as broadly appropriate for the time being. ", " Information becoming available recently points to a somewhat stronger tone in economic activity than appeared to be the case for much of 1996. Construction continues to increase, with very strong spending on non-residential building and engineering construction likely to be joined soon by an upturn in house building. The demand for imports, particularly those types of imports used as inputs, seems to have firmed. The demand for labour also appears to be recovering, as evidenced by a resumption of employment growth and a lift in job vacancies. At the same time, indicators of business confidence and trading conditions have also improved a little. The main weak spot in demand has been consumption, which reflects some slowing in income growth and possibly some temporary caution occasioned by the weaker employment conditions earlier in 1996. The odds are, however, that consumption will strengthen somewhat in 1997. ", " Assessments of business conditions rely heavily on various surveys of business sentiment. The latest surveys, which were taken during the December quarter, suggest some improvement in economic activity in general occurred towards the end of 1996. In the National Australia Bank's Survey of Non-Farm Businesses, for example, there was a modest improvement in aggregate <em>business conditions</em> (Graph 1). This survey, like most others, was conducted largely before the most recent reduction in interest rates in December. Looking over the next year, firms have become a little more optimistic about sales growth, though responses on some other questions moved in the opposite direction. The most recent ABS Survey of Business Expectations also suggests firms expect relatively strong sales and profitability in early 1997; expectations over a 12-month horizon are little changed from the previous survey. ", " Conditions still vary considerably across industries. <em>Retailers</em> have found a difficult sales environment over recent months, as consumers reduced spending in the December quarter (consumer demand is discussed in detail below). Recent liaison information, however, suggests a better January and improved confidence about the outlook over the next year. ", " Conditions in <em>manufacturing</em> appear to have improved a little overall, with quite marked differences within the industry. According to the national accounts, total manufacturing output rose strongly in the September quarter with the growth concentrated in areas such as machinery and equipment, which is consistent with the growth in business investment spending. Exports of manufactured goods have also continued to record quite strong growth. ", " These data are by now rather old, but recent surveys of manufacturing firms suggest an improvement in conditions in the December quarter. The Colonial State Bank and Australian Chamber of Manufacturers surveys reported that a positive net balance of firms experienced an increase in production, the first positive net balances for about two years. Most respondents to the ACCI-Westpac survey expect conditions to improve in the March quarter. Data from the ABS on manufacturers' expectations of sales also point to further reasonable aggregate growth; the second estimate for 1996/97 is 5.7 per cent above last year's corresponding figure. These surveys also highlight the differences in prospects between different parts of manufacturing, with sales in the machinery and equipment sector expected to increase by 19.4 per cent, while elsewhere, sales are expected to rise by just 2.5 per cent. In some areas of manufacturing, particularly in those sectors not producing investment goods, stock levels may be a little high; as a result, stronger sales growth in these sectors may take some time to translate fully into higher production. ", " Looking at other sectors, the December quarter NAB survey reports that conditions improved in recreation, construction and transport. Some previously strong sectors, such as business and financial services and mining, reported a weakening. ", " Company <em>profitability</em> also varies by industry and along similar lines. The profitability of retailers has been constrained by sluggish demand. In a number of other industries, the impact of high wages growth in 1994 or international competition is keeping profits in check. Overall, the aggregate data suggest that profitability is a little lower than it was a couple of years ago. As a share of GDP, corporate gross operating surplus is around its average level for the past decade, after adjusting for newly privatised companies (Graph 2). In the September quarter, measured <span class=\"no-wrap\">profits (after interest)</span> appear to have been distorted by an increase in measured interest payments associated with the rotation of firms in the Company Profits Survey. In underlying terms, companies should benefit from recent falls in bank lending rates which should reduce their debt servicing burdens. ", " In the early years of the 1990s, the combination of reasonable levels of profitability and relatively low levels of investment allowed the corporate sector to restructure its <em>balance sheet</em>. This process now appears to be complete, with the debt-equity ratio of listed companies in 1995/96 increasing for the first time in five years. Ongoing investment growth implies that further rises in gearing are occurring. Business loan approvals remain at a high level. After allowing for the effect of recent privatisations, <em>business credit</em> grew at an annualised rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">9.4 per cent</span> in the six months to December 1996. For an economy recording 2 per cent inflation, this is a solid rate of growth. New equity raisings were strong in the month of December and may increase over the coming months as a result of the strong share market; nevertheless they remain a relatively minor source of corporate funding. ", " In the <em>Capital Expenditure Survey</em> conducted in October and November, investment expenditure in 1996/97 was estimated to be 19 per cent higher than the corresponding figure for 1995/96 (Graph 3). Growth of around this magnitude would take the ratio of private business fixed investment to nominal GDP to only slightly above its average level of the 1980s. Growth is expected to be concentrated in the mining, finance, property and business services and private-sector infrastructure sectors. Strong growth is also expected in the accommodation and sport and recreation industries; in contrast, firms in the manufacturing and wholesale trade industries are expecting relatively small increases in investment (Graphs 4 and 5). ", " Recent information supports, and if anything strengthens, the earlier picture that a very solid upswing in investment spending is under way. National accounts data for the September quarter show a rise of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> in business fixed investment, and an increase of 19 per cent over the year to September. <em>Plant and equipment</em> investment was stronger than suggested by imports of capital goods, reflecting a sharp run-down in wholesalers' stocks of machinery and equipment and an increase in domestic production. Data on imports of capital goods suggest that investment in plant and equipment may have been soft in the December quarter, but there seems little doubt that the trend in investment is quite clearly upward. ", " The stronger part of investment, however, is in <em>non-residential construction</em>, both building and engineering construction. <em>Private building approvals</em>, in value terms, rose further in the December quarter, to equal their peak in the late 1980s. There are a number of quite large projects now getting under way, including some related to the Olympics. <em>Engineering construction</em> is already well above its peak in the late 1980s and as a share of GDP is close to the peak of the early 1980s (Graph 6). This has been driven by a number of large private-sector infrastructure works, such as Victoria's Citylink road project as well as mining and resource-related developments. According to the Access Investment Monitor, resource-related projects under consideration have almost doubled over the past year to $35 billion. ", " The positive investment outlook reflects relatively optimistic expectations regarding the medium-term future of the Australian economy. Much of the investment is infrastructure related, or in the mining sector, and is not being undertaken solely in response to expected movements in the domestic business cycle. The investment is also being supported by relatively favourable financial conditions. While profitability has been squeezed in some areas, the share market has risen and company balance sheets are strong. Monetary policy settings are supportive of investment as well. Nominal lending rates are low by historical standards and ‘real’ rates, as conventionally measured, are only slightly higher than they were in the second half of 1993, when policy settings were designed to help stimulate a weak economy. ", " This upswing in business capital expenditure is likely soon to be augmented by dwelling investment, as evidence accumulates that the housing sector is in the early stages of an upturn (Graph 7). New <em>lending approvals</em> have picked up noticeably in recent months with growth in all categories of lending, but particularly for purchases of established and newly erected dwellings by owner occupiers. ", " As has been the case in past cycles, the lift in financing activity is starting to be reflected in local government <em>building approvals</em>, which have begun to increase. Data for November and December suggest that the rise is now spreading to approvals for houses, whereas earlier it was confined to approvals for multi-unit buildings. The number of commencements of new private dwellings, having fallen in the September quarter, is expected to have risen in the December quarter, and should continue to move ahead thereafter. ", " Here again, <em>financial conditions</em> are favourable for expansion. The recovery in loan approvals follows declines in mortgage interest rates in the second half of 1996 which, combined with relative stability in house prices, have improved the demand for housing. The CBA/HIA measure of housing affordability is at its highest recorded level, and the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Survey of <em>Consumer Sentiment</em> suggests that, at present, households regard it as a very good time to purchase a house. ", " Housing construction activity is also likely to be underpinned by the low rental vacancy rates of the past year, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. It is therefore apparent that conditions are right for a cyclical upswing in housing, though pockets of excess dwelling supply which persist in some regions will probably mean that in the short run, the pick-up may be more uneven, and overall not quite as strong, as those in the past. ", " Consumer demand was weak during the second half of 1996, with <em>retail trade</em> data showing no advance in retail spending over the second half of the year. In real terms, retail trade, as estimated by the ABS, fell by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> in the December quarter, to be largely unchanged from a year earlier (Graph 8). This occurred after quite a weak showing in the September quarter, when private consumption rose by 0.3 per cent according to the national accounts. The slowdown in consumption growth appears to be broadly based, with growth in expenditure on both goods and services declining. (One exception, largely in response to exchange rate-induced price falls, is purchases of household appliances, which in nominal terms have risen by around 10 per cent over the past year.) The overall weakness accords with indications from major retailers who, as noted above, reported difficult trading conditions in the second half of 1996. ", " The slowing in aggregate consumption growth comes after a period of several years during which consumption expenditure rose quite quickly, and if anything outpaced the rise in household income, with a concomitant fall in the saving ratio. That rise occurred during the period of stronger overall growth, and quite buoyant consumer sentiment. More recently, household income growth may have slowed a little. A more cautious attitude may also have prompted consumers to contain their spending. The generally pessimistic tone of public discussion about the course of the economy, especially the labour market, may have aroused concerns over the possibility of higher unemployment. There is some evidence for this in the question about unemployment asked of respondents to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute's Survey of <em>Consumer Sentiment</em>. ", " The slowing in consumption does not appear to be forced on households by immediate financial considerations. Household <em>balance sheets</em> remain in relatively good shape. Over the past year, households' net financial assets have increased faster than household disposable income; at the same time, the household sector's interest servicing burden has declined (Graph 9). Much of the increase in households' assets has been concentrated in holdings of managed funds, including superannuation, with around one-third of the total increase being accounted for by valuation effects arising from the strong share market. There also appears to be little reluctance amongst households, in aggregate, to take on more debt. Total consumer credit – that is, personal credit plus housing credit – grew at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over the six months to December. ", " It is likely that consumption growth will pick up to some extent in 1997. Reports from retailers suggest that sales since Christmas have been considerably stronger than in the second half of 1996. Firmer labour market conditions <span class=\"no-wrap\">(see below)</span> should also see household incomes and spending on a rising trend, with short-term uncertainties receding. ", " The strength of any such pick-up in consumption remains to be seen. To the extent that households may be increasing in a structural way the amount of savings they put aside from current income, of course, that can only be regarded as to the good of longer-term economic performance: Australia still suffers from a disturbing lack of saving. In recent years, household saving in particular has fallen to levels which are very low by the standards of other developed countries. Moderate, rather than strong, growth in consumption would be most appropriate over the coming year. ", " Conditions in the labour market have improved over recent months. According to the published labour force statistics, <em>employment</em> rose by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter, and by a further 0.4 per cent in the December quarter. This follows a period of virtually no growth in the first half of 1996. The rate of <em>unemployment</em>, at <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.6 per cent</span>, is little changed from levels over the past year or so. ", " The ABS has reported that the changes to methodology in the Labour Force Survey appear to have led to growth in employment being underestimated over recent months. A change in survey technique seems to have resulted in some individuals reporting that they are not in the labour force, when previously they would have reported that they were employed. Had the change in survey procedures not taken place, the ABS estimates that recorded employment growth would have been noticeably stronger over the past few months (Graph 10). Statistics adjusted for the changed survey technique yield annualised growth in the second half of 1996 of around 2½ per cent. ", " Other labour market indicators generally also show a firmer picture. The ABS measure of <em>job vacancies</em> increased by 7.9 per cent over the three months to November, with the bulk of the increase in private-sector vacancies. The ANZ Bank's measure fell by 2.9 per cent during the December quarter, but showed a marked rise in January. This series and the DEETYA skilled vacancies series, which have tended to be weak, are based solely on newspaper job advertisements, and may be more sensitive to reductions in advertising for public-sector positions than the ABS series. Overtime hours worked per employee increased over the three months to November, the first rise since the beginning of 1996. Consistent with this, data for average weekly earnings show an increase in overtime earnings in the December quarter. ", " The strong <em>productivity</em> growth evident in the initial stages of the recovery from the early 1990s recession has continued well into the expansion (Graph 11). Since the trough in output in mid 1991, private-sector labour productivity has grown at an average annual rate of 2 per cent, well above the productivity gains made during recovery from the early 1980s recession. On the most recent data, this shows no sign of slowing. Economy wide, labour productivity seems to be growing at a trend rate of around 1¾ per cent per annum. Strong investment growth and ongoing structural reform should contribute to further solid productivity gains, which are ultimately the underpinning for sustainable increases in real incomes. ", " Import volumes look to have increased by 4 per cent in the December quarter, after a decline of 0.6 per cent in the September quarter. There was a sharp rise (7 per cent) in imports of intermediate goods, while consumption imports weakened in line with softer demand. Imports of capital goods rose marginally (Graph 12). ", " Export growth picked up in the December quarter, following little growth in the previous two quarters. A sharp rise in manufactured and rural exports, with the latter reflecting shipments of the record wheat crop, were the main contributors to growth. In contrast, resource exports showed little growth through the second half of last year (Graph 13). ", " The <em>current account deficit</em> increased through the second half of 1996, from a low point of around 3½ per cent of GDP in the June quarter. By the end of 1996 it was running at about 4¼ per cent of GDP. This increase reflects a rise in both the goods and services and net income deficits. At least in part, the widening in the former reflects a fall in the terms of trade of around 1 per cent over the second half of 1996. ", " The Commonwealth Government's Mid-Year Review of the Budget showed a significant deterioration in the projected <em>budget deficit</em> for 1996/97 and subsequent years. In 1996/97, the underlying budget deficit is now expected to be $8.5 billion (1.7 per cent of GDP), an increase of $2.9 billion from the budget-time estimate. This deterioration largely reflects a shortfall in company tax revenue and a number of one-off payments. In subsequent years, the increase in the expected deficit primarily reflects the lowering in the Government's forecasts for wages growth and inflation, although a decline in the company tax base also has an effect. The lower wage and inflation forecasts reduce projected revenue collections, but have a smaller effect on projected outlays. As a result, on current policy assumptions, a budget surplus in underlying terms is now not anticipated until 1999/2000, a year later than previously expected. ", " Based on the Commonwealth's Mid-Year Review and ABS estimates, the underlying PSBR – that is, the PSBR adjusted for net advances – is estimated to be 1.7 per cent of GDP, compared with 1.2 per cent in 1995/96 and 2.0 per cent in 1994/95. The fiscal consolidation by the Commonwealth in 1996/97 is more than offset by a deterioration in both the State general government and PTE sectors. However, in the following year, Commonwealth fiscal consolidation is likely to see a sizeable improvement in the PSBR. ", " Financial intermediation is running at a pace consistent with steady economic growth. Over the second half of 1996, total credit extended by Australian financial institutions (adjusted to exclude the effects of privatisation activity on the business credit component) grew at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span>. Growth was broadly similar across the major components. ", " Intermediaries funded this expansion through both domestic raisings of funds and off-shore borrowing. Broad money – a measure of the public's holdings of the liabilities of intermediaries – grew at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over this period. The public's demand for currency, in contrast, grew only slowly at an annual rate of just above 2 per cent over the second half of 1996. This may be associated with subdued consumer spending. ", " <em>Ordinary-time earnings of adults working full time</em> (AWOTE) increased by 1.2 per cent during the three months to November 1996, and by 3.9 per cent over the year (Graph 14). A break down of this relatively high quarterly result into earnings in the private and public sector is not yet available. This information is more than usually important at present, because over recent quarters there has been a substantial pick-up in measured earnings in the public sector. Over the year to August, public-sector AWOTE rose by 5.5 per cent; in the six-month period ended August, it rose at an annual rate in excess of 8 per cent. In the private sector, by contrast, AWOTE has grown more slowly, and in August was only about 3½ per cent higher than a year earlier. ", " The strength of public-sector AWOTE is unusual, in light of the fact that the coverage of enterprise bargains in the public sector is very wide, and the bulk of enterprise bargains struck are delivering increases of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> per annum. A possible explanation may be compositional change within the public sector, if declines in public-sector employment have been concentrated amongst people on below-average earnings. If measures of public-sector wages are being distorted at present, and if this is affecting the overall wage measures, then it may not be appropriate to draw firm conclusions from the strong growth in AWOTE over recent quarters. ", " That said, some important issues remain unresolved in the debate over wages. There is considerable variation in growth in wages between different segments of the labour market. Award rates of pay have risen by much less than average earnings, while the rate of wage rises negotiated in new enterprise agreements remains high (though these statistics are now dated). Annualised wage rises in new enterprise agreements in the September quarter averaged 4.8 per cent, similar to the outcome recorded in the June quarter (Graph 15). In the private sector, annualised wage rises in new agreements averaged 5.3 per cent in both the June and September quarters. Growth in executive salaries, meanwhile, remains even faster. The Cullen Egan Dell survey of skilled employees reported that executive salaries grew by 6 per cent over the year to the December quarter, little changed from rates in 1995. Growth in non-executive salaries in this survey appears to have stabilised at around 4½ per cent. ", " The considerable dispersion in wage rises currently seen in the economy can create pressures for ‘catch up’ in an effort to restore earlier relativities. The ACTU's Living Wage claim is a clear example. The claim seeks an increase in minimum award wages of 8.75 per cent over the next year and 30 per cent over the next three years. The Bank's estimate is that if the first stage of the claim were to be granted in full, the direct effect would be to contribute an additional 1.6 percentage points to aggregate wage growth. This assumes, perhaps unrealistically, that there would be no flow-on effects to higher-paid workers. Such a large increase in minimum award wages could well generate pressure for increased wages elsewhere in the labour market, leading to an even more substantial rise in aggregate wage growth. It would also, almost certainly, adversely affect employment prospects, particularly for relatively unskilled workers. ", " In <em>underlying</em> terms, consumer prices increased by 0.4 per cent in the December quarter 1996, and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span> over the year (Graph 16). This compares with an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in September. ", " The <em>headline</em> CPI rose by 0.2 per cent in the quarter, bringing the year-ended inflation rate to 1.5 per cent, down from 2.1 per cent in the September quarter and well down from its recent peak of 5.1 per cent in the December quarter 1995. The falls in mortgage interest rates announced in June and August subtracted 0.5 of a percentage point from the quarterly CPI result. ", " Broader national accounts measures confirm that annual rates of inflation are decelerating. Over the year to September, the fixed-weight deflator for private consumption rose by only 1.4 per cent, while that for GDP rose by 1.7 per cent, both substantially smaller rises than a year earlier. ", " Sectoral differences in price movements confirm an important role for the exchange rate, but also point to a more broadly based easing of inflationary pressure. Final retail prices of <em>imports</em> have been falling. In addition to this, falling input prices, weaker than expected sales and intense domestic competition have helped contain the growth in <em>goods</em> prices more generally. Services price inflation is also abating. ", " Continued weakness in <em>wholesale</em> prices suggests that consumer price inflation will remain subdued in coming quarters (Graph 17). Although the prices of raw materials strengthened slightly in recent months, they remain well down on levels of a year ago. The prices of most other domestic and imported inputs have been flat or falling for the past year. In addition, the wholesale prices of final imports continue to fall, reducing the pricing power of domestic producers. Reflecting lower non-labour input costs, and increased competition, the price of domestically produced final manufactured goods rose by only 0.5 per cent over the year to November. ", " In recent months there has been a reduction in inflation expectations of both producers and financial markets, influenced by the recent falls in inflation. ", " In the near term, business surveys point to continued weak growth in selling prices (Graph 18). A net balance of 11 per cent of respondents to the latest ACCI-Westpac survey recorded falling selling prices in the December quarter, continuing the pattern of unrealised expectations that has become evident over the past year. For the March quarter, expectations fell once again. The ABS survey also suggests continuing low price pressures; selling prices are expected to rise by just 0.1 per cent in the March quarter, the lowest recorded quarterly expectation for this survey. Over the coming year, a rise of only 0.9 per cent is expected. Respondents to the latest <span class=\"no-wrap\">NAB survey</span> expect a rise of 0.4 per cent in the March quarter. There also appears to have been some decline in consumers' inflation expectations as measured by the Melbourne Institute. ", " Financial market participants have also lowered their expectations. The gap between the yield on indexed and conventional bonds fell in the December quarter. Currently it suggests that investors in bond markets in Australia expect inflation to average around 3 per cent over the next decade. This has fallen from around 3½ per cent in the middle of last year and 5 per cent in mid 1994. Financial market economists, surveyed by the Bank in February, have lowered their median forecasts for <em>underlying</em> inflation over the year to June 1997 to 1.9 per cent, down from 2.2 per cent in the previous survey. The median forecast for <em>headline</em> inflation over the year to June 1997 is 0.8 per cent, down sharply from 1.8 per cent in the previous survey due to the recent round of mortgage interest rate reductions. Looking further ahead, the median forecast for underlying inflation over the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">June 1998</span> is 2.6 per cent, with headline inflation expected to be slightly higher (Graph 19). ", " Longer-run inflation expectations are also declining, though further adjustment is required. In recent quarters, the NAB survey has reported that the proportion of producers who expect inflation to exceed 4 per cent for the remainder of the decade has fallen sharply. While this is encouraging, the majority of producers still expect inflation in the remainder of the decade to average between 3 and 4 per cent; that is, clearly above the Bank's target of 2–3 per cent. ", " In the near term, the Bank expects the recent good performance on inflation to be maintained. This reflects the continuation of influences which are already at work. With the trade-weighted exchange rate around its current level, the effects of the appreciation of the currency during 1996 will continue to be felt for some time yet. The moderate average wages growth over recent quarters will also be beneficial. In the very short term, sluggish consumer demand may also exert an unusually high degree of price discipline on retailers, though this weakness in spending will most likely pass as 1997 progresses. On current indications, barring unforseen changes in the exchange rate or labour costs, underlying inflation could be maintained around 2 per cent during 1997. At this point, the Bank expects inflation to be in the 2–3 per cent range in 1998. ", " Headline inflation will remain clearly below the underlying rate for the next few quarters. Reductions in mortgage interest rates and credit charges will continue to detract substantially from headline inflation in the March and June quarters, and the annual headline rate should fall to around 1 per cent, possibly even a little less, by mid 1997. This may help cement the reduction in inflation expectations. Should this also lower the starting point for wage negotiations, it would help to generate an environment in which low rates of inflation could be combined with improved economic growth for an extended period. ", " The main uncertainty to the outlook for inflation (and for employment) remains labour costs. Specifically, has the period of labour-market weakness, particularly in the first half of 1996, set in train any downward pressure on the size of wage increases obtained in enterprise agreements? Will the pace of ‘safety-net’ increases, which have been running at 1½ to 2 per cent over recent years, pick up as a result of the current wage case, and if so by how much? ", " To provide room for faster employment growth with good control over inflation, some moderation in wage increases given in enterprise agreements, and prudence in adjusting minimum wages, are two very important ingredients. ", " The international economic situation provides a good, but not particularly stimulating, environment for the Australian economy. Amongst the major countries, industrial output has picked up over recent months, and this has lifted base metal prices. GDP growth amongst the OECD group of countries is expected to be about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> in 1997, about the same as 1996. The IMF is presently forecasting growth in world output, which includes the faster-growing Asian region, of around 4 per cent. This global growth should support most commodity prices and demand for Australian exports as well as underpin a reasonable level of business confidence. ", " Conditions vary considerably across the major economies. After six years of growth, the US economy continues to expand solidly, and growth around trend is expected over the coming year. In Japan, despite some encouraging signs, growth has been uneven and confidence is at a low ebb. While the depreciation of the yen should help support activity, the approaching fiscal consolidation and depressed share prices are working in the other direction. Elsewhere in Asia, growth prospects appear to be improving in response to easier monetary conditions and a recovery in the world electronics market. In Europe, growth remains relatively slow, with structural rigidities and fiscal consolidation programs weighing on the expansion. ", " Inflation in the industrialised economies remains unusually subdued. The price environment, while reflecting to some extent the slightly weaker nature overall of the present expansion compared with those in the past, bodes well for its longevity. ", " The United States economy continues to perform well, with solid output growth and subdued inflation <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 20)</span>. Real GDP rose by 1.2 per cent in the December quarter reflecting stronger consumption and net exports. Strong investment has meant that despite industrial production continuing to grow at a healthy pace, capacity utilisation remains below the high levels of early 1995. Solid growth in output is ensuring continuing employment growth, with the level of employment increasing by 2.5 per cent over the year to January. <span class=\"no-wrap\">The unemployment</span> rate is currently 5.4 per cent, down slightly on the level a year ago. ", " The tight labour market is putting some upward pressure on wages. Over the year to the December quarter, average hourly wages increased by 3.4 per cent, the highest outcome for six years. Despite this, broader measures of labour cost growth show little sign of a pick-up, as continuing rationalisation of the health insurance industry is reducing growth in non-wage costs; over the year to the December quarter, the Employment Cost Index rose by 2.9 per cent. The moderate labour cost increases are helping sustain low inflation. Core consumer prices rose by 2.6 per cent over the year to December, while core producer prices rose by just 0.6 per cent. Headline measures of inflation have been somewhat higher, primarily as a consequence of relatively large increases in energy and food prices. There is, however, little sign as yet that these price increases are flowing through into more general pressure on prices. ", " Recent indicators of the Japanese economy suggest some pick-up in the pace of growth after a flat spot in the middle of 1996 (Graph 21). Current assessments are complicated, however, by the possibility that expenditure by consumers and businesses is being brought forward in response to an announced increase in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">value-added</span> tax (VAT) to take place in April. The recent strength of purchases of passenger motor vehicles and other consumer durables, and orders of industrial machinery, have been widely attributed to this future increase in tax. Thus, while stronger demand has led to industrial production recording solid rises over recent months, this has not helped confidence. ", " The Bank of Japan's November <em>Tankan</em> survey reported only a relatively small improvement in business sentiment, and employment has fallen in recent months. The unemployment rate, at 3.3 per cent in December, is close to its post-war peak. Not surprisingly, there are no inflationary pressures; core consumer prices increased by 0.3 per cent over the year to December. ", " Looking forward, the recent depreciation of the yen has improved prospects for the Japanese economy, and the external sector may make a significant positive contribution to GDP growth in 1997. Continuing low interest rates should help support aggregate demand. The fall in the share market and the impending fiscal consolidation, however, may exert dampening influences. ", " Elsewhere in Asia, growth has generally eased over the past year (Table 4). This reflects the combined effects of weak global demand for electronics products, a tightening of monetary conditions in 1995 and exchange rate appreciations in several countries. There are, however, tentative signs that growth will pick-up in 1997, with China again likely to lead the region. Stronger industrial production in the industrialised countries, recent monetary policy easings and a run down in stocks of electronics products are favourable cyclical influences in a number of countries. ", " In <em>South Korea</em> – Australia's second largest merchandise export destination – growth slowed significantly in 1996. Export growth has moderated and the subsequent reduction in profits has adversely affected manufacturing investment. Large wage rises and labour-market unrest are also having adverse effects. In contrast, output growth in <em>China</em> remains robust, despite a modest slowing as firms run down excessive inventories, and the <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>Hong Kong</em></span> economy appears to be recovering, with firming business and consumer confidence reflected in stronger indicators of economic activity. ", " In the South-East Asian economies, the overheating pressures which were evident in 1995 are receding. In <em>Indonesia</em>, <em>Thailand</em> and <em>Malaysia</em> growth remains firm, albeit a little weaker than a year earlier. In <em>Singapore</em>, continued weakness in manufacturing output and exports slowed growth to only a little above 3 per cent over the year to September. ", " In New Zealand, the pace of growth remains relatively subdued, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand forecasting growth of 1.3 per cent over the year to March 1997. The underlying inflation rate over the year to December was 2.4 per cent; it is expected to decline over the course of 1997. ", " Economic activity in the major European economies has continued to expand, but rather slowly, and the recovery lacks momentum. Across the region growth is being encouraged by quite low real interest rates and more competitive exchange rates which have seen solid rises in foreign demand. The recovery continues to be hampered, however, by low consumer and business confidence, in part because of the anticipated effects of ongoing regional fiscal consolidation. Despite these factors, the OECD forecasts GDP in the European Union to rise by 2.4 per cent in 1997, up from an estimated 1.6 per cent in 1996. ", " In <em>Germany</em>, GDP rose by 0.8 per cent in the September quarter with much of the growth coming from net exports, and only a small contribution from domestic demand (Graph 22). This pattern appears to have continued into the December quarter. Industrial production has been soft with output little changed from the September quarter. Manufacturers' domestic orders have shown continued weakness; foreign demand, in contrast, has been rising strongly. The unemployment rate stood at 11.3 per cent in January, the highest level since reunification. Over the year to December, the underlying inflation rate was 1.5 per cent. ", " Activity in the other major continental economies remains mixed. In <em>France</em> and <em>Italy</em>, growth is weak. In contrast, growth has picked up in the <em>United Kingdom</em> and the smaller economies of <em>Ireland</em>, <em>Spain</em>, <em>Denmark</em> and <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>The Netherlands</em></span>. ", " Inflation remains subdued throughout continental Europe, prompting official interest rates to be cut in <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>France, Italy, Spain</em></span> and <em>Sweden</em>. In the <em>United Kingdom</em>, above-trend growth and concerns about the re-emergence of inflationary pressures saw the Bank of England increase official interest rates by 25 basis points in October to 6 per cent. ", " The pick-up in OECD industrial production is supporting base metal prices, after a period of weakness. Over the three months to January, the Bank's Base Metals Index rose 15.1 per cent, driven largely by increases in the prices of aluminium and copper (Graph 23). Oil prices also rose through the December quarter and into January, supported by low stockpiles and a cold northern-hemisphere winter. In the month of January, the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate averaged $US25.18, up about 14 per cent on the average level in 1996. ", " In contrast, some other major commodity prices have shown weakness in recent months. The price of gold fell by $US14 per ounce through the December quarter, and continued to fall in January; it currently stands around <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> below its December quarter average. The outlook for bulk commodity prices is mixed. The annual contract price negotiations with Japanese producers have resulted in a fall in coking coal prices of $US1 per tonne (2 per cent); thermal coal prices have fallen by around 7 per cent. For iron ore, negotiations have been completed with a small overall price increase; fine ore prices rose by 1 per cent with no change in the price of lump ore. Export volumes have been maintained. ", " The Bank's Commodity Price Index (in SDRs) rose by 0.6 per cent over the three months to January; in terms of US dollars, the Index fell by 0.6 per cent. The effects of falls in the prices of gold, beef and wheat were offset by increases in the prices of oil, wool and base metals. ", " The two easings of monetary policy during the December quarter brought the total reduction in cash rates over the second half of 1996 to 1.5 percentage points (Graph 24). Prior to that, cash rates had been unchanged since late 1994. ", " While both the July and November easings took place the morning after a Board meeting, the December easing followed some time after that month's Board meeting, as has been the case in around half of the 21 policy changes that have been announced since 1990. ", " In timing the implementation of its policy decisions, the Bank takes into account a wide range of factors, including the state of financial markets. Given the volatility of the foreign exchange market at the time of the December Board meeting, which included a fall in the exchange rate of about US3 cents overnight, the Bank felt that it would have been inappropriate to reduce interest rates, and deferred the change until later in the month when market conditions had settled somewhat. ", " Notwithstanding the volatility in the exchange rate in early December, financial markets overall responded well to the easings of monetary policy over the second half of 1996. The reduction in overnight rates reflected fully in yields along the entire yield curve out to 10 years. That is, the curve moved down in parallel over the half year, an indication that capital markets viewed the easings as fully justified by the inflationary outlook. The exchange rate over the half year showed little net change in trade-weighted terms, though it fell somewhat against a stronger US dollar. ", " Overall, Australian financial markets ended 1996 on a good note. Bond yields were close to their lows of the past quarter century; the share market was at record levels; and the exchange rate was around its average of the past decade. This reflected generally favourable economic circumstances as the economy notched up its fifth year of economic expansion and low inflation. Bullish sentiment on world financial markets provided a supportive backdrop, a development which owed importantly to the success of the Federal Reserve in maintaining the US economy on a relatively stable growth path, with full employment and low inflation. ", " With the US economy relatively well balanced, variability in US bond yields over the second half of 1996 was not high by past standards. Yields had risen in the first half of the year as a run of strong data engendered expectations of an imminent tightening by the Fed. With the pace of expansion slowing in the September quarter, some of this rise in yields was reversed, though as it became clear that this slowing was only temporary, bond yields subsequently rose back towards their mid 1996 highs. Over the past six months, therefore, there was little net change (Graph 25). ", " While the records of the Federal Open Market Committee show that, by mid year, the Fed had become more concerned about the emergence of inflationary pressures, it did not feel that they were yet sufficient to justify a tightening at that stage, particularly as growth in the economy was expected to slow of its own accord. US monetary policy has remained steady since January 1996, with cash rates at 5.25 per cent, though the Fed has maintained a bias towards tightening since the middle of 1996. ", " While US bond yields were broadly unchanged over the second half of 1996, those in Japan, where a large amount of excess capacity remains in the economy, fell by three-quarters of a percentage point, to an all-time low of 2.4 per cent. Expectations of a rise in Japanese official interest rates, which have been at a record low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span> since mid 1995, have been pushed back further. ", " In Europe, German bond yields also fell by about three-quarters of a percentage point as it became clear that the economic recovery remained sluggish. Reflecting a combination of subdued economic activity and falling inflation, there were widespread easings of monetary policy throughout Europe over the second half of 1996, including in Germany. The biggest falls in bond yields were in what are sometimes known as the ‘peripheral economies’, such as Italy and Spain. Both these countries experienced reductions in bond yields of about 2 percentage points over the second half of 1996, which saw their differentials to Germany contract sharply. Very large gains on inflation and reductions in fiscal deficits, as attempts were made to meet criteria for European Monetary Union, were the main factors allowing bond yields in these countries to fall. ", " Improved inflation and a much better fiscal position also played a large role in the Australian bond market, where yields fell by about 1.5 percentage points over the half year. The recent improvement in the Australian bond market dates from April 1996, when better news of inflation and fiscal policy began to emerge. ", " Reflecting these forces, the spread between Australian bond yields and US bond yields narrowed over 1996 from 250 points at the start of the year, to 200 points mid year, and 80 points recently. This has brought Australian bond yields to around par with those in the UK and New Zealand, though they remain 80 points above those in Canada. This latter spread can be largely explained by significantly weaker economic activity in Canada, and its lower inflation rate. ", " The low level of world bond yields has provided a solid underpinning to share markets, as they have induced investors to accept lower earnings yields on their shares (ie high price/earnings ratios). The pace in share markets continues to be set by the US, where shares are benefiting from not only low bond yields but from continuing high levels of profitability and a strong trend by households towards investment in equity mutual funds. Inflows to these funds totalled <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$225 billion</span> in 1996, <span class=\"no-wrap\">70 per cent</span> higher than in the previous year. This combination of forces has seen the US share market rise in value by <span class=\"no-wrap\">75 per cent</span> since the start of 1995. ", " This rise has lifted share prices to levels which few professional investors regard as good value. An increase of this size over a two-year period has been rare, having been achieved only twice previously in the post-war period. One was in the lead up to the 1987 share market crash; the other was in the mid 1950s. While in late 1996, the market dipped noticeably on Fed Chairman Greenspan's comments about the level of the share market, it subsequently rebounded to new records in January 1997 as inflows to mutual funds remained robust. ", " Share markets in most other developed countries have shown more moderate, though still sizeable, increases over the past couple of years (Graph 26). Typically, increases have been in the range of 30–40 per cent. The Australian share market has participated in this upward trend, although it has tended to rise at a rate a little below the average of other industrial countries; it has increased by about 25 per cent over the past couple of years. The resources sector in particular has lagged, though there has also been disappointment with profits of some industrial stocks. ", " The exception in share markets is Japan, where share prices have fallen by about 15 per cent since late 1996, taking them back to levels of late 1995. This fall took place despite the fact that the Japanese economy recorded solid growth in 1996, helped by low interest rates and a weakening yen. It seems that what is worrying the share market is the outlook for economic growth in the year ahead. Specifically, there are concerns that the scheduled increase in the consumption tax from 3 per cent to 5 per cent on 1 April, as well as more general fiscal consolidation, will undermine economic growth. ", " Other Asian share markets have generally recovered in recent months, after a setback in mid year associated with slowing regional growth. Share markets in South Korea and Thailand, however, have continued to fall sharply on a combination of slower growth, growing current account deficits and domestic problems. Share markets in China experienced a good deal of turbulence towards the end of the year, but appear to have stabilised in recent weeks. ", " There has been a major re-alignment of exchange rates between the US, Japan and Germany over recent months, with the US dollar rising strongly, particularly against the yen which has weakened against all currencies <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 27)</span>. These movements seem to be a belated recognition by markets of the very different economic circumstances of these three economies. There also appears to have been a change in view about currencies among the authorities in the major countries, with all, including the US, supporting the recent strengthening in the US dollar. ", " The exchange rate of the US dollar against the yen has moved in a very large range over the past three years. From a level of about 120 in early 1993, it fell to a low of around 80 in mid 1995, only to return to above <span class=\"no-wrap\">120 recently</span>. The fall in the period to 1995 was clearly a case of market overshooting, and no doubt added to the difficulties faced by Japan in recovering from the collapse of the asset-price bubble in the early 1990s. ", " The weakening of the yen over the past 18 months or so is part of the transmission process of the very easy monetary policy being followed by the Japanese authorities. There are signs that the recent move of the exchange rate back to 120 is helping the recovery process, with Japanese industrial production, and exports in particular, rising quite solidly in late 1996. ", " To this extent, the easy monetary policy is achieving its objectives, but one of its side effects has been to inflate asset markets in other countries. Japanese households were the first to respond to very low domestic interest rates by increasing investment abroad. More recently, there have been increasing signs of Japanese institutions diverting their investments offshore. This group had suffered substantial foreign exchange losses in the early 1990s and, for a time, were reticent in undertaking offshore investment again. Some international investors have also taken advantage of low Japanese interest rates to leverage asset purchases in other countries; hedge funds are said to have actively pursued this strategy. ", " The implications for the Australian dollar of these re-alignments of major currencies have been mixed. Through the second half of 1995 and most of 1996, it worked to push up the Australian dollar, as there were heavy inflows from Japan into Australian investments. Australia received a particularly large share of the Japanese retail offshore investment noted above. This spurred the issue of large amounts of dual currency ($A/yen) bonds to satisfy this demand. ", " The combination of strong inflows from Japan and a general improvement in sentiment towards the Australian dollar by international funds managers as the world economic outlook improved, saw the Australian dollar rise strongly over the course of 1996. From around US74 cents early in the year, it rose to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">US79–80 cents</span> in the second quarter. It then remained broadly in this range through to late in the year, apart from a spike up to US82 cents in early December. ", " Since then, the Australian dollar has weakened noticeably against the US dollar, falling back to under <span class=\"no-wrap\">US77 cents</span> (Graph 28). Initially, this was due to reductions in Australian interest rates, which narrowed the extent to which interest differentials favoured Australia. As a result, there has been a noticeable slowing in capital inflows from Japan in recent months, with flows from that country being diverted more to the US and the UK where interest rate increases are expected (Graph 29). Expectations of further interest rate cuts kept the exchange rate under downward pressure through the first half of January, even though these expectations seemed to be supported at times largely by rumours. More recently, a slightly stronger tone in the economic data has seen these expectations recede a little, though the exchange rate against the US dollar has slipped lower, due mainly to the strength of the latter. ", " Notwithstanding the recent fall against the US dollar, which has taken the exchange rate back to its level around the end of the first quarter of 1996, the trade-weighted index has fallen by only a relatively small amount. Overall, the trade-weighted index remains around the level which has prevailed since April 1996. ", " The Bank used the strength of the exchange rate over 1996 to buy back some of the foreign currency reserves it had sold in the early 1990s in support of the exchange rate. Over the course of 1996, purchases of foreign exchange totalled $11.6 billion, with about $4 billion of this being undertaken in the December quarter. Some of the year's purchases ($3.7 billion) were used to meet the Government's regular foreign exchange needs. The rest were applied to reducing outstanding foreign currency swaps which had been built up to fund the early 1990s sales of foreign exchange. ", " As was the case with the July easing, both easings in the December quarter were fully passed on, with a lag, by financial intermediaries to interest rates charged on variable rate housing and business loans. The predominant standard variable rate on housing loans is now 8.25 per cent, its lowest level since June 1974. The small business indicator rate has been reduced to 9.75 per cent, and the large business indicator rate is 9.3 per cent (Graph 30). ", " The reductions in these rates in the second half of 1996 reversed most of the increases in business lending rates that took place following the 1994 tightening of monetary policy, even though cash rates in late 1994 were increased by more than they have fallen recently (2.75 per cent against 1.5 per cent). In 1994, banks were able to hold the increase in indicator rates below the rise in cash rates because deposit costs increased significantly less than cash rates. In the case of housing loans, the 1994 increases have been more than reversed, reflecting the additional reduction in these interest rates in June 1996 which was related to increased competition from non-banks rather than a change in monetary policy (Table 6). ", " While the 1996 reductions in the cash rate were fully reflected in lower indicator lending rates, the time taken to pass the changes through to borrowers has been generally longer than the response to the 1994 tightenings. This is particularly the case for existing housing loans, where the average lag in 1996 between the time of the monetary policy announcements and the reductions in housing loan rates becoming effective was around <span class=\"no-wrap\">6–7 weeks</span>, compared with about 2 weeks when banks raised rates in 1994 (Table 7). This lag was also much longer than the lag for new borrowers, for whom the reduced housing loan rates became effective within a week. The implementation lags for new and existing small business borrowers (around 5–6 weeks) and large businesses (around 3–4 weeks) were also longer than the lags in 1994.

The March quarter CPI result confirms that underlying inflation has returned to an annual rate of close to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, and the prospects of inflation remaining low in the near future appear to be good. With some surplus capacity existing there is scope for the economy to grow more quickly in 1997 without generating significant inflationary pressures, provided growth in labour costs is not excessive. ", " So far in 1997 there have already been some indications that the pace of growth is picking up, particularly in areas of construction investment, housing and consumer spending. Growth is being supported by several factors including the effect of the three policy easings in the second half of 1996, which brought cash rates down by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ percentage points</span>. The impact of those cash rate reductions on home mortgage borrowers has been reinforced by a significant compression of intermediaries' interest margins in that area. The lower interest rates now in place should be supportive of interest-sensitive areas of activity, particularly housing and non-residential construction, as well as helping household and business cash flows. Other factors favourable to growth at present include the strong US economy, moderately rising commodity prices, and an historically good level of business profitability in many industries. ", " Conditions in the manufacturing sector have been an exception to this generally firmer picture, with profitability under pressure and investment intentions declining. The pressure on profitability reflects a combination of rising wage costs and flat selling prices, which continue to be constrained in many parts of the manufacturing sector by strong international competition. With the exchange rate having risen in trade-weighted terms, pressures on competitiveness have intensified during the past year. Looking ahead, however, a number of areas of domestic manufacturing are likely to benefit from the expansion in housing and non-residential construction now under way. ", " Employment growth has lagged behind the overall pace of economic activity. Total employment has been growing at a rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> in the past year, concentrated in part-time jobs. Nonetheless, the number of job vacancies has increased and employment can be expected to strengthen as the general pace of activity picks up over the course of the year. ", " The favourable near-term outlook for inflation is being underpinned by continued help from the exchange rate in holding down import prices. Also helpful to the outlook is the result of the recent Safety-Net Review by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which delivered only moderate increases in award wages. However, other developments in labour costs are of more concern for the longer-term inflation outlook. Wage increases under enterprise bargaining continue to be in the 4 to 5 per cent range, figures which appear high in a climate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> inflation and <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span> unemployment. Aggregate wages data, which encompass workers on award wages, enterprise agreements and other bargaining arrangements, suggest that the overall pace of wages growth has picked up recently. These figures will need to be closely watched to assess the extent to which they represent a significant change in trend but, taken at face value, they suggest that wages growth is becoming uncomfortably high. ", " The capacity of the economy to grow faster while maintaining low inflation will depend importantly on the future behaviour of wages. A significant acceleration of aggregate wages in response to stronger economic growth would directly curtail job creation. It would also threaten faster inflation – to which monetary policy would have to respond – and thereby put at risk the potential for faster non-inflationary growth. Lessening of wages growth would, on the other hand, enable faster growth without risk of acceleration in inflation. ", " While potential wages developments are a source of longer-term uncertainty for the inflation outlook, the immediate prospects are that inflation will remain low. The Bank's assessment is that the current level of cash rates is accommodating the pick-up in activity without prejudicing continued low inflation. ", " The economy is now in its sixth year of expansion since the recovery from recession began in 1991. After a period of slower growth during 1996, there are a number of indications that the pace of growth is picking up. Non-residential construction activity is increasing, and forward indicators of activity in that sector point to the prospect of further growth ahead. The housing cycle is also moving into an upward phase, while the latest indicators of consumer spending point to some rebound from the weakness experienced in the second half <span class=\"no-wrap\">of 1996</span>. At the same time, there remain a number of weak spots. Employment growth during the past year has been only moderate, and remains less than trend labour-force growth. Full-time employment has been flat. There are also areas of weakness in the outlook for business equipment investment, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The prospects, however, are that the labour market and conditions in manufacturing will strengthen in the year ahead as the general pace of activity picks up. ", " Growth of non-farm GDP in 1996 was somewhat below trend, coming in at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.8 per cent</span> for the year to the December quarter (Graph 1); growth of total GDP over the year was <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.1 per cent</span>. Although the quarterly pattern has been quite uneven, and often difficult to interpret, the estimates suggest that growth was slower in the second half of the year, at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. Slower growth in 1996 largely reflected a slowing in consumer spending which, in turn, was probably related to weaker employment growth during the year. The effect of this weakness in the consumer sector on overall activity was, to some extent, offset by robust growth in business investment. ", " Viewed from a longer-term perspective, a mild slowing of growth within the course of a longer period of expansion is not unusual. Each of the periods of economic expansion in the past couple of decades included a noticeable episode of mid-term slowing. In 1985/86, for example, non-farm GDP did not grow at all for a period of about a year before growth resumed and falls in unemployment recommenced. The current recovery to date has been of intermediate pace between the recoveries of the past two decades, and it has some way to run before exceeding the duration of those earlier recoveries (<a href=\"#box-1\">Box 1</a>). ", " Strong growth in business investment has occurred in most sectors of the economy during the past year. At an aggregate level, business investment grew by 21 per cent in real terms over the year to the December quarter, with growth strong in both the equipment and construction components. The ongoing recovery in investment has lifted investment spending as a share of nominal GDP well above the 1991 trough, to levels that are close to the averages of the past decade; it remains well below the peaks reached in the late 1980s (Graph 2), so that there is room for further expansion. ", " In the construction sector, the expansion currently under way is much more broadly based than was the case in the late 1980s investment boom, which was heavily concentrated in city office development. Much of the current strength in construction activity is coming from engineering construction – infrastructure, mines and so on – while non-residential building activity is quite broadly based across office, hotel, retailing and other developments. The prospects are good, therefore, for the expansion to continue without developing the sorts of imbalances that emerged in the late 1980s. A rapid rise in the backlog of <em>work yet to be done</em> on projects commenced suggests a continuing strong outlook for engineering construction activity in the year ahead (Graph 3). The same is true, to a lesser extent, for non-residential building projects, and is confirmed by the recent high levels of building approvals. ", " Broader indicators of investment intentions also point to further growth although the picture is somewhat uneven across industries. The Capital Expenditure Survey conducted in January and February provides estimates of aggregate business investment intentions for the remainder of 1996/97 and an initial reading on intentions <span class=\"no-wrap\">for 1997/98</span>. In the near term, the survey points to continuing strength in aggregate investment, broadly confirming earlier estimates. The estimates for 1997/98 present a more mixed picture, and it needs to be kept in mind that these initial intentions can be subject to substantial revision. Aggregate investment intentions for 1997/98 are <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> above the corresponding estimate a year earlier, but with some sharp contrasts between the major components (Table 1). Growth of investment in buildings and structures is expected to accelerate further, while expected investment in plant and equipment is lower than a year ago. Much of that weakness is concentrated in manufacturing, with most other industries expecting solid growth. Investment intentions in the mining, finance and property and business services sectors are particularly strong. ", " Other recent information confirms this general picture. The Access Investment Monitor for the December quarter identifies projects under consideration worth $67 billion, an increase of <span class=\"no-wrap\">32 per cent</span> on a year earlier, with strength concentrated in mining and in resource-related manufacturing projects. Investment in other parts of the manufacturing sector looks quite sluggish. The National Australia Bank's business survey also points to a continuation of relatively strong investment intentions at an aggregate level over the year ahead. This outlook appears to be supported by expectations of reasonably firm levels of output and profitability, although these are not as buoyant as they were a couple of years ago. Consistent with other indicators, the survey suggests a relatively weak investment outlook in manufacturing, with a strong outlook in mining, finance and <span class=\"no-wrap\">recreation (Graph 4)</span>. ", " This general picture for business investment is broadly in line with developments in profitability. Overall profitability of the corporate sector seems to be more than adequate, even if a little below the peak reached in 1993/94. The broadest measure of profits, <em>corporate gross operating surplus</em> (GOS) as a share of GDP, is only slightly below the most recent peak and close to the average of the past ten years (Graph 5). In the December quarter, GOS rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span>. Profits in the unincorporated sector are also estimated to have risen in the December quarter, after declining in the previous two quarters. <em>Profits after interest</em> have tended to decline over the past couple of years, reflecting the impact of the 1994 interest rate increases and a tendency for corporate leverage to increase, but they remain at high levels compared with historical averages; they can be expected to receive a further modest boost as interest-rate reductions in the second half of last year begin to feed through into profit results. ", " Business-sector balance sheets are currently in a healthy position. Debt servicing ratios of both the corporate and unincorporated sectors have been lower for the past couple of years than at any time in the preceding decade <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 6)</span>. The business sector now appears sufficiently confident to begin taking on more debt to finance growth in business investment. This is reflected in the business sector's demand for credit. After being sluggish for several years, credit to the business sector has picked up during the past couple of years and, while weaker than in 1995/96, is still growing at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span>. ", " There is considerable variation in profitability across industries, which appears to be an important contributor to differences in investment intentions. Profits have grown strongly over the past couple of years in the mining industry, driven by strong growth in sales volumes. In contrast, profits in the manufacturing sector have declined over the past two years and are now <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> below their peak in March 1995. Profits have also been sluggish in the wholesale and retailing industries, constrained by the weakness in retail sales during the second half <span class=\"no-wrap\">of 1996</span>. ", " A number of factors have contributed to the pressure on profits in manufacturing. Sales growth slackened as a result of weakness in retailing and in the housing industry which, for much of the past two years, was still experiencing declining activity. There also appears to have been a squeeze on margins in manufacturing, although the various data sources do not present a clear-cut picture in this area. Manufacturing output prices have been broadly flat for some time, constrained by strong international competition in many areas. Although imported input prices have been declining during the past year, as a result of the strengthening exchange rate, this appears to have been insufficient to offset the impact on profits of faster wage growth. Enterprise agreements in the manufacturing sector have been running at around <span class=\"no-wrap\"> 5 per cent</span>. With labour costs representing about <span class=\"no-wrap\">60    per cent</span> of value added in manufacturing, the net result has been a decline in overall profitability. ", " The outlook for manufacturers will depend on several factors, including their ability to contain costs and, for internationally oriented businesses, the level of the exchange rate. In the next year or two, another important influence will be the emerging housing recovery, since significant parts of manufacturing are engaged in the production of building materials or consumer goods stimulated by new housing development. Historical experience suggests that cycles in construction activity (defined as housing together with non-residential construction) exert a strong influence on the manufacturing sector (Graph 7). ", " Consistent with this link and with the firmer outlook for housing, some business surveys in manufacturing are showing signs of improved confidence. For example, the ACCI-Westpac Survey of the manufacturing industry conducted in the March quarter suggested somewhat stronger expectations of rises in profits and selling prices, although the assessment of current conditions was still weak. ", " Forward indicators of housing activity are continuing to point to an upswing in that sector. In terms of work done and commencements, housing activity has been at a trough for around the past year, but building approvals have clearly turned up (Graph 8). The level of private building approvals in the March quarter was <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> above the average level in 1995/96, with growth concentrated in building approvals for medium-density dwellings rather than houses. ", " Further increases in building approvals are suggested by data on lending for housing, which have also been trending upwards, although the monthly figures have been quite volatile (Graph 9). The value of loan approvals in January and February was <span class=\"no-wrap\">23 per cent</span> higher than a year ago. Although the upturn in lending for housing was initially confined to established and newly erected dwellings, this strength has spread more recently to finance for new construction by owner-occupier s, suggesting that commencements of private houses will soon increase. Finance for investor housing projects has also grown solidly in recent months and is now well above the trough reached in the middle of 1996. The gathering strength in finance and building approvals should flow through into stronger commencements in the course of this year. ", " The housing recovery is being supported by an historically high level of affordability of houses which, in turn, reflects the low level of nominal interest rates. Cuts in official interest rates in the second half of 1996 have been reinforced by a compression of intermediaries' interest margins on home mortgages, the result of intensified competitive pressures in this area of lending. Standard mortgage interest rates, at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.5 per cent</span>, are at their lowest level since the early 1970s, and indexes of housing affordability show affordability at close to record levels for the post-deregulation period. ", " Although the housing sector is picking up in aggregate, the picture is uneven geographically. Housing demand is strongest in NSW, not quite so strong in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, and flat in the other States and Territories. The unevenness is also apparent in house prices, which have been rising in Sydney and Melbourne – particularly in the inner suburbs – but are still flat or falling elsewhere. The apparent excess supply of housing stock in a number of areas, particularly outside the major capital cities, could act as a restraining influence on the overall pace of recovery. To date, the rate of growth in building approvals looks more like the moderately paced upturn in housing in the early 1990s, than the extremely rapid increases of the late 1980s cycle. ", " After being quite weak during the second half of 1996, consumer spending picked up in the early months of 1997 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 10)</span>. Retail sales rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.7 per cent</span> in January and, although this may have partly reflected a change in the timing of consumer spending around year end, the stronger January level was broadly maintained in February and March. In the March quarter, sales were <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.2 per cent</span> higher in real terms than in the December quarter. The pick-up was particularly marked in hospitality and services, household goods and other retailing; spending on clothing and recreational goods remained weak. Demand for motor vehicles has also strengthened markedly in the early months of 1997; in March, passenger vehicle registrations were <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> higher than their level in December. A good part of the additional demand seems to have been taken up by imports. ", " The weakness in consumer spending in 1996 partly reflected a slowing in growth of disposable income which, in turn, was related to slower employment growth during the year. There also appears to have been <span class=\"no-wrap\">some (welcome)</span> rebuilding of household saving during the year after a period when spending had been running ahead of income growth. In the December quarter, households are estimated to have saved nearly <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> of disposable income. While still low by historical and international standards, this is up from <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ per cent</span> a year earlier. Caution on the part of consumers may have been related to concerns about job security. Survey evidence suggests that consumers became more concerned about employment prospects during the course of the year; the net balance of respondents to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey expecting lower unemployment fell sharply over this time. Prospects for consumer spending will depend importantly on the extent of strengthening in the labour market over the coming year – both because of the impact on confidence and through the effect of employment growth on disposable income. ", " Notwithstanding the modest increase in saving rates recently, households' aggregate borrowing has continued to increase faster than income. Over the year to February, credit to the household sector grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span>, compared with growth in households' nominal income which has been running at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent;</span> much of the growth in debt has occurred in home mortgages. The value of household assets has also been growing solidly, particularly in superannuation funds and other investment products. The growth of gross household debt has seen the household sector's debt to income ratio on a gradually rising trend for much of the past decade. By international standards, however, the increases started from a low base and household debt ratios in Australia are currently not far from the average of other industrial countries (Table 2). ", " Longer-term growth in household borrowing has been encouraged by several factors. Financial deregulation has given many households greater access to credit, as well as expanding the range of financial services available. Combined with growth in household incomes, the attractiveness of many new financial products has encouraged the expansion of household balance sheets. The return to a low-inflation and low interest-rate environment may also have allowed households to take on more debt by making loans more affordable. ", " At this stage, the level of debt does not seem likely to be acting as a major constraint on household spending. Nonetheless, the higher debt levels suggest that households may have become more vulnerable to unforeseen falls in house prices or changes in household cash flow. In the past, if excessive debt levels were incurred by households, there was always the prospect that they could be eroded quite rapidly by inflation. A low-inflation environment, however, is much less forgiving of excessive debt. ", " Total employment has been growing at an average annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> for much of the past two years. There was a pick-up in the pace of employment growth in the September and December quarters of 1996 but this appears to have weakened in the March quarter (Graph 11). Employment growth in the recent period has been concentrated in part-time jobs; full-time employment has been, at best, flat in recent months, even allowing for the prospect of some reversal of the large monthly fall recorded in March, and there has been little net gain in full-time jobs since October 1995 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 12)</span>. Unemployment has edged up over the recent period, reaching a rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.7 per cent</span> in March, and labour force participation has come off the peaks recorded two years ago. ", " Interpretation of the monthly figures in recent months has been complicated by the effects of changes in interviewing procedures for the Labour Force Survey. The ABS reported in the December Survey that the introduction of telephone-based interviewing was leading to under-reporting of employment growth, suggesting that the pick-up in employment growth occurring around that time was greater than recorded in the official figures. It was later reported that, by February, this bias was no longer affecting the figures, leading to downward reassessments as to the underlying strength of employment. Shifting biases had apparently affected the pattern of monthly employment changes between July and February, but were no longer affecting the level. Given the uncertainties of interpretation, it seems unwise to put too much emphasis on changes in employment over short periods; viewed over the past year, employment has been sluggish, and does not appear to have accelerated further since the initial pick-up in the September quarter 1996. ", " The strength of demand for labour has varied quite considerably between industries. In the year to February, total employment fell in a number of industry categories mainly associated with the public sector. There were also employment falls in some cyclically sensitive areas of private-sector activity, including the building and retailing industries. These were offset by solid employment growth in other industries, including accommodation, finance and property. ", " With employment growth normally lagging behind developments in the economy as a whole, the relatively modest average employment growth appear s broadly consistent with the pace in GDP growth (Graph 13). A pick-up in employment growth in the course of the current year would seem consistent with the range of indicators pointing to faster growth in overall activity. Forward indicators in the labour market also point to some firming in labour demand. Private-sector job vacancies are at a high level and appear to be on a modest upward trend <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 14)</span>. A strong increase in the December quarter was only partly reversed in the March quarter, and vacancies remain at a level which in the past has been consistent with solid employment growth. A cyclical strengthening in the demand for labour will help to reduce unemployment. On its own, however, faster economic growth will not do enough to reduce unemployment significantly, unless it is accompanied by moderation in growth of labour costs. ", " <em>Productivity</em> has continued to grow at a relatively fast rate in the course of the current recovery. Growth in non-farm GDP per hour worked – a broad measure of labour productivity – has averaged <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.8 per cent</span> per annum since the start of the recovery, a higher rate than in the corresponding phase of the previous cycle, but slightly lower than in the 1970s cycle. However, <em>total factor productivity</em>, which allows for changes in both labour and capital inputs into the production process, and is therefore a better measure of efficiency, is growing faster in the current recovery than in the corresponding phases of either of the two previous cycles (<a href=\"#box-2\">Box 2)</a>. ", " Both exports and imports picked up strongly in value terms in the first two months of 1997 before falling substantially in March (Graph 15). In volume terms, export growth may have picked up a little from the slow pace in 1996, but it remains below its longer-term average. The slowing of export growth during 1996 was broadly based with the exception of rural exports, which continued to benefit from the breaking of the drought. A major factor behind the slowing seems to have been the weakening of growth in the east Asian economies, the effect of which has showed up most clearly in resource and manufactured exports to those countries. In contrast, exports to non-Asian trading partners, including the US, South Africa and a number of middle eastern countries, were growing quite strongly. The more recent pick-up in export growth reflects continuing strength of rural exports and stronger exports of resources. Exports of manufactured goods weakened in 1996 after a run of strong years; in the March quarter of 1997 they were below their level a year earlier. ", " Interpretation of data on imports is complicated by differences in the seasonal adjustments calculated on a monthly and quarterly basis. While the seasonally adjusted monthly import data point to reasonable growth in the March quarter, the corresponding data for the quantity of imports on a quarterly basis appear little changed. Nevertheless, in a trend sense, the data suggest that import quantities have grown quite strongly since mid 1996, at a quarterly pace of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span>. Growth has occurred across categories but has been strongest in intermediate and capital goods; consumption good imports have been more sluggish, reflecting softer consumer demand in the second half of last year (Graph 16). ", " Modest growth in export quantities and prices, together with flat imports (on a quarterly basis), pushed the March quarter balance on goods and services back into a surplus of around half of one per cent of GDP, reversing the deterioration late last year. The net services balance contributed around two-thirds of this total and has now been in surplus for almost two years. The data point to a positive contribution to growth in GDP from net exports in the March quarter. ", " Fiscal consolidation continued in 1996. The underlying Commonwealth Budget deficit has fallen from a peak of over <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> of GDP in 1992/93 to an estimated <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.7 per cent</span> of GDP in 1996/97 (estimated as at the Mid-Year Review published in January) (Table 3). The fall in the total public sector borrowing requirement over the same period has been somewhat larger, reflecting significant consolidation by State governments, partly offset by smaller surpluses of public trading enterprises. Further substantial reductions in the Commonwealth Budget deficit are in prospect in the years ahead. ", " Growth in financial intermediation is continuing at a steady pace. There are some signs that credit growth has picked up in recent months, after a weaker period in the second half of 1996, although it remains slower than that recorded in 1995/96 (Table 4). In recent months, total credit has been growing at annual rates around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span>, with personal credit growth slightly stronger than the total. ", " Financial intermediaries have been funding this expansion in credit through both domestic and offshore raisings, and have issued short-term and longer-term debt securities to supplement deposits. Broad money, which comprises currency and deposits, has been growing at annual rates around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> for the past year. Currency growth, by contrast, has been considerably lower and has exhibited little cyclicality since the early 1990s, in marked contrast to earlier cycles. If anything, currency growth appears to be on a steady downward trend, perhaps reflecting technical innovation in the payments system. For most of the past year, currency has been growing at year-ended rates around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span>. ", " In <em>underlying</em> terms, consumer prices rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.4 per cent</span> in the March quarter 1997, and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span> over the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 17)</span>. Both the quarterly and annual rates were unchanged from the previous quarter, and the annual rate is now well below the recent peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span> reached in the March quarter 1996. ", " The <em>headline</em> Consumer Price Index rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span> in the quarter, bringing the year-ended rate to <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.3 per cent</span>, down from <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.5 per cent</span> in the December quarter and well down from its recent peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.1 per cent</span> in the December quarter 1995. Falls in mortgage interest rates detracted 0.5 of a percentage point from the quarterly headline rate and, on a year-ended basis, interest rate reductions that have already occurred will keep the headline inflation rate below the underlying rate for some time. ", " Other measures of inflation confirm the reduction that has taken place over the past year. Producer prices have been very subdued, with final output prices in manufacturing rising by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the year to February. Similarly, construction materials prices have been little changed over the past year. The fixed-weight deflator for private consumption rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.5 per cent</span> over the year to the December quarter, while the broader fixed-weight deflators also showed increases of less than <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. All of these indicator s show inflation running at substantially lower rates than a year ago. ", " A higher trade-weighted value of the Australian dollar over the past year has contributed importantly to the lower inflation outcomes. At the retail level, prices of imported consumer goods fell in the year to the March quarter by just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent;</span> domestically produced goods prices are also rising more slowly than a year ago, but the slowing is less pronounced and, in the year to March, domestic goods prices rose by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">3  per cent</span>. Prices of imported goods at the wholesale level, which typically move more closely in line with the exchange rate, have fallen much more rapidly than those of imported retail goods. Over 1996, total import prices fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span> (Graph 18). The exchange rate has appreciated a little further in trade-weighted terms in recent months, principally reflecting a decline in the Japanese yen, raising the prospect of further falls in import prices in the near term. ", " Wage rates, as measured by average weekly ordinary-time earnings of adults working full time (AWOTE), increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.3 per cent</span> in the three months to February and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.6 per cent</span> over the year (Graph 19). The annual figure represents a clear acceleration from a figure of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.9 per cent</span> over the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">November 1996</span>, and follows a period when this measure of aggregate wages growth had been fairly steady at around 4 per cent. ", " The overall increase in AWOTE masks divergent behaviour between the estimated public and private-sector components during the past year, which complicates the interpretation of recent trends. A breakdown between the two components, available up to November, shows public-sector earnings growing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.6 per cent</span> over the year. This is considerably faster than increases in public-sector enterprise agreements, and may be distorted by compositional change or other problems in the survey. To the extent that this is the case, it could be contributing to an overstatement of aggregate wages growth. According to the same survey, private-sector AWOTE decelerated considerably from an annual rate of over 6 per cent in mid 1995 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.8 per  cent</span> over the year to November 1996, although this seems likely to be an overstatement of the decline. ", " These considerations suggest, on balance, that the total AWOTE increase on a year-ended basis may have been slightly overstating wages growth on the last few readings. Nonetheless, the February data point to a significant acceleration in wages and, even allowing for some degree of overstatement, this would be a disturbing trend if it were sustained. ", " Wage increases in enterprise bargaining agreements have been running at quite a high rate, although they may have eased slightly towards the end of 1996 (Graph 20). Annualised increases in new agreements in the December quarter were <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.4 per cent</span>, down from 4.8 per cent in the September quarter. In the private sector, the slowing was more pronounced, from <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.3 per cent</span> in the September quarter to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.4 per cent</span> in the December quarter. These figures are influenced by the industry composition of agreements being negotiated, and the December quarter figures reflect some major agreements in industries that usually grant lower increases. Some important agreements in the manufacturing, finance, transport and construction industries are to be completed in coming months and these will need to be watched closely. ", " Growth of executive salaries continues to outpace both overall wage growth and enterprise agreements. According to the Cullen Egan Dell survey, executive salaries rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.9 per cent</span> over the year to March, broadly the same as the rate of increase over the previous year. ", " Award wages, in contrast, have for a number of years been growing more slowly than wages in other bargaining streams, at annual rates of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span>. The Safety-Net Review completed in April by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission considered a claim by the ACTU for a $20 a week safety-net adjustment and an increase in award wages of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.75 per cent;</span> this was part of a larger three-stage claim seeking eventual award increases of around 30 per cent. The review thus had the potential to add substantially to aggregate labour costs if anything approaching the ACTU claim were granted. In the event, the Commission awarded a much more moderate increase in award wages of $10 a week and established a new federal minimum wage of <span class=\"no-wrap\">$359.40 a week</span> for full-time adult employees. The Commission has deferred consideration of stages <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 and 3 of the claim</span>. ", " The $10 a week increase is equivalent to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1¾  per cent</span> for workers on average award wages, and thus entails little acceleration from the current rate of growth in awards of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span>. Around a quarter of workers will be affected, assuming the same increase flows into State awards; given that the pick-up in awards growth is quite modest, flow-ons for other workers on grounds of relativities are likely to be small. The addition to aggregate wages growth will also be small. ", " Expectations of inflation have generally come down over the past year, broadly in line with falls in inflation itself. Surveys of consumers and financial market participants have shown the most pronounced falls. Among producers, surveys suggest that expectations of selling-price increases moved up a little in the most recent quarters, perhaps in anticipation of firmer demand conditions, but they remain well down from a year ago. ", " Consumer inflation expectations, as measured by the Melbourne Institute Survey in April, have shifted down significantly in the past six months (Graph 21). The median expectation of consumer price inflation over the year ahead now stands at <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span>, compared with levels of well over <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> in the previous couple of years. Although expectations remain higher than actual rates of inflation, this measure of consumer inflation expectations is now around its lowest level since the survey began in 1973. ", " According to the latest NAB Survey, retailers expect to raise their average selling prices by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span> in the June quarter. This represents an increase from the responses given in the previous two quarters, but is still lower than most of the readings from this survey over the past five years. Other surveys of producers also suggest a modest increase in price expectations, again coming from very subdued levels. The net balance of respondents to the ACM and ACCI-Westpac surveys expecting to increase selling prices has risen, but remains low relative to results of the past few years. ", " Near-term inflation expectations of financial market participants have continued to fall. A survey of financial market economists, conducted by the Bank in April, shows the median forecast of <em>underlying</em> inflation falling to <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.8 per cent</span> for the year to June 1997 (Graph 22). These forecasts have been consistently revised downwards in successive surveys over a period of more than a year. <em>Headline</em> inflation forecasts for the current year were revised down even more dramatically, mainly reflecting the impact of falls in mortgage interest rates. The median forecast for headline inflation in the year to June 1997 now stands at <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.8 per cent</span>. For the following year, underlying inflation of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.6 per cent</span> is expected, with a similar figure for the headline rate as mortgage interest reductions drop out of the calculation. ", " Longer-run inflation expectations are lower than they were a year ago, but seem to have stabilised more recently, and they remain higher than the mid-point of the Bank's target. Expectations implied by indexed bond yields, i.e. calculated from the difference between yields on indexed and conventional 10-year bonds, are currently around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span>. This measure has fluctuated around the <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> mark for much of the past year, but is well below the levels of the previous two years. Medium-term expectations recorded in the NAB Survey show some substantial declines in expected inflation have occurred during the past year, but more than half the respondents still expect inflation to be in the 3 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> range. ", " A number of factors are likely to contribute to maintaining the good recent performance on inflation in the near future, with wages developments representing the main risk to a favourable outlook further ahead. As noted, the effects of the higher trade-weighted exchange rate will continue to feed through into lower import prices for some time, and will therefore help to restrain aggregate inflation. The strength of import competition should also act as a restraining influence on prices of many domestically produced goods. Inflation expectations have dropped back during the past year, and the falls in headline inflation that are in prospect could help to reinforce those lower expectations. Although the pace of growth in activity is picking up, there is scope at present for the economy to grow faster without meeting serious capacity constraints. Against this background, the Bank expects underlying inflation during 1997 to remain low, probably declining slightly below 2 per cent for a while. Some pick-up in inflation is likely in 1998 as the favourable exchange rate effects pass but, provided growth in labour costs is not excessive, price inflation should remain within the 2 to 3 per cent range. ", " Headline inflation will fall further below the underlying rate in the next few quarters as recent interest rate reductions are reflected in the index. The headline rate could drop below half of one per cent by the second half of 1997, before moving back towards the underlying figure as the interest rate reductions pass out of the calculation. ", " The relatively modest outcome in the ‘living wage’ case removes one source of danger to this outlook. The increases granted will raise the rate of wages growth for workers on award wages, but the acceleration is quite mild and it will have only a small impact on aggregate wage costs. ", " Broader wage developments do, however, present some risk to the inflation outlook. The February AWOTE increase suggests a pick-up in aggregate wages growth which, even allowing for a degree of overstatement, brings annual wages growth to a rate of over <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. Enterprise bargaining agreements have been delivering annual increases of between 4 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> and, in some agreements currently being negotiated, higher figures have been mooted. Risks to the inflation outlook would arise if these increases were to accelerate as the economy strengthens, or if they spread more widely to other bargaining streams, pushing aggregate wages growth to levels inconsistent with maintaining low inflation. ", " High rates of overall wages growth, if continued, will also make for slow progress in reducing unemployment. It is quite possible for nominal wages to grow at a pace which is consistent with meeting the inflation objective, but still fast enough to close off opportunities for strong employment growth. There is a danger of this occurring in Australia, if those in jobs try to extract the gains from growth, to the detriment of those presently without jobs. In a flexible labour market, unemployment as high as it presently is would result in slowing wages growth. This appeared to be happening, to some extent, in Australia over the past year or so, but overall wages growth has remained high in comparison with inflation and may again be accelerating. Wages growth also seems high in international terms (<a href=\"#box-3\">Box 3</a>). This phenomenon lessens the scope which might otherwise exist for macroeconomic policies to expand the economy more quickly to a point where it operates with significantly lower unemployment. ", " The international environment is broadly supportive of continued growth in the Australian economy. For the advanced economies in aggregate, growth in 1996 has remained at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span>, but the IMF is forecasting a modest firming in 1997 and 1998, to just under 3 per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 5)</span>. In the past, these sorts of growth rates abroad have provided reasonable growth opportunities for Australian exports. ", " These aggregate figures mask some significant differences across the major economies. In the United States – which, historically, has tended to have a disproportionate impact on Australian business conditions – growth has been accelerating quite markedly, and concerns about potential inflationary pressures prompted a rise in official interest rates in March. In Japan, growth picked up substantially in 1996, although it remains to be seen whether this stronger momentum will be carried forward during 1997. The major European economies, with the exception of the UK, have been relatively weak. Recently, however, there have been signs that growth is starting to <span class=\"no-wrap\">pick up</span>. In most of the east Asian region outside Japan, industrial production and international trade are starting to recover after having slowed sharply in 1995 and early 1996. The overall outlook expected by the IMF is for firmer growth in the world economy, but for the distribution of growth to change across countries, with the United States economy slowing back towards trend but greater strength in some of the other major economies. Significant growth is expected in the ‘transition’ economies for the first time since 1989. ", " In the March quarter of 1997, real GDP grew by 1.4 per cent, following the strong rise in the December quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 23)</span>. For much of the past year, the economy has been growing faster than trend capacity growth, and unemployment has been edging downwards. In April, the unemployment rate was <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.9 per cent</span>, which is below levels that in the past have been associated with rising wage pressures. Monthly employment figures up to April, and other indicators such as industrial production, confirm the solid pace of growth in the early months of this year. The presumption of most observers is that, if the economy does not slow, inflationary pressures will become more intense. ", " To date, these pressures have not flowed through into general price inflation. The CPI, excluding food and energy, rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.5 per cent</span> in the year to March, a slight deceleration from previous months. Earnings growth, however, has picked up noticeably, reflecting the tight labour market conditions. Average hourly earnings rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.6 per cent</span> in the year to April, compared with <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> a year earlier. A broader measure of labour costs, the Employment Cost Index, has also picked up, but more slowly, reflecting moderation in non-wage labour costs. ", " The combination of ongoing strength in activity and signs of inflationary pressure in the labour market prompted a tightening of monetary policy, by 25 basis points, in late March. This was the first move since the completion of a series of easings that had taken place between July 1995 and January 1996. ", " The Japanese economy grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.7 per cent</span> in 1996, its second year of firmer growth after an extended period of weakness (Graph 24). The quarterly pattern of GDP growth in 1996 is difficult to interpret, but suggests some bounce-back after a relatively flat period in the middle of the year. Unemployment has dipped slightly during the past six months and is currently 3.2 per cent, down from a peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ per cent</span> in the middle of 1996, but still high by historical standards. There is still substantial surplus capacity in the economy and no evidence of inflationary pressures. In the year to March, the CPI rose by just <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span>, and this was affected by rising import prices as a result of a decline in the yen. Subsequent inflation data will reflect the rise in the VAT rate in April. ", " The tax increases and government spending cuts currently being implemented are expected to have some dampening effect on demand over the year ahead, although they may have brought forward some spending in the early months of 1997. On the other hand, domestic demand should continue to be supported by the low level of interest rates, while the recent depreciation of the yen is giving a significant boost to export growth. ", " Growth in other east Asian economies slowed during 1995 and 1996. Growth in industrial production in the region slowed to a rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> in late 1996, down from a peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">14 per cent</span> in 1994. The slowing of trade growth for countries in the region was dramatic, reflecting a combination of structural and cyclical factors. Among the latter were a contraction in international demand for electronics and a loss of competitiveness as currencies appreciated with the US dollar against the yen. There appears to have been some pick-up in activity in the past few months, particularly in China and Taiwan. Activity is also stronger in Hong Kong and remains robust in Indonesia and Malaysia. ", " By contrast, in South Korea – Australia's second biggest Asian market – exports and industrial production have been disrupted by labour unrest, and corporate bankruptcies and political uncertainty have affected business confidence. Thailand is coping with a period of financial stress associated with falling asset prices and declining loan quality in the banking system. These conditions may hamper economic performance in the period immediately ahead. ", " The major economies of continental Europe have been recovering from recession since 1994, but the pace of recovery has been only moderate and, during 1996, proved insufficient to prevent unemployment rising from already high levels. The weak growth performance, in turn, has made it difficult for countries to meet the fiscal goals stipulated by the Maastricht treaty. Interest rates are at low levels, however, and should be supportive of recovery. ", " In the two largest economies – France and Germany – the most recent figures point to some lift in the pace of growth in recent months, but growth rates are still quite modest (Graph 25). Unemployment in both countries is at historically high levels – over <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span> in Germany and over <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> in France. Fiscal contractions required to meet the Maastricht goals could be a further dampening influence in the year ahead. Some positive impetus, however, is coming from the export sector, which is being boosted by depreciation of the European currencies against the US dollar. The Italian economy has been even weaker than France and Germany, showing little overall growth in the year to the December quarter. ", " In contrast, the UK and some smaller European economies have performed more strongly. The UK has had quite robust growth for several years and unemployment has fallen steadily, reaching a rate of 6.1 per cent early <span class=\"no-wrap\">in 1997</span>. There is evidence that inflationary pressures are developing and the Bank of England has been recommending a second interest-rate increase (following the first in October 1996) for several months. ", " Most commodity prices have tended to firm in recent months. The Bank's Commodity Price Index (in SDRs) rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> during the March quarter, to a level <span class=\"no-wrap\">21 per cent</span> higher than the trough reached in <span class=\"no-wrap\">September 1993</span> (Graph 26); it then eased back a little in April. Base metal prices have followed a similar pattern this year, rising by 15 per cent in the first three months of the year, supported by strengthening world industrial production. Some of these gains were reversed in April after the monetary policy tightening in the United States prompted some downward revisions to expected demand for commodities. Rural prices also rose strongly, showing an increase of <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> during the quarter. The increase reflected higher prices for wool as well as firmer beef prices which were boosted by a temporary shortage in the United States. ", " In contrast to the strength of rural and base metals prices, other non-rural commodity prices have tended to fall in early 1997. The price of oil has fallen from around US$25 a barrel at the start of the year to around US$20 a barrel in April; this brings it roughly back to its level in the first half of 1996. The price of gold has also steadily declined during 1997, falling by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> between December and April. New contract prices for coal, which came into effect in April, were lower, but there was a small increase in iron ore prices. ", " The stability that has characterised the Australian economy over the past year has resulted in a number of favourable developments in financial markets, the most noticeable of which is that interest rates have fallen to low levels – in the case of housing interest rates, to levels not seen for a quarter of a century. This has brought substantial benefits to borrowers – households, business and governments – and is underpinning an increased demand for credit. Equity prices have also shown a solid increase – <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span> over the past couple of years – which has increased access to, and reduced the cost of, equity capital. ", " The exchange rate of the Australian dollar has moved to a flatter trend after the increase over late <span class=\"no-wrap\">1995/early    1996</span>. Our exchange rate against the US dollar and the currencies of most of our trading partners has shown little net change over the past year, and the rise in the trade-weighted index in recent months has been due mainly to the weakness being experienced by the Japanese yen. By and large, this is a reflection of the very accommodative monetary stance being followed by the Japanese authorities and, given the different cyclical positions of Australia and Japan, some rise in the exchange rate between the countries is to be expected. ", " Australia has not been alone in being affected by these developments in Japan. With the Japanese economy and interest rates well out of synchronisation with most other countries, there have been significant realignments in exchange rates in international markets. At the same time, the outflows of funds from Japan have helped to support bond and equity markets in a range of other countries, including Australia. ", " Interest rates have fallen across the maturity spectrum over the past year. At the short end, rates are down from <span class=\"no-wrap\">7½ per cent</span> in mid 1996 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> at present. This reflected the three easings in monetary policy over the second half of 1996 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 27)</span>. The Bank began this easing process in July 1996 in anticipation of a fall in inflation over the second half of the year. This was ahead of general expectations at the time and, as a consequence, was greeted with some surprise in markets, a symptom of which was a temporary fall in the exchange rate. The Bank followed through with two further easings, in November and December, as inflation improved. ", " At its current level, the cash rate is roughly half way between the recent peak in 1995, when policy was exerting a restraining influence on demand, and the low point in 1993, when the policy setting was highly stimulatory. The same observation is broadly true for measures of the ‘real’ cash rate – that is, the nominal rate adjusted for measures of expected inflation (<a href=\"#box-4\">Box 4</a>). After allowing for the compression of interest margins by financial intermediaries, however, the real rates of interest paid by borrowers are at levels similar to or, with the case of housing loans, below those in 1993 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 28)</span>. ", " The monetary policy easings in the second half of 1996 have been fully passed on by banks to both businesses and home loan borrowers. The small business indicator rate has been reduced to 9.8 per cent, from <span class=\"no-wrap\">11.3 per cent</span>, while the large business indicator rate has fallen to 9.3 per cent from 10.8 per cent. The fall in home lending rates has been considerably larger than the reduction in cash rates, reflecting the intensified competition in the provision of housing finance (<a href=\"#box-5\">Box 5</a>). The predominant standard variable rate on housing loans has fallen by about 3 percentage points since early 1996, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.5 per    cent</span>. ", " While banks fully passed on the easings, there was a noticeable tendency to impose significantly longer lags in implementing these reductions than was the case when interest rates were increased in 1994. Existing home loan borrowers had to wait 6–7 weeks on average, small business borrowers 5–6 weeks and large business borrowers around 3–4 weeks. By contrast, when monetary policy was tightened in 1994, business and housing loans were generally raised around 2 weeks after the policy announcements. ", " Short-term security yields in the money market moved down generally in line with the cash rate as policy was eased. Thereafter, they continued to fall in late December and January as markets moved to price in a further easing, reaching a low of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.7 per cent</span>. By February, however, the weight of evidence pointing to a pick-up in economic activity caused the market to abandon these expectations. Since then, short-term security yields have traded in a narrow margin around the cash rate, indicating that markets are not expecting policy changes in the near term. ", " At the long end of the yield curve, sentiment began to improve noticeably a year ago, reflecting the decline in the Budget deficit and the improvement in inflation. The benefit for the bond market in the fiscal improvement is clearly illustrated by the fact that, in the current fiscal year, the Government's net call on the bond market for new funds has been only about $4 billion, compared with $14 billion two years earlier. This reduced call by the Government has opened up the market to private sector borrowers; issues of corporate bonds over the past year were the highest since 1991. ", " Capital markets are very sensitive to inflation because of its impact on real long-term returns, so it is not surprising that bond yields have fallen as inflation has come down. A year ago, yields on 10-year bonds in Australia were around <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent;</span> by late 1996 they had fallen to close to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> (Graph 29). The fall was to some extent reinforced by a fairly benign environment in international bond markets, but nonetheless Australian bonds outperformed key benchmarks such as the US bond market. The spread between Australian 10-year bond yields and comparable US yields narrowed from 250 basis points a year ago to about 100 basis points at <span class=\"no-wrap\">present (Graph 30)</span>. This is close to historical lows. ", " One of the features of bond markets over recent years is that spreads – or risk premia – of all types have come down. This is the case for spreads between countries, and between bonds of different credit quality within the same country. For example, leaving aside Japan, among the industrial countries the gap between the country with the highest bond yields and that with the lowest bond yields has fallen to less than 2 percentage points <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 31)</span>. To a large extent, this reflects a marked convergence of inflation rates, to low levels, among these countries. Other factors, however, have also played a role. Some of these are favourable, such as the global push for fiscal consolidation and the increasing international integration of capital markets. Others, such as the tendency for investors to become increasingly eager to chase high yields as the general level of interest rates falls, suggest a need for caution. After a prolonged period of relatively tranquil conditions in markets, participants often see little danger in taking on more risk. ", " An important issue in bond markets at present is whether the recent tightening of 25 points by the US Federal Reserve marks the start of a more general uptrend in interest rates. In the past, there have been some similarities between the US interest rate cycle and that of other countries, particularly the English-speaking countries. This reflects correlations in economic cycles. The United Kingdom tightened policy in late 1996, and markets have begun to price in tightenings in a wider range of countries, most evidently in Canada, where interest rates are currently below those in the US and where the exchange rate has been weakening. ", " The possibility that there may be a global upswing in interest rates in the year ahead has seen bond yields in most countries rise over the past couple of months. In Australia, bond yields have increased to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.7 per cent</span>, a move broadly in keeping with global trends. In this respect, the Australian bond market has performed better than in 1994, the previous occasion when the US Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates. On that occasion Australian bond yields rose significantly more than those in the US, reflecting market concerns that Australia would not be able to maintain control over inflation in an environment of strong global expansion. The spread between US and Australian bonds, which had been under 100 basis points in early 1994 before the tightening, reached over 300 points by early 1995. In the current episode, the spread has remained in a fairly tight range around <span class=\"no-wrap\">100 points</span>, helped no doubt by the continuing good news on inflation and the favourable outcome of the recent wage judgment. This more benign market reaction may be a sign that Australia is improving its standing in world markets as a low inflation country. This will have important benefits for government, business and household borrowers. ", " The impact of the fall in interest rates over the past year has also been felt in the share market. It has made shares more attractive both on a relative yield basis and because it has improved the outlook for corporate profitability, particularly after interest payments. ", " In addition, the Australian market has benefited from the strong lead provided by the US share market, where prices have risen by almost 90 per cent since the start of 1995. Besides low interest rates, the factor s underpinning this strength in the US market have been the high profits of US corporations, reflecting the strength and soundness of the US economy, and the strong inflows into equity mutual funds from US households. ", " By late 1996, the rapid pace of increase in US equity prices seemed to be an emerging source of concern to the US Federal Reserve, as it had the potential to cause imbalances which could ultimately undermine the continued expansion of the US economy. These concerns, which were publicly stated by Chairman Greenspan on a number of occasions, caused the market to pause. Subsequently, following the tightening of US monetary policy, the market fell sharply for a time, but had more than recovered by early May <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 32)</span>. ", " These recent US developments largely flowed through to the Australian share market, the result being that it has shown a small net rise so far in 1997. The current level of share prices nonetheless remains <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span> higher than two years earlier. While this is no match for the increase in the US share market over this period, it is a solid rate of increase in a low inflation environment. ", " Businesses continue to take advantage of favourable equity market conditions to raise new funds. These raisings amounted to $15 billion in 1996, up from $14 billion the previous year and roughly double the levels experienced during the period of share market weakness in the early 1990s. ", " A year ago, the forces acting on the Australian dollar exchange rate were all working in the direction of pushing it up. Notably, the outlook for the US economy, and therefore commodity prices, was improving, providing a favourable environment for commodity exports. Also, interest differentials substantially favoured Australian investments. This was particularly the case for Japanese investors, who faced extremely low interest rates at home. Very large inflows of funds from Japan came from late 1995, assisted by innovations such as bonds featuring repayments in a combination of both Australian dollars and Japanese yen, which thereby reduced some of the exchange rate risk for Japanese investors. Retail investors in Japan had a strong appetite for these securities. ", " It is not surprising, therefore, that after its sharp dip to <span class=\"no-wrap\">US71 cents</span> (TWI of 48.5) in mid 1995, the Australian dollar recovered strongly to reach US79 cents (TWI of 58) by early 1996. Since then, the exchange rate against the US dollar has shown little net change, if anything weakening a little (Graph 33). More generally, the exchange rate has been steady, or has fallen, against the currencies of countries accounting for two-thirds of Australia's trade. ", " Despite the steady performance of the Australian dollar against the bulk of Australia's trading partners, its <span class=\"no-wrap\">trade-weighted</span> value has risen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">4–5 per cent</span> over the past year. The bulk of this has been due to the exchange rate against the Japanese yen, as the yen has fallen sharply on world markets, including a fall of about 50 per cent against the US dollar from its peaks in mid 1995. ", " Investment flows out of Japan have been an important factor shaping world financial markets over the past couple of years, not only because of overseas investment by Japanese residents, but also because non-residents have taken advantage of cheap Japanese money to fund positions in other markets. A tightening in monetary policy by Japan would be an important signal that this period was coming to an end, and would therefore be likely to have a significant impact on market psychology. ", " Overall, factors affecting the foreign exchange market are more mixed than they were a year ago. Most notably, the extent to which interest differentials favour Australian investments has narrowed significantly following the easings of Australian monetary policy in the second half of 1996. The most visible impact of this has been in the drying up of inflows from Japan into dual-currency bonds in 1997, following the easings. The recent tightening of US monetary policy has further contributed to the narrowing of differentials. ", " Like virtually all industrialised countries, Australia has experienced three recessions and three expansions in the past quarter of a century. This box sets out the facts on the length of the economic expansions following the recessions of the mid 1970s, early 1980s and early 1990s. ", " Recessions and expansions cannot be dated by simply looking at figures for GDP. Any single variable is likely to contain too many random movements for it to be used as the sole arbiter of the timing of business cycles (some anomalous instances are illustrated below). Instead, a range of national accounts aggregates, labour market measures and indicator s from the manufacturing sector are used to develop a more general picture of cyclical developments. ", " These cyclical indicators are summarised in Graphs 1, 2 and 3. In each case, the shaded areas show the recession, broadly defined as a period in which there is some fall in the level of the indicator of economic activity (or rise in the case of the unemployment rate). The exact position of the shaded area varies slightly according to which cyclical indicator is used, but the similarity of the pattern far outweighs the differences. ", " Graph 1 shows four measures of economic activity derived from the national accounts. Interestingly, it is these that give the least satisfactory dating of the business cycle. Although they point to the usual pattern of three recessions and three expansions, there are two anomalies. ", " The first is that GDP and non-farm GDP both show only a short and modest fall in economic activity in the 1974 recession, unlike those shown by other national accounts measures and data on the labour market and the manufacturing sector. ", " The second anomaly is that all four national accounts indicators show a ‘mini recession’ during calendar 1977 which is less apparent in the labour market and manufacturing indicators. Other OECD economies continued to grow through this period although there was a levelling out in industrial production. This period might be better regarded as representing a pause in the late 1970s recovery, rather than the starting point of another cycle;<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> the 1980s expansion was also characterised by a mid-cycle slowing. ", " Graph 2 shows that labour market measures clearly identify three recessions. Each is quite pronounced, and the only unusual aspect is that the 1970s recession shows up as being quite prolonged when measured by the rise in the unemployment rate, which rose almost continuously from June 1974 to March 1978. The large rise in real wages at this time explains why the unemployment rate indicates a deeper and longer recession than the other indicators of the cycle. ", " Graph 3 shows three measures from the manufacturing sector. Two measures of manufacturing output have been used because neither completely covers the estimation period.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> Again, each recession and expansion is very pronounced. This is not surprising, given that the manufacturing sector usually shows much greater cyclical movements than the economy as a whole. ", " Having dated the recessions, the expansions can then be identified as the period between each recession. Table 1 shows the length and strength of each expansion, based on eight of the ten indicators. (Two cyclical indicators – unemployment and ACCI/Westpac Survey – have not been used because it is not possible to calculate growth rates from them.) ", " On the basis of the above measures, both of the previous expansions lasted 6–7 years. Some data on the current expansion to date are included for indicative purposes, but its length cannot be determined until it finishes. ", " The average growth rate of each variable for each expansion is shown in parentheses. On the basis of each of the eight variables, the 1980s expansion has been the strongest, the current expansion is the next strongest and the 1970s expansion is the weakest. Part of the strength of the 1980s is due to faster population growth at that time. The differences in growth rates for non-farm GDP per head across the three expansions are smaller than for most of the other variables. ", " The rate of productivity growth in the economy is the rate of growth of output that can be produced from a given amount of input of labour, capital, etc. Labour productivity growth – the rate of growth of <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>output per hour worked</em> –</span> is also a useful concept since labour productivity growth ultimately determines the sustainable rate of growth of real wages in the economy. ", " Labour productivity growth tends to follow the business cycle, rising as activity strengthens and falling as it weakens. This is because, as a rule, firms in the economy take some time to adjust their level of employment in response to a change in demand for their output. When comparing labour productivity performance between economic cycles, it is therefore important to measure labour productivity over common phases of the cycle. ", " For the past three business cycles, an appropriate comparison is between average labour productivity growth for the 5½ years after each trough in output (the current expansion has run for 5½ years since the trough in output in June 1991). On this basis, labour productivity growth in the current expansion has been significantly stronger than in the 1980s expansion, but somewhat weaker than in the 1970s <span class=\"no-wrap\">expansion (Graph 1)</span>. ", " Part of the differences in labour productivity growth between business cycles reflects differences in the rate of capital accumulation and employment growth. Labour productivity can be boosted by a rise in capital input relative to labour input. Such a boost to labour productivity can occur even if labour and capital resources are used no more efficiently than before. It is possible, using quite simple techniques, to estimate how much of the difference in labour productivity growth between business cycles is due to changes in the capital intensity of the economy and how much is due to improved efficiency – so-called <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>total factor productivity</em></span>. ", " The 1970s business cycle was characterised by a combination of strong growth in the capital stock, but very weak growth in hours worked; this outcome occurred largely because real wages were rising faster than labour productivity (Table 1). The 1980s cycle was also characterised by strong growth in the capital stock; growth in hours worked was also strong, however, because of moderation in real wages in that cycle. In the 1990s cycle, the capital stock is estimated to have grown more slowly than in previous cycles; hours worked, by contrast, have grown faster than in the 1970s cycle but slower than in the 1980s one, again consistent with the behaviour of real wages. ", " The changing capital intensity of the economy explains some of the differences in labour productivity growth between business cycles. Labour productivity growth was boosted in the 1970s cycle by rising capital intensity, but held back somewhat in the 1980s cycle as growth in hours worked outstripped growth in the capital stock. Allowing for these changes in capital and labour inputs, total factor productivity grew at rates of 1.4 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.2  per cent</span> in the first two expansions; in the 1990s expansion it is estimated to have grown at the stronger rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span>. ", " It appears that the extensive changes in the economy over the past decade – including a structural fall in the inflation rate, productivity-enhancing changes in the labour market, corporatisation and privatisation of public-sector enterprises and substantial falls in the barriers to international trade – have led to an improvement in Australia's underlying rate of productivity growth. This higher rate of underlying productivity growth, if sustained, should enable the economy to grow at a higher average rate than was possible in the past. Raising the growth rate of the economy by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> (the difference between the underlying productivity growth rate in the 1990s cycle and the average of the earlier cycles) makes little difference over a year or two; over a decade or two, however, the cumulated effect on living standards is substantial. ", " Low inflation is currently the norm for most countries. A comparison of the experience of the major industrialised (G7) countries, Australia and New Zealand, shows that seven of these nine countries have experienced average inflation in the range <span class=\"no-wrap\">1–3 per cent</span> over the past two years (Table 1). Australia's average inflation rate over this time, at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.7 per cent</span>, is typical of that of many other countries. ", " Consistent with this low inflation, rates of wage growth have also been low for most countries in the OECD. Four of the nine countries shown in the table experienced average wage growth of less than <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> over the past two years; three had wage growth in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">3–4      per cent</span> range. Australia and Italy were the outliers, with average wage growth of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.4 per cent</span>. ", " Faster average wage growth in Australia has been accompanied by trend growth in labour productivity which is faster than the average of the countries shown in the table. From the point of view of controlling inflation in Australia, this combination of wages growth and productivity growth has been acceptable. ", " Inflation control, however, is not the only consideration in gauging the appropriate rate of average wage growth. It is possible to maintain low inflation, but still have wages growth which is too high to encourage job creation. This can happen for a variety of reasons. Wage bargaining generally may not be very responsive to unemployment; wage bargains in a particular leading sector may reflect conditions in that sector, but then be transmitted, through concerns about relativities, into other sector s which experience quite different conditions; wage negotiator s may have unduly high expectations of future inflation in mind when striking their bargains. In any of these cases, a tendency for costs to rise limits the speed of short-term economic growth which is consistent with inflation control, and is therefore detrimental to unemployment performance. ", " Overall wages growth in Australia is, to a degree, sensitive to the state of the labour market: average wages growth slowed from about <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> in 1995 to closer to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4      per cent</span> in 1996, though the latest data suggest this slowing may have ended. The international comparisons shown here suggest, however, that growth in unit labour costs in Australia has still been on the high side over the past couple of years, given the rate of unemployment. ", " The real interest rate is a concept which takes account of the fact that inflation in prices reduces the effective cost of borrowing and the return to lending. Measures of real interest rates typically deduct an inflation component from some ‘nominal’ interest rate. ", " There is no unique way of calculating a real interest rate because different borrowers pay different real costs of borrowing, depending on the term and degree of risk of the loan. In addition, borrowing and lending are <em>forward-looking</em> decisions: borrowers are making judgments about their future capacity to service debt, while lenders are making decisions about future returns. Computations of real interest rates should really be made by deducting an <em>expectation</em> of <em>future</em>, rather than past, inflation from the relevant nominal interest rate. ", " Because these expectations are hard to measure, past inflation is often used in practice as a proxy for expected inflation, but it is important to remember that this may not be accurate. For example, with a cash rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> at end April, and underlying inflation at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span>, the real cash rate estimated this way is <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.9 per cent</span>. Surveys, however, show that businesses and consumers expect a higher rate of inflation – typically in the range of 3 to 4 per cent – which would imply a correspondingly lower estimate of the real cash rate – about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 to 3 per cent</span>. These differences point to the difficulty of making fine judgments about the level of real interest rates at a given point in time. ", " Proxies for real interest rates can be more useful over long periods, particularly where there are pronounced differences in the prevailing inflation rate and large movements in nominal interest rates and inflation expectations. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 1</span> illustrates the nominal cash rate and two measures of the ‘real’ cash rate over a decade – one using the past year's underlying inflation to proxy expected inflation and the other using consumers' expectations as recorded in the Melbourne Institute survey. The much lower nominal interest rate structure prevailing in Australia in the 1990s reflects, in part, the large decline in inflation since the late 1980s. But real cash rates are also considerably lower now than in the 1980s. On either measure of real cash rates shown here, they are well below the average of the second half of the 1980s; they have declined since their most recent peak in 1995, but remain above the low point reached in 1993/94. ", " Although the real cash rate can be a useful summary measure of monetary policy, rates on offer from banks and other intermediaries are more relevant for borrowing decisions of businesses and individuals. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 2</span> shows nominal and real measures of banks' business lending and mortgage rates. The compression of bank margins in recent years means that, unlike the cash rate, real bank rates on business loans are close to their cyclical troughs in 1993 while real mortgage rates are below their previous troughs. ", " Comparisons are often made of real interest rates across countries. Such comparisons, which typically use actual past inflation as a proxy for expected inflation, currently show Australia as having relatively high real interest rates. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Table 1</span> illustrates. ", " Australian real short rates are higher than in most of the major economies. There are, however, two things to keep in mind when drawing this comparison. ", " The first is that the differences in real interest rates reflect differences in current macroeconomic conditions. In continental Europe, Canada and Japan, economies have been characterised by very low rates of both economic growth and inflation (driven importantly by very low rates of wages growth). Their monetary policy is set in a more expansionary way to reflect this situation, and their real interest rates, accordingly, are lower than those in Australia. ", " The second difficulty is that while using recent actual inflation, rather than inflationary expectations, to construct an approximation of real interest rates might be reasonably accurate for countries with a long history of low inflation, it is less accurate for Australia and may therefore lead to an overstatement of real interest rates in Australia. ", " The longer-term inflation track record is important in the bond market, where the central bank has no direct impact on the level of interest rates. Using actual inflation over the past five years as a proxy for longer-term inflation expectations, Australian real rates are relatively high in international terms. Other English-speaking countries with a long-term history of high inflation – such as Canada, the UK and New Zealand – also have long-term real interest rates higher than the average. These ‘real’ interest rates probably still embody some inflation premium. Even though Australia's average inflation performance over the past five years has been superior to those of the traditional low-inflation countries, international markets still require compensation for inflation uncertainty, because of Australia's longer-term history. It takes a long time to build up low-inflation credibility. ", " Competition in the provision of housing finance has increased over the past year, with banks announcing two rounds of cuts in housing interest rates (in June 1996 and February 1997) independent of any easings in monetary policy. The combination of these reductions and banks' responses to the three easings of monetary policy in the second half of 1996 has seen interest rates on variable-rate mortgages fall by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 percentage points</span> in the past year. The standard variable rate is now at <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.55 per cent</span>, its lowest level since late 1973 (Graph 1). ", " While financial deregulation a decade ago opened up the way for greater competition in the provision of finance, the full impact was not felt until recent years, particularly for households. One reason for this was that inflation remained high in the 1980s. The resulting high level of interest rates in the wholesale money market, the main source of funds for lenders such as mortgage managers, made it difficult for potential new lenders to compete with banks, who had access to low-cost retail funding. This situation enabled banks to sustain wide margins on housing lending, largely uncontested by other institutions. The return to low inflation and the fall in money market interest rates opened up the way for new institutions to enter the market, since there was then sufficient margin between money market interest rates and the rates charged by banks on housing loans for these new lenders to undercut banks <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 2)</span>. The development of markets for securitised assets facilitated the funding activities of mortgage managers. ", " Mortgage managers were slow to start but by the end of the first half of the 1990s, they were gaining substantial market share from other lenders. By mid 1996, their share of new lending had risen to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent (Graph 3)</span>. Correspondingly, banks' market share fell by 10 percentage points from over <span class=\"no-wrap\">90 per cent</span> of new loans in early 1994 to over 80 per cent in mid 1996. ", " Banks initially responded to the competition from mortgage managers by product innovation aimed at new borrowers, rather than cutting their main standard variable interest rates. This latter course would have been more costly to banks as it would have passed on lower rates to existing as well as new customers. New facilities included ‘honeymoon’ loans, a wider range of fixed-rate loans and the introduction of ‘basic’ loans at substantial discounts to the standard variable-rate home loan, with similar conditions to those offered by mortgage managers. Signs of more general competition on housing rates emerged in late 1994, when banks responded to the rise of 2¾ percentage points in cash rates by raising housing rates by only 1¾ percentage points. Banks accommodated this smaller rise mainly by limiting the rise in interest rates on deposits. ", " Competition spread more openly to the market for existing borrowers in mid 1996 when banks cut the interest rate on standard variable-rate loans independently of any effect on funding costs from a change in monetary policy. Several banks also introduced incentives to refinance existing loans – for example, waiving fees and loan establishment costs – with the aim of attracting borrowers from their competitors. A similar episode occurred in February of this year. In total, the standard variable rate was lowered by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ percentage</span> points over and above the falls that accompanied the three monetary policy easings. ", " The result of this competition, which originated from the entry of new non-bank lenders into the market, is that banks have reduced their standard mortgage rates to match those of the new entrants. Some banks are offering ‘no-frills’ or basic loans at rates lower than those offered by key mortgage managers. In the process, banks' margins on housing loans, which had been high by international standards, have come down significantly in the past year (Graph 4). They are now more in line with those in comparable overseas countries. "], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/1997/may/1.html"},
{"Date": ["Reserve Bank Bulletin – August 1997"], "Section": [" ", " Quarterly Report on the Economy and Financial Markets "], "Text": [" Inflation in Australia has declined over recent quarters, and is now running below <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, compared with over <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> a year ago. This decline owes something to an appreciation of the Australian dollar during 1996, but is also being assisted by some further decline in rates of growth of labour costs. Inflationary expectations have also declined, as it is increasingly accepted that low inflation will be a permanent feature of the economic scene in Australia. These trends, and the Bank's assessment that inflation is likely to remain quite low for some time ahead, have provided scope for lower interest rates, and the Bank has eased monetary policy twice since the time of the Semi-Annual Statement to Parliament in early May. ", " The increasing evidence that low inflation is being maintained – which is a feature of the business and economic environment globally – makes for a sound base for economic expansion. Since the beginning of the recovery from recession around the middle of 1991, the economy has experienced six years of uninterrupted growth. Growth began slowing to below-trend rates during 1995, a process which continued in 1996 and, as a result, business conditions in many areas have been lacklustre and employment growth weak. While this slowing has been relatively mild in comparison with other mid-expansion lulls, a corollary of it is that unemployment, having fallen from over <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span> to around 8½ per cent, has marked time for about two years now. ", " Growth is gradually picking up, however, with the rate of expansion in the first half of 1997 ahead of that in the second half of 1996. It is more likely that growth will gradually accelerate further than that it will slow down, particularly once any dampening effects of fiscal consolidation begin to wane. A number of supportive factors are in place. Monetary policy is providing some expansionary impetus: the structure of interest rates for most borrowers is lower now than at the previous low point in 1993, including in ‘real’ terms. The world economic environment continues to be broadly supportive, with steady, low-inflationary growth in the United States economy and a stable policy environment, and continued growth in a number of other trading partners. (Admittedly, growth prospects in some of the east Asian economies may be affected by recent financial instability.) Domestically, while businesses have had to work hard to earn profits, the improving cost structure in many areas makes for a sound investment environment. Business confidence, although not strong, seems to have been improving, particularly expectations about future conditions. As these factors exert their influence over the coming year, further acceleration in growth can be expected to be accompanied by a resumption in employment growth and a further reduction in the rate of unemployment. ", " The recent slowing of wages growth will also be a welcome help in this regard. On the latest reading, ordinary-time earnings growth has slowed to an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3¾ per cent</span> and, allowing for some likely measurement distortions, wage rates at an aggregate level may be increasing more slowly than that. Growth of wages and salaries in leading-edge sectors – enterprise bargains and executive salaries – appear also to have slowed a little, on the most recent data. These developments are, presumably, a response both to the softer labour market conditions of the past year or two and the decline in price inflation. A continuation of these trends would assure containment of labour costs in the period ahead. The outcome of important arbitrated wage claims, particularly the Safety-Net Review, will also be helpful in containing labour costs and supporting employment. ", " With aggregate wage pressures easing, inflation expectations declining, and ample spare capacity in the economy, the Bank judged that there were no major inflationary risks on the horizon, and that monetary policy could be eased to provide further support for growth. Of the two easings in the past three months, the first was a surprise to financial markets. Within a short period, however, markets came not only to accept it, but equally quickly to anticipate the second reduction. The response of yields across the curve, and of the exchange rate, were more or less as expected. ", " The present setting of policy also embodies a judgment that even if growth in demand turned out to be a little higher than expected, the economy has scope, in the short term at least, to respond without serious inflation consequences. ", " Indicators continue to point to firmer growth in economic activity during 1997 than was recorded in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">previous year</span>, although the extent of the pick-up has been more difficult to judge in the most recent months. In the March quarter of 1997, non-farm GDP increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.8 per cent</span> and total GDP by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.9 per cent</span>, the strongest quarterly result for a year. Non-farm GDP growth over the year to March, at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span>, was below trend, but this mainly reflected weakness in the second half of 1996 (Graph 1). ", " The pick-up reflected strong growth in all the main areas of private spending, including the early stages of the housing upturn, along with continuing strong growth in business investment and faster consumption growth. Private final demand increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.2 per cent</span> in the quarter and has, in fact, been picking up for some time, reaching a growth rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.9 per cent</span> over the year to the March quarter. Exports were also reasonably strong in the March quarter after slower growth in 1996. These areas of strength have been offset to some extent by weaker public demand as well as by a sizeable reduction in stocks (Table 1). This stock run-down should help to set the stage for stronger activity later in the year, although stock levels in the manufacturing industry appear still to be above trend. ", " Information available for the June quarter suggests a further expansion in demand and output, although not at the same pace. While business investment continues to grow strongly, and the housing sector upswing is moving ahead, growth in private consumption appears to have been weaker from March through to June after a strong start to the year. In the year ahead, the degree of momentum in housing and business construction investment will be important determinants of the economy's growth path. Also important for the achievement of a balanced expansion will be a surer trend in consumer demand, and a resumption of stronger growth in exports to the Asian region. A detailed discussion of the domestic economy follows. ", " Business investment has now been showing solid growth for a period of around five years, and has been an important engine of growth in the current expansion. The growth has been broadly based for much of that time, encompassing strong growth in the manufacturing, mining and service industries, private-sector infrastructure and non-residential construction developments. More recently, investment growth has begun to be more heavily concentrated in construction rather than plant and equipment. Over the year to the March quarter, real growth in aggregate business investment was <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span>, with the plant and equipment component growing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> and construction by 25 per cent. ", " Forward indicators of investment plans suggest that this compositional shift is likely to continue, with an easing in the pace of aggregate investment growth while the construction component is expected to remain strong. The latest capital expenditure survey, conducted in April and May, shows construction expenditure in 1997/98 expected to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span> higher than the corresponding set of estimates taken a year earlier. The figure for the plant and equipment component is a fall in expected investment of 8 per cent over the same period, which would leave total investment broadly flat <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 2)</span>. While these expectations can be subject to substantial revision, they imply a somewhat weaker outlook than presented in the previous survey taken in January/February. Nonetheless, a strong outlook for construction activity remains a consistent feature of the survey results. In addition, recent growth in imports of investment goods gives a somewhat firmer impression of equipment investment than the capital expenditure survey expectations. ", " Other forward indicators of construction activity confirm the outlook for strong growth in that area (Graph 3). Non-residential building commencements, although volatile, continue to trend upward, and there have been rapid rises during the past year in both work done and work outstanding. Unlike the pattern in the construction boom of the late 1980s, the stock of work outstanding is broadly spread across offices, shops, hotels and other business premises. Olympic-related work should provide further support to demand for some time, and there are some other large projects committed which are yet to show up in the commencements figures. Declining office vacancy rates in several major cities suggest a strengthening underlying demand for office premises, although vacancy rates remain at relatively high levels in most cities. ", " The outlook for engineering construction activity is also for solid growth. Commencements still seem to be trending upward despite recent volatility, and the stock of work yet to be done remains at a very high level. Much of this strength is related to the mining sector, particularly in base-metals projects, along with private-sector infrastructure projects such as CityLink in Victoria. Looking further ahead, the Access investment monitor suggests that there remains a high value of mining and resource-related projects which are under consideration by companies. This should help underpin investment growth for some time. ", " The weaker expectation for equipment investment over the next year is concentrated mainly in the manufacturing sector, where expected investment according to the Capital Expenditure Survey is <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span> below the level of a year ago. The weaker manufacturing outlook reflects several factors, including the cumulative impact of very low rates of increase in selling prices, combined with continuing high wage settlements in many parts of the sector, which have contributed to declining profitability and relatively weak business confidence. Also important is that capacity utilisation is relatively low, following several years of strong investment growth and a period of weaker growth in sales. A high stock-to-sales ratio relative to the longer-run downward trend also suggests that manufacturers may still have a significant stock overhang (Graph 4). ", " Notwithstanding these factors, some surveys suggest that confidence in the manufacturing sector may have begun to pick up from its recent low levels. Factors that may contribute to a more positive outlook include the continuing effects of interest-rate reductions and the expected strong growth in housing and construction which should contribute to stronger sales growth in the period ahead. ", " At an economy-wide level, business confidence and the climate for investment seem to be undergoing some modest improvement (Graph 5), supported by firming expectations of sales and profits. Aggregate business profitability, although declining moderately over the past two years, remains at reasonably good levels by historical standards. <em>Gross operating surplus</em> of the corporate sector fell slightly in the March quarter to a level equivalent to <span class=\"no-wrap\">14.8 per cent</span> of GDP, only just below its decade average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">14.9 per cent</span>. Profits after interest showed little change in the March quarter, but can be expected to benefit over time from the effects of interest rate reductions that have taken place over the past year, as these flow through into profit results. Profits of unincorporated businesses have been showing modest improvement over the past year. ", " As already noted, profits in manufacturing industry have been weaker than those for the economy as a whole, declining by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over the past two years (Table 2). Profits in wholesale and retail trade have also performed considerably below average in the recent period, while profits in mining, transport and services have grown strongly. These trends are broadly reflected in the industry mix of investment intentions, which are strongest in the finance, property and other service industries, predominantly on the building side, and relatively weak in manufacturing. Mining investment remains at a high level and has grown by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span> since late 1995. ", " Recent trends in business funding suggest a slowing in the pace of balance-sheet expansion. Total business funding from domestic sources, comprising retained profits, equity raisings by listed companies and business borrowing from financial intermediaries, fell from <span class=\"no-wrap\">15¼ per cent</span> of GDP in the December quarter to <span class=\"no-wrap\">14½ per cent</span> in March, despite a small pick-up in retained earnings (Graph 6). The flow of new intermediated debt to the corporate sector has eased back from a run of strong quarterly readings, and is now around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span> of GDP, very close to its decade average. Moderate business credit growth points to a continuation of this trend in the June quarter. The volume of new equity raisings eased in the March quarter following a strong December quarter figure. The overall level of corporate funding appears consistent with expectations of more modest investment growth in the near term. ", " The upward trend in the forward indicators of housing activity, evident since at least the start of this year, has been continuing. Notwithstanding a decline in the past two months, the number of private building approvals in the June quarter reached a level around <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> higher than the average in the second half of 1996, and this is beginning to flow through into rises in commencements (Graph 7). Housing finance indicators suggest a strong upward trend. In the June quarter, loan approvals for existing dwellings were <span class=\"no-wrap\">35 per cent</span> higher than in the June quarter last year and loan approvals for new construction were up by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span>. The housing expansion is being supported by historically high levels of affordability, but a continuing supply overhang in a number of areas suggests that the pace of expansion is likely to remain below the average of previous cycles. ", " A feature of the current housing expansion is that it has been unevenly distributed both geographically and in its composition between houses and medium-density dwellings. The medium-density sector picked up quite sharply in the eastern States in early 1996, well ahead of the more general upturn in housing activity (Graph 8). Strong investor demand in this area reflected rising dwelling rents, as well as an apparent shift in preferences towards inner city living and relatively low and declining vacancy rates for private rental accommodation in Sydney and Melbourne. Between the March quarters of 1996 and 1997, medium-density building approvals in the eastern States increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">65 per cent</span>. Elsewhere in Australia they were still declining over that period. ", " More recently the housing upturn has shown signs of spreading more widely geographically and has shifted in composition towards private houses. The number and value of approvals to build private houses has grown quite rapidly through the first half of 1997, even abstracting from the contribution of the Olympics project, although the May and June figures were weaker. Medium-density approvals, in contrast, have plateaued around the levels reached in the December quarter. Related to this, housing loan approvals for investors have also been falling in recent months. Signs that medium-density housing activity may be in for a period of slower growth include recent falls in rents in some areas and a levelling out in vacancy rates; in Sydney, where the increase in medium-density supply has been strongest, vacancy rates have, on some measures, actually started to rise. ", " At the same time as this compositional shift is occurring, overall demand for housing, and the shift from rental to home ownership, continue to be underpinned by very high levels of home-loan affordability. Mortgage interest rates following the latest easing in cash rates have come down to levels of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">6½–6¾ per cent</span>, the lowest since the early 1970s. With repayment burdens associated with house purchases now at historically low levels, there is no doubt that this is providing significant stimulus to the housing market. ", " Strong demand for housing has also been putting upward pressure on house prices in some cities, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne (Graph 9). According to the measure published by the REIA, average house prices in Sydney in the March quarter were <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> higher than a year ago, while the rise in Melbourne over the same period was <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span>. More recent monthly data from the same source are highly volatile but point to further increases. These measures of house prices can, however, be affected by increased activity at the upper end of the market, where price increases to date seem to have been concentrated. There are still signs of surplus supply in the outer suburbs of both cities. The ABS measure of house prices, which excludes the top and bottom <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> of the market, shows more moderate price increases in Sydney and Melbourne, although some tendency for these increases to gather pace is still evident. In the other capital cities, house prices have been more subdued, although the REIA data are suggesting some pick-up in Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth since <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1996</span>. ", " Some degree of upward pressure on house prices can be considered a normal part of the transmission process whereby an increase in demand flows through into increased building activity. Higher demand tends to be focused at least partly on the existing stock of houses and leads to a bidding up of prices, particularly in areas where supply is relatively short; over time, the stronger demand can be met by increased building activity. At this stage, the rises in house prices have been reasonably localised and do not seem to indicate any general increase in inflationary expectations, although this will be an area to be watched as the housing upturn continues. ", " Household consumption spending picked up strongly in the early part of 1997, but seems to have lost momentum in more recent months. Retail trade grew by just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in real terms in the March quarter after being flat for much of the previous year; it then showed a small fall in the June quarter (Graph 10). Interpretation of this pattern is made difficult by the volatility of the underlying monthly numbers, including some unusually large fluctuations around Christmas and Easter. These have probably had the net effect of drawing spending into the March quarter from before and after that period, and therefore exaggerating both the pick-up in the March quarter and the subsequent weakness. The June monthly figure was also affected by the delay of mid-year sales by some major retailers, which should help boost the July figures. A more realistic assessment may therefore be that consumption was growing in trend terms throughout the first half of the year, with the pace stronger in the March than in the June quarter. A continuing uptrend is evident in motor vehicle registrations, which rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.7 per cent</span> in the June quarter following growth of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.9 per cent</span> in the March quarter. The higher level of registrations partly reflects the effects of falls in motor vehicle prices occurring over the past year as a result of earlier exchange-rate appreciation. ", " The trend in consumer spending over the past two years has been influenced by a gradual decline in the rate of growth of household incomes which, in turn, reflected weaker employment growth and a moderation in wage outcomes. This has been combined with an apparent desire on the part of consumers to at least maintain their levels of saving after saving rates had fallen to historically low levels. Spending was boosted in the March quarter by a small decline in saving, but the indications are that consumers remain fairly cautious and are quite pessimistic about labour-market prospects. A more sustained pick-up in spending will require stronger growth in household incomes, which in turn will be dependent on a resumption of employment growth. ", " While housing saving rates have shown only small movements recently, household assets and liabilities have continued to expand. On the asset side, this has mainly reflected accumulation of earnings in managed investment funds while, on the liabilities side, it reflects the growth of housing-related borrowing. Financial assets of the household sector grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">11.2 per cent</span> over the year to the March quarter, with growth concentrated in superannuation funds and other managed investments (Graph 11). These investments have continued to earn high average rates of return. Holdings of more traditional deposit products grew more slowly, by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.1 per cent</span> over the same period. ", " Household liabilities have also expanded faster than income, reaching a level of <span class=\"no-wrap\">94 per cent</span> of aggregate household income in the March quarter. This ratio continues to trend upward, but remains moderate by international standards. Housing credit growth has picked up recently, reaching an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">12.1 per cent</span> over the six months to June, compared with <span class=\"no-wrap\">9.6 per cent</span> over the previous six months. Other personal credit growth has also picked up slightly in recent months. Notwithstanding the increases in debt ratios, household interest payments have been declining as a proportion of income, reflecting interest rate reductions over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>. ", " Performance of the labour market so far in 1997 has been lacklustre, with little net change in total employment since the start of the year, notwithstanding the stronger figure in July (Graph 12). Part-time employment has continued to trend upwards, but this has been offset by declining full-time employment, which weakened further in the first half of 1997 before a rebound in July. The unemployment rate has remained within a range either side of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span> for the past two years, while labour force participation rates have been declining. ", " The levelling out of total employment in the first half of 1997 follows a period of around 18 months when employment grew at an annual rate of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>. This change in trend in 1997 seems to have reflected, at least in part, the slowing of overall economic growth in the preceding half year. Growth in non-farm product in the second half of 1996 slowed to an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> – not much more than average productivity growth has been in the current cycle, and insufficient to generate sustained growth in employment. In that sense, the slowing of employment growth should be viewed as having a significant cyclical component which can be expected to respond as the general pace of activity picks up. ", " Another important factor in the demand for labour, however, is the growth of labour costs. For much of the recent period, ordinary-time earnings and other measures of wage rates have been growing at rates of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> or more, while output prices have been rising much more slowly: for example, the fixed-weight GDP deflator in the year to the March quarter rose by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.3 per cent</span>, while manufacturers' output prices have been rising at rates of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>. The combination of high wage rises and flat selling prices is likely to have contributed to pressure on employers to contain costs through employment reductions and the substitution of capital for labour. Consistent with this view, business surveys have for some time been suggesting a strong preference to expand output through productivity growth rather than employment growth. Against this background, the recent easing of wage pressures in response to weaker labour market conditions is a welcome development which, if sustained, should help increase the willingness of businesses to increase employment as the economy picks up. ", " There have been some sharp differences in employment trends across industries over the past year. Growth has been weakest in some cyclically sensitive industries and in industries affected by fiscal consolidation or privatisations, such as public administration, education and utilities. Some of these effects probably still have a way to run, although prospects for a cyclical pick-up in employment in the construction industry appear to be good. Employment growth has remained relatively firm in a number of private-sector service industries, particularly business services and the hospitality industry. ", " More forward-looking indicators of labour demand continue to point to the prospect of some improvement. The number of private-sector job vacancies increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> over the three months to May, continuing the upward trend evident for the past two years, and bringing the level of vacancies not far short of the peak reached in 1994 (Graph 13). The ANZ measure of job vacancies, although showing an uneven pattern in recent months, has been on a rising trend, to be up by <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> since the beginning of the year. Business surveys suggest that near-term hiring intentions have picked up recently, although they remain at only moderate levels. ", " Imports and exports both grew strongly in the June quarter, although the export growth was driven largely by two special factors, the sale of an ANZAC frigate to New Zealand and the sale of gold by the Reserve Bank. Both of these items represent sales from existing stocks and they do not therefore contribute to growth of production in the June quarter. Allowing for that, net exports are expected to detract from growth in the June quarter, while the balance on goods and services, excluding the special factors, is expected to move into deficit after being in surplus for most of 1996. ", " The statistical treatment of the Reserve Bank gold sales involves reclassification of the gold from a financial asset to a produced asset, and then the sale of this commodity to a non-resident. The sale is recorded as an export in the balance of payments when it changes ownership; this took place mostly in the June quarter but some will also occur in the September quarter. The reclassification of the gold as a produced asset means that it is counted as part of public authorities' stocks at the time it was sold. There is therefore a reduction in stocks equal to the increase in exports, and no net effect on GDP. ", " Growth in the quantity of imports shows fairly clear signs of having picked up through 1997, reflecting healthy levels of domestic demand and the rise in the exchange rate during 1996. The quantity of imports of goods and services is estimated to have risen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> in the June quarter, following little growth in the March quarter. While growth has been reasonably broadly based, it has been particularly strong for consumption and capital goods imports. The pick-up in consumption goods imports has been spread across most durable components and is consistent with higher anticipated levels of consumer demand and some degree of stock rebuilding on the part of wholesalers and retailers. Strength in capital goods imports has now been evident for two quarters, and may suggest a firmer trend for plant and equipment investment than is implied in the recent capital expenditure survey. In the June quarter, growth was particularly strong in imports of telecommunications equipment, which may be related to the next phase of deregulation of the telecommunications industry. ", " The quantity of exports of goods and services is estimated to have increased by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> in the June quarter, driven predominantly by the export of the ANZAC frigate and the Reserve Bank's gold sales. Excluding these special factors, export growth was about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, with weakness in rural and resource exports offset by reasonable strength in exports of manufactures and services in the quarter. But, despite a reasonably strong March quarter, export growth, in an underlying sense, has been sluggish since early 1996. ", " A somewhat higher exchange rate is one factor likely to have made some contribution to this weakness in export growth. From the beginning of 1996 to the present, the exchange rate has averaged 58 in trade-weighted terms, which is close to its decade average but around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> higher than the average level over the previous four years. Also important has been the slowdown in growth of east Asian trade (Graph 14). Slowing in growth of output and trade volumes in the east Asian region has occurred for a variety of reasons, including a need to combat problems of overheating in some economies and a slump in the world electronics market. This appears to have had an impact on sales of Australian exports in the region, independently of the effect of exchange-rate movements; growth in exports of resource products, which do not tend to be very sensitive to the exchange rate, has slowed significantly since late 1995. ", " An expansion of exports to a range of smaller non-traditional markets (details are shown in Table 3) as well as <span class=\"no-wrap\">the US</span>, has partially offset this weakness; around <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> of the growth in exports that has occurred over the past two years can be attributed to growth in exports to these markets. To some extent, this strong growth is due to factors (such as the growth in cereal exports associated with the record 1996/97 wheat harvest) that will probably not be repeated. However, structural changes, including trade liberalisation, could further raise the importance of these markets in the future, although perhaps not at the same rate as in the past couple of years. ", " Total credit provided to the private sector by financial intermediaries rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">9.8 per cent</span> in the six months to June. This represents a small pick-up from the pace around the beginning of the year, but overall credit is still growing more slowly than in the first half of 1996. Within the total, business credit appears to have slowed a little in recent months, while housing credit has clearly picked up to be now growing at rates of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent (Table 4)</span>. ", " After some years on a downward trend, growth in currency has increased strongly in 1997, to an annualised growth rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.2 per cent</span> in the six months to June, compared with just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the previous <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span>. In part, this may reflect declines in the opportunity cost of holding currency: as inflation and nominal interest rates fall, some switching from transactions-type accounts into cash holdings is to be expected. Increases in bank fees on deposits may also have encouraged higher currency holdings by households in order to economise on banking transactions. Any switching behaviour would not show up in broad money, which includes both currency and deposits; both broad money and M3 have been growing at average annual rates of <span class=\"no-wrap\">9–10 per cent</span> for some time. They slowed marginally in the latter part of 1996 and have been growing slightly more quickly so far in 1997. ", " Inflation declined further in the June quarter, dropping below <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in underlying terms. Underlying consumer prices increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the quarter, and by 1.7 per cent over the year, down from an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span> in March and well below the recent peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span> in the March quarter 1996 (Graph 15). Other measures of trend inflation, such as the trimmed mean and median price increases, show a similar profile over time, and currently put inflation at close to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. ", " The rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has fallen much more sharply than measures of underlying inflation, reflecting the impact of mortgage interest rate reductions. The CPI fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span> in the quarter, bringing the year-ended increase to <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span>, down from <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.3 per cent</span> in the March quarter. The falls in mortgage interest rates announced since February detracted 0.5 of a percentage point from the quarterly CPI inflation rate, and a further negative contribution will follow from the most recent interest rate cut, thus continuing to keep annual CPI increases below the underlying inflation rate for some time. ", " Other measures of prices have been more subdued than the underlying CPI. Prices of domestically produced manufactured goods increased by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.1 per cent</span> over the year to May and house building materials prices by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.4 per cent</span> over the year to June. This continues a period of very low rates of increase in these prices over the past couple of years, although they have picked up a little in recent months. Input prices for manufactures, both domestically produced and imported, have over the past year been falling. The fixed-weight deflators for final consumption and GDP from the national accounts rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span> and 1.3 per cent over the year to the March quarter. ", " Appreciation of the exchange rate over much of the past two years has made a significant contribution to inflation reduction. One measure of this is that prices of predominantly <em>imported</em> goods in the CPI fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.7 per cent</span> over the past year (Graph 16). The exchange rate has declined in recent months, after having briefly been above <span class=\"no-wrap\">61 in trade-weighted</span> terms in March and again early in May 1997. These high levels were not sustained for long enough, however, to have had a significant effect on import prices (Graph 17). The TWI average value over both the March and June quarters was around 59, only slightly above its level of 58¼ at the end of July. If the exchange rate remains at current levels, it would imply relative stability in prices for imported consumer goods, or even some further small declines over the next few quarters, as a result of the continuing (although diminishing) response to earlier exchange rate appreciation. ", " Notwithstanding the important contribution of the exchange rate to recent trends, domestically sourced inflation also appears to be in check. Prices of non-imported goods increased by just <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.1 per cent</span> in the June quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.2 per cent</span> over the year, marking a clear deceleration from the position of a year earlier. Services prices (excluding interest charges) have been rising somewhat faster than domestic goods prices, but these increases have nonetheless been diminishing. The prices of private-sector services increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span> in the June quarter, and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.2 per cent</span> over the year. The annual figure is higher than in the March quarter, but well down on the rates recorded a year ago, a trend consistent with the easing in private-sector wages growth over the same period. ", " Wage pressures at an aggregate level have eased in recent months, probably reflecting a period of weaker labour market conditions as well as declines in inflation expectations. The increase in average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) slowed, on preliminary estimates, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.7 per cent</span> over the year to May, down from a rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.3 per cent</span> in February (Graph 18); the quarterly increase was just <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span>. While these data are prone to revision, there appears to be a break from a succession of quarterly increases of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>. ", " While AWOTE seems conceptually the best of the available published indicators of short-term wage developments, it contains some potential measurement errors that need to be taken into account in assessing its implications for inflation. The most important of these at present concerns the measurement of public-sector wages. For some time, the public-sector component of AWOTE (and other measures of weekly earnings) has been recorded as growing at unrealistically high levels – more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> over the year to February. This contrasts with the fairly extensive information available on enterprise agreements in the public sector – which cover the bulk of the public-sector workforce. Those data suggest earnings growth of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4½ per cent</span>. This comparison suggests that total AWOTE growth has been overstated, assuming that there is no offsetting measurement error in the private-sector component of AWOTE. Another possible source of error, specific to the AWOTE measure, is a trend increase in standard ordinary-time hours, which would tend to make the increase in weekly ordinary-time earnings a slight overstatement of the trend in hourly wage rates. This combination of factors suggests that hourly wage rates may be growing more slowly than the <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.7 per cent</span> officially recorded over the most recent year. ", " Broader measures of wage growth also point to lower rates of increase recently (Table 5). Total weekly earnings of adults working full time grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.1 per cent</span> over the latest year, and average weekly earnings of all employees increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.5 per cent</span>. These measures are also subject to error. For example, average weekly earnings are influenced by a trend increase in the share of employment accounted for by part-time workers, who have lower weekly earnings; this would tend to lead to an understatement of the increase in hourly wage rates. Nonetheless, all of these earnings measures are showing significantly lower rates of increase than were evident a year ago. ", " There are also signs of a slight decline in rates of increase in executive earnings and in wage increases negotiated under enterprise agreements. According to the Cullen Egan Dell survey, executive salaries increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.8 per cent</span> over the year to June, down from a rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.3 per cent</span> a year ago, although still well above community average income growth. There are no new official data on enterprise-bargaining outcomes beyond the March quarter, when new private-sector agreements yielded average wage increases of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.8 per cent;</span> this represented a modest slowing, from an estimated peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.3 per cent</span> in the previous year (Graph 19). Anecdotal reports of recent claims and settlements suggest that while many enterprise agreements are continuing to yield increases of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span>, significantly smaller increases may be becoming more common. ", " Award wages have continued to grow relatively slowly, rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> over the year to the June quarter, much the same pace as in the past few years. The $10 safety-net increase approved in the national wage case in April will most likely raise that rate of increase slightly to just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the period ahead. Based on past patterns of award adjustment, the decision will have its main impact on awards in the September and December quarters, but the overall impact on trends in aggregate earnings is small. A claim for a further across-the-board ‘safety-net’ increase is expected to be heard early next year. ", " The <em>Workplace Relations Act</em>, which came into force this year, facilitates a new stream of individual <span class=\"no-wrap\">contract-making</span> through Australian Workplace Agreements. This facility has been available since March. The Employment Advocate has reported that, by end July, contracts had been approved at 46 firms covering <span class=\"no-wrap\">949 employees</span>, with contracts at a further 90 firms waiting for approval. ", " Measures of inflation expectations have undergone a further significant downward shift over the past few quarters. The shift has occurred across the community, including consumers, businesses and financial market participants. However, surveys suggest that business and consumer expectations remain higher than the Bank's inflation target. ", " Consumer inflation expectations, as recorded by the Melbourne Institute Survey, moved down sharply in the second half of 1996 and have maintained that low level, or even fallen further, in subsequent months (Graph 20). According to the survey, median expectations of inflation in July for the period a year ahead were <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span>, close to the lowest figure since the survey began in 1973. The average result for this survey in the past nine months was <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span>, a clear step down after it had fluctuated around a reasonably stable average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.3 per cent</span> over the previous five years. ", " Near-term expectations of business selling prices have remained subdued over the past year and have tended to weaken further on the most recent readings (Graph 21). According to the NAB survey, the average expected selling price increase for retailers for the September quarter is <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span>. Both the ACM and ACCI-Westpac surveys of the manufacturing sector report declines in the net balance of respondents expecting to increase selling prices in the September quarter. Longer-term business inflation expectations, as recorded in the NAB survey, have been broadly steady this year after declining sharply in 1996. The proportion of business respondents who expect inflation to average more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> over the rest of the decade declined slightly to <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span> in the June quarter, and has remained well below the roughly one-third of respondents in that category in <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 1996</span>. However, the most common expectation in businesses continues to be in the 3 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> range. ", " Inflation expectations of participants in financial markets have also been declining. A survey of financial market economists conducted by the Bank in July shows that their expectations of inflation out to mid 1998 have been revised downward in the wake of the latest wage and price data. The median forecast for underlying inflation in the year to June 1998 was revised to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.2 per cent</span>, from <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.6 per cent</span> in the previous survey; the CPI increase expected over the same period is <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.8 per cent</span>. Respondents to this survey expect some pick-up in underlying inflation over the subsequent year, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.9 per cent</span>. An indicator of longer-term market expectations, the indexed bond differential, also records a significant decline in inflation expectations over recent months. This indicator, by end July, was implying a 10-year inflation expectation of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¼ per cent</span>, in the lower half of the inflation target and well down from figures of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3–3½ per cent</span> that had prevailed a year earlier. ", " Developments over recent months have increased the likelihood that inflation will remain at low rates for some time. The June quarter results for prices confirm a fall of inflation below <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in underlying terms, and even some slight pick-up in quarterly rates of increase would leave underlying inflation no higher than <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the short term. ", " The recent fall in inflation has been helped by a firm exchange rate, and this factor is likely to wane over the coming year if the TWI remains at current levels (although the Bank does not expect that current levels of the exchange rate will add significantly to import prices). Over this period, then, the trend in domestic factors bearing on inflation will become more important. ", " Recent information about those factors generally points to a somewhat slower trend in domestic inflation than seemed likely six months ago. Most important in this has been the apparent easing in growth of labour costs, on several measures. As noted above, this is probably a response to the prolonged period in which labour market conditions have generally been weak. This more moderate trend, if continued, will make the outlook for both inflation and employment growth more secure. Stronger growth could, at some stage, be expected to lead to some pick up in growth of wages, but unless the growth in activity is especially rapid, this is likely to be gradual. Also important is the fall in inflation expectations, which should be expected to affect aspirations for wages and prices alike. ", " On the basis of this evidence, the Bank expects that underlying inflation will remain below <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> for some time ahead, probably into 1998. In the slightly longer term, some pick up in inflation might be expected in response to strengthening demand conditions which will wind back surplus capacity. Inflation is not expected, however, to exceed the target in the foreseeable future. ", " The rate of increase in the headline Consumer Price Index should remain well below the underlying inflation rate in year-ended terms until the middle of 1998, reflecting the impact of recent interest rate reductions. During 1997, CPI inflation rates will remain close to zero; to the extent that the headline CPI is still a focus of attention by wage and price setters, this could have a reinforcing effect on recent declines in inflation expectations. ", " The international economic scene appears, on the whole, supportive of continued good growth in Australia. For the OECD in aggregate, growth in 1997 and 1998 is expected to move up to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> before declining slightly. Growth is also expected to pick up in the east Asian region <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 6)</span>, although the rates of growth forecast for 1997 and 1998 are somewhat lower than those recorded earlier this decade, and prospects may be affected by financial fragility in a number of countries. ", " Macroeconomic outcomes in the United States continue to be highly favourable. Output has been expanding at a healthy pace for six years; both unemployment and inflation are low and have been trending down gradually. After growing very rapidly in the March quarter 1997, output in the June quarter rose by a more modest <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span>, to be up by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.1 per cent</span> over the year. Employment growth remains strong, with non-farm payrolls recording an average monthly rise of 246000 so far this year, compared with an average of 212000 in 1996. The unemployment rate fell below 6 per cent in September 1994 and has trended down since then to a rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.8 per cent</span> in July 1997. Core consumer price inflation has fallen gradually from <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.0 per cent</span> over the year to September 1994 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.4 per cent</span> currently <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 22)</span>. ", " This experience over the past 3 years stands in contrast to earlier episodes. The unemployment rate last fell below <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> in the late 1980s. Over the subsequent 3 years, core consumer price inflation increased by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> rather than trending down as it has in the current cycle. The difference in inflation outcomes in these two cycles has reflected the different behaviour of labour costs. In the late 1980s, growth in labour costs accelerated markedly as the unemployment rate trended down whereas, over the past three years, labour-cost growth has been much more subdued. As a consequence, the monetary policy responses in the two episodes were also quite different. The Federal funds rate was raised to nearly 10 per cent in response to inflationary pressures in the late 1980s, whereas in the current cycle it has remained at or below <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent;</span> currently it is at <span class=\"no-wrap\">5½ per cent</span>. ", " The strength of the Japanese economic recovery remains difficult to assess. GDP increased by 1.6 per cent in the March quarter, but much of that strength reflected private consumption being brought forward in anticipation of the sales tax rise on 1 April. In the aftermath of this tax rise, consumption indicators have been weak and the unemployment rate in May returned to its post-war peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span>. ", " Other indicators suggest that a firmer trend may be emerging. In the business sector, confidence has been improving since 1994. Over the past year, for the first time in five years, more large firms viewed business conditions as favourable than as unfavourable. Small firms, however, remain somewhat more pessimistic. The relative optimism of large firms arises, in part, because of their greater access to export markets relative to small firms. Export growth has been running at its highest rate in a decade, driven largely by the substantial depreciation of the yen since early 1995 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 23)</span>. ", " Prices in Japan remain stable. Core consumer prices rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.0 per cent</span> in the year to June, but the bulk of this reflected the effects of the April tax increases. Reflecting the combination of stable prices and weak demand, the short-term policy interest rate remains at its historically low level of ½ per cent. ", " In other east Asian economies, industrial production and trade growth began to recover in early 1997 following a much weaker period over the previous year (Graph 24). To what extent this recovery will be delayed by the effects of recent financial developments remains to be seen. Confidence in the region may have been adversely affected, at least temporarily, by the sharp movements in currencies and interest rates that followed the attack on the Thai baht. Moreover, in a number of countries in the region, the high interest rates needed to defend currencies may aggravate their domestic problems of financial fragility. This situation suggests there is some near-term risk to the prospect of a rapid recovery in east-Asian trade, which would also have consequences for Australia's exports. ", " In Europe there are significant divergences between the three largest economies (Germany, France and Italy) where growth has been rather subdued, and a periphery of faster-growing economies. In Germany, France and Italy, growth has remained insufficient to prevent an upward drift in unemployment rates to post-war highs in each country. Domestic price pressures are absent, with inflation under <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in all three countries. There are signs that growth is picking up in this continental core of countries, driven primarily by external demand which has been helped by weakening exchange rates, and a result in part of accommodating monetary policy. The signs of quickening growth are clearest in France and Germany; in Italy, output contracted slightly over the year to the March quarter 1997, although signs of recovery are now emerging. For each of these economies, however, it is anticipated that the pick-up in growth will be gradual. ", " Forming a periphery around this continental core of countries, a considerable number of European economies (of which the United Kingdom is the largest) have been growing quite strongly for several years. The economic output of these countries, taken together, is roughly the same as France and Italy combined, so their economic fortunes have an important bearing on Europe as a whole. In all of the countries that make up this periphery, unemployment has fallen over the past few years, although in some cases from a very high level (unemployment remains over 20 per cent in Spain and over <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> in Ireland and Finland). While inflation remains well-contained in all of these economies, price pressures are emerging in some of them, leading authorities to raise interest rates. OECD forecasts suggest that, in aggregate, these economies will continue over the next couple of years to grow more rapidly than the major continental European economies. ", " Commodity prices have declined since April, following firm rises in the March quarter. The fall has been concentrated in the rural sector, where prices have fallen by almost 8 per cent over the past couple of months. This fall mainly reflects lower wheat prices, which are down by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> since April, due to expectations of a large US wheat harvest. Stronger wool prices, driven by increased demand from Europe and China, have offset this weakness to some extent. ", " Non-rural prices have softened a little in recent months, mainly due to lower gold prices. Gold prices declined by almost 6 per cent in the June quarter and by around 15 per cent during 1996/97. Other non-rural commodities prices have been fairly stable since March. Base metal prices have consolidated their position after rising strongly in the March quarter, and now stand about 15 per cent higher than a year ago. This strength is consistent with solid growth in the United States and generally improving conditions in Europe and Japan. Oil prices have now stabilised at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$20 a barrel</span>, which is about their average level over the past five years. ", " Financial markets across all industrial countries, including Australia, remained very bullish in the June quarter, with bond yields falling and equity prices rising. While there were some country-specific factors at work, the underlying cause was the universal absence of inflationary pressures across the developed world, encouraging confidence that the current low structure of short-term interest rates, a feature of global markets in the 1990s, can be sustained. ", " Markets gained confidence from the ability so far of the US economy to operate at levels close to capacity without causing inflationary pressures. In this environment, there has been debate about whether, as a result of the advances in information technology, the world economy has entered a new phase characterised by an enhanced capacity for non-inflationary growth. This debate, of course, remains unresolved, but for the moment market participants seem prepared to bet that a new growth paradigm is a good possibility. ", " At this stage, it is difficult to know whether the sharp increases in market valuations over the past couple of years are soundly based, or simply the building of a speculative bubble. What is clear, however, is that markets require a continuation of good news on inflation, economic growth and profits to sustain current valuations. ", " In Australia, the falls in bond yields have been larger than elsewhere, as the wage pressures of 1996, which had been a cause of uncertainty in markets, have lessened. On the other hand, the Australian share market does not appear to have reached the high valuations evident in some other countries. The Bank's overall assessment of domestic financial developments was that they did not stand in the way of further easings of monetary policy. ", " In contrast to developments in industrial countries, emerging markets, particularly those in south east Asia, have been subject to a good deal of turbulence in recent months, with intense exchange rate pressures in a number of them. This follows some slowing in these economies after a prolonged period of very strong economic growth, which in some cases had produced a number of economic and financial imbalances. ", " For the reasons outlined earlier, the process of easing monetary policy in Australia, which was initiated in <span class=\"no-wrap\">July 1996</span>, continued in recent months. The Bank announced two further cuts of half a percentage point in the target cash rate, on 23 May and 30 July, taking this target to 5.0 per cent. This is only marginally above the low point for the cash rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.75 per cent</span> in 1993/94. ", " The May easing had not been anticipated by markets, and therefore had not been priced into various interest rates. As such, security yields fell by about 0.5 of a percentage point on the announcement, to levels consistent with the new cash rate target. In contrast, the July easing was fully anticipated (Graph 25). In fact, short-term security yields had begun to incorporate a monetary easing by early June. These expectations grew following weak employment figures and, later, the good inflation and wages results for the June quarter. By the time the easing was announced, the yield on 90-day bank bills had fallen to slightly over 5 per cent, and there was little further movement on the announcement. ", " These reductions in short-term interest rates resulted in a corresponding fall in the cost of banks' wholesale funding. On retail deposits, however, the current historically low structure of interest rates meant that banks' discretion to reduce rates was more limited. About a third of bank funding comes from retail deposits. The <em>level</em> of interest rates on many small transaction/statement accounts had already fallen to less than 1 per cent before May, implying that only a small part of any subsequent cuts in the cash rate could be reflected in these deposit rates; rates on transaction/savings accounts were reduced to 0.15 per cent in May. Rates paid on so-called ‘deeming’ accounts, offered to retired individuals and some social security recipients, are equivalent to the deeming rate set by the Department of Social Security for taxation purposes. This rate is currently set at 6 per cent for large balances, around a percentage point higher than money market rates paid by banks. With such a competitive interest rate, these accounts have attracted large inflows over the past year or so, and have held up banks' overall cost of funds. ", " All up, taking reductions in retail and wholesale funding costs into account, the Bank estimates that the cost of bank deposits fell by about 70 basis points as a result of the May and July easings, somewhat less than the combined fall in the cash rate. Such differences are not unusual; Graph 26 shows that the cash rate typically rises by more than banks' costs of funds when monetary policy is tightened, and falls by more when policy is eased, because banks raise some of their funds through no-interest deposits or deposits whose interest rates do not vary <em lang=\"la\">pari passu</em> with cash rates. In contrast, the cost of funds of banks' competitors, such as mortgage managers who fund themselves entirely in wholesale markets, tends to fall in line with the cash rate. ", " In a fully competitive market, it might be expected that banks would be forced to lower their lending rates by the full extent of the fall in the cash rate, squeezing their average margins. However, in response to the May easing, most banks announced reductions on standard variable loans by amounts roughly in line with the reduction in their overall cost of funds – i.e. less than the full cut in the cash rate. ", " This reflected the dynamics of the housing loan market at the time. Over the previous year, banks had been gaining market share from mortgage managers because they had substantially cut their interest rates on housing loans. In June 1996, and again in February 1997, banks cut the rate on standard variable housing loans by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.75 of a percentage</span> point independently of any change in monetary policy. As such, over the year to May 1997, interest rates on standard housing loans of banks had fallen by substantially more than the cash rate, to levels similar to those charged by mortgage managers. Consequently, banks began to recover the market share lost to mortgage managers in the preceding few years. Against this background, after the easing in May, banks were under less pressure to match fully the cuts announced by mortgage managers. ", " Subsequent figures have shown, however, that as a result of this and the adverse publicity that banks received, mortgage managers' share of new housing lending has increased sharply. Banks made a fuller response to the July easing, although again some did not pass on all of the cut in the cash rate. The predominant standard variable housing rate from banks is now <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.7 per cent</span>, 0.3 of a percentage point higher than the rate charged by mortgage managers. ", " Banks and other intermediaries these days offer a range of facilities for housing lending, and changes in rates charged on these other facilities have varied. Reductions in banks' ‘honeymoon’ rates ranged from no change at all to the full reduction in cash rates. The average ‘honeymoon’ rate is <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.0 per cent</span>, compared with 6.75 per cent at the beginning of May, although some rates are as low as 4.99 per cent. Interest rates on housing loans fixed for periods of three and five years, funding costs of which are determined in relevant swaps markets rather than by the cash rate, have fallen by around 100 basis points since early May. These rates now average <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.3 and 7.8 per cent</span>, respectively. ", " Notwithstanding the partial passing on to housing rates of the recent cuts in the cash rate, the overall effect of all the reductions over the past year or so is that the structure of bank housing interest rates is as low as it has been since 1970 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 27)</span>. The predominant rate is now 2 percentage points lower than in 1993, even though the cash rate is still a little above the cyclical low reached at that time. Competition in the housing loan market in Australia has produced spreads against funding costs which are slim by historical standards, and in line with those in other comparable countries. ", " In the case of <em>large business</em> loans, banks' responses to the two easings involved a reduction on average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">85 basis</span> points, taking the benchmark rate to around 8.5 per cent. Rates on loans to <em>small businesses</em> were generally lowered by the full percentage point reduction in the cash rate, with the typical indicator rate currently at 8.75 per cent. Further signs of growing competition for small business lending appeared in late July, when a mortgage manager announced a loan product for small businesses at a rate about 1 percentage point below banks' indicator rates at that time. As with housing rates, these moves have taken the structure of business lending rates below the level of 1993, then the lowest structure of business rates for two decades. ", " The latest cuts in banks' lending rates became effective with similar lags to those announced with the easings through the second half of 1996. These lags were longer than those associated with the increases in lending rates that followed the tightening of policy in 1994 (Table 7). For example, the average lag in lowering the interest rate on standard housing loans in May and July was about 7–8 weeks, compared with a lag of 2–3 weeks when banks raised rates in 1994. ", " Long-term interest rates in capital markets have also continued the downward trend evident over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Graph 28)</span>. A range of international and domestic factors worked, in concert, to reduce bond yields in Australia. Internationally, continuing good news on inflation saw expectations of further tightening in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United States</span> pushed back. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries fell to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.0 per cent</span>, about 75 basis points below the yield prevailing when the Fed tightened last March. Bond yields in Germany and Japan also fell. ", " Bond yields across all industrial countries are at low levels at present. The highest yields are in the UK, where economic activity has been very strong and the Bank of England has tightened monetary policy. Even there, however, yields, at 7 per cent, are not high by historical standards. ", " As well as confidence in the inflation outlook, worldwide efforts to impose greater fiscal restraint have encouraged bond yields to fall. For the OECD countries as a group, announced plans for fiscal consolidation would see budget deficits in 1998 of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.7 per cent</span> of GDP, the lowest since the late 1980s, and only about half the average of the early 1990s. Although these planned reductions in deficits are modest – and, in some cases, yet to be delivered – markets have responded positively. ", " Australia has been part of this international trend of fiscal consolidation. The Commonwealth's 1997/98 budget delivered in mid May reaffirmed the Government's commitment to raising national saving by moving the budget to underlying surplus in coming years. Partly reflecting this, <em>Moody's</em> announced that Australia's credit rating would be placed on a ‘positive watch’. ", " By late July, this mix of benevolent influences saw the yield on 10-year bonds returning to about 6.4 per cent, equal to the previous cyclical low of January 1994, and its lowest level for a quarter of a century. While the progressive fall in bond yields over the past couple of years reflects international tail winds and better fiscal settings, fundamentally it has been underpinned by the steady improvement in domestic inflation expectations. The drop brings bond yields in Australia to a position more in line with those in comparable countries, after the disproportionate rise in the bear market of 1994. ", " As a result of the larger fall in short-term interest rates and bond yields in Australia than abroad, both short-term and long-term interest differentials have narrowed <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 8)</span>. They have traditionally favoured Australian dollar investments, but short-term interest rates in Australia are now below those in the United States, <span class=\"no-wrap\">the United Kingdom</span> and New Zealand. ", " The differential between 10-year bond yields in the United States and Australia fell to around 35 basis points, below the spread at the low-point in Australian bond yields in January 1994, and the lowest level since <span class=\"no-wrap\">August 1984</span>. The current slim spread, however, signifies a much healthier state of affairs than the situation of the mid 1980s: in 1984, bond yields both in the United States and Australia were around 13–14 per cent, with <span class=\"no-wrap\">US yields</span> having increased as US inflation expectations deteriorated; the recent experience has seen bond yields in Australia fall toward those in the United States, based on comparably low inflation rates. Differentials between Australia and a number of other countries have also fallen. Since the global peak in bond yields in 1994, the 10-year yield in Australia has fallen by an average of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 percentage</span> points relative to those abroad. ", " The yield curve in Australia for securities with a maturity of less than five years has moved below that segment of the yield curve in the United States <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 29)</span>. For longer maturities, the yield curve in Australia remains slightly higher than in the United States. The short end of the yield curve is heavily influenced by the stance of monetary policy and, accordingly, the relative position of short-term interest rates reflects the cyclical position of the two economies at present, with Australia in a weaker phase than the United States. The long end of the curve is determined by the market's expectations about economic performance and inflation likely to be achieved over the longer haul. The narrow differential between long-term bond yields in Australia and in the United States suggests confidence that Australia will sustain the recent performance on inflation beyond the medium term. The experience of 1994 suggests, however, that such confidence might prove fragile if there were much slippage on the inflation front, or if world bond market conditions in general were to deteriorate. ", " Equity prices continue to set new records in many countries (Graph 30). On Wall St, the Dow Jones index has pushed well above the 8,000 level – with a rise of <span class=\"no-wrap\">28 per cent</span> so far in 1997. The benign outlook for interest rates and confidence in the economic outlook, with expectations of strong corporate earnings, have been the foundation of this strength. European share markets have also been rising strongly, with market indices in London rising by more than 20 per cent and in Frankfurt by 50 per cent so far in 1997. The notable strength in Frankfurt reflects the restructuring that is being undertaken by German companies, reinforced by the depreciation of the mark in recent months, both of which are expected to boost profitability in Germany. After rising strongly in April, the <em>Nikkei Index</em> in Japan had moved by end-July to around the 20,000 level. ", " One factor which has seemed to boost equity markets in recent months, and has also been evident in bond markets, is that investors seem to have re-rated long-term investments to take account of prospective maintenance of low inflation and the prospect of stable economic growth. This climate of stability, as well as providing confidence in the likely persistence of low short-term interest rates, also considerably reduces the risk of marked fluctuations in corporate profitability. The painful process of restructuring businesses, with the aim of raising productivity and cutting costs, has also bolstered optimism about the corporate sector worldwide. ", " After a period in which share prices in Australia had earlier lagged overseas performance, the <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> has generally kept pace with rises abroad in recent months, and has reached new highs. The <em>All Ords</em> rose by around 10 per cent over the three months to end July – an increase below that in the United States but consistent with price movements in other major markets. Prices of resource stocks recently held back the rise in the overall index with some softening in commodity prices generally. The weakness in the resources sector was more widely based than in gold stocks, prices of which have been falling for much of the past year. ", " The exchange rate of the Australian dollar has declined from the peak levels recorded in the March quarter, both in trade-weighted ted terms and, more noticeably, against the strong US dollar <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 31)</span>. This fall mainly reflected the fact that foreign investors began to focus early in the June quarter on the possibility of further cuts in Australian interest rates, which would take them to a level comparable with those in the United States – or perhaps lower if the US continued to tighten policy, as was expected at that time. This saw the Australian dollar move lower both ahead of, and after, the May easing. These pressures continued into June and July as expectations grew of another easing. There was, however, some recovery in late July on good trade data which, among other things, refocussed attention on the possibility of a credit upgrade. This provided a good platform for the July easing of monetary policy, the announcement of which had little impact on the exchange rate, no doubt reflecting the fact that it had been largely anticipated. Overall, the Australian dollar has fallen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> against the US dollar since early May, and about <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> since the peak in March. ", " In trade-weighted terms, the Australian dollar has been a little steadier, with recent levels of the TWI down <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> on early 1997 peaks, but close to its average for much of 1996. This reflects the weakening in the exchange rate of a number of Australia's Asian trading partners (see below). The New Zealand dollar and European currencies have also been softer than the Australian dollar, thereby helping to moderate the fall in the trade-weighted index. In the former case, the weakness reflects some softening in the New Zealand economy and a return of inflation into the target range, both of which have led to expectations of an easing in monetary conditions. In the case of European currencies, the weakness reflects a growing view in markets that European Monetary Union will go ahead, and that the new currency, the Euro, will be ‘softer’ than the German mark has tended to be. European currencies have fallen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 per cent</span> against the US dollar so far in 1997. ", " In the past two months, there have been large falls in the currencies of a number of Asian countries which had been operating systems of pegged or closely managed exchange rates. Similar events have occurred in some emerging countries in Eastern Europe, particularly the Czech Republic and Poland. ", " These problems followed a period of very rapid economic growth in the first half of the 1990s, in many cases financed to a large degree by strong capital inflows from abroad. In some cases, capital inflows were much larger than desirable, as foreigners tried to get in on the ‘Asian growth miracle’. Exchange rates were held broadly steady through this period, and the strong inflows reflected in a rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. For example, among south east Asian countries, reserves rose by about US$180 billion, to US$350 billion, between 1990 and 1997. At the same time, strong growth led to a number of imbalances in some economies, including large current account deficits and overvalued asset prices. ", " The capital flows also led to the development of large foreign currency markets in several of the Asian currencies, particularly in the Thai baht. When sentiment turned negative, the existence of large markets made it possible for speculators to borrow very large sums of the currencies concerned for selling in the spot market. ", " The main focus of market attention has been Thailand. Pressure on the Thai baht first emerged in mid 1996 and again in February 1997. In both episodes, the pressure was met with temporarily increased interest rates. The third wave of capital outflow hit the currency in May, which again prompted higher interest rates, augmented by currency intervention – the Bank of Thailand bought baht in exchange for US dollars – and then imposition of capital controls aimed at preventing further speculative selling of the currency. These measures caused the baht to appreciate by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> in offshore markets between mid May and mid June, as speculators attempted to cover short positions. However, they proved unsustainable when further heavy speculation hit the baht after the Philippines widened the trading band for the peso in early July. The Thai authorities floated the baht on <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 July</span>. By mid July, it had depreciated about <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> from its pre-float levels. It subsequently steadied, assisted by the announcement on 5 August of economic reform measures designed to give Thailand access to an IMF co-ordinated assistance package. ", " Until May, the bouts of pressure on the Thai baht had not been accompanied by pressure on the other Asian currencies. In May, however, there was a quick ‘contagious’ flow-on to the Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah, and a little later to the Philippines peso. These countries have contained these pressures by permitting more flexibility in their currencies over the past month or so. ", " There was also a small fall in the Singapore dollar, although Singapore shared few characteristics with the other economies involved in this. There has also been some modest pressure during July on the Korean won and on the Hong Kong dollar, but net movements in both currencies have been negligible. ", " The precise reasons for this ‘contagion’ are hard to pinpoint. At least in part, however, it seems to reflect the fact that foreign investors are not well-informed of developments in individual countries, and tend to regard ‘emerging markets’ as one homogeneous group; thus, problems in one country quickly lead to selling of investments in all in the group. This would explain why European emerging markets were affected similarly and at the same time. "], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/1997/aug/1.html"},

The pick-up was led mainly by stronger domestic demand, with a cyclical upswing in the housing sector getting under way and a firmer trend in consumer demand. By year's end, the labour market had improved, such that employment and labour force participation were rising, and unemployment was beginning to decline. ", " These developments were helped by the fact that monetary policy had been eased progressively through the second half of 1996, and again in the middle of 1997, a process which brought some interest rates to their lowest levels since the late 1960s. This easing was possible because of the good inflation performance, which in turn was due in almost equal measure to a decline in prices for internationally traded goods and services and a slowing in the pace of growth of domestic costs. Annual underlying inflation ended the year at 1.4 per cent. ", " Early indications are that buoyant growth in private demand is continuing in 1998. The improvement in labour market conditions should mean that household income growth will be adequate to sustain the current trend in consumption, and the housing sector upswing still has some way to run, as does the pick-up in other types of construction. ", " At the same time that this favourable domestic news has been coming through, economic conditions in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian region</span> have continued to deteriorate. Since the Bank's last <em>Semi-Annual Statement</em> in November, Korea became the third country to call for IMF assistance after experiencing financial difficulties in the closing <span class=\"no-wrap\">months of 1997</span>. Asian banking systems have come under pressure from falling currencies and stock markets. Although many Asian economies have steadied since the beginning of 1998, the value of the Indonesian rupiah has halved so that it is now only a quarter of its value in mid 1997. Given Australian exporters' exposure to the region, markets have also pushed down the Australian dollar against the major world currencies. ", " A number of the Asian economies are now entering a period of economic contraction, and considerably higher inflation as a result of the very large currency depreciations. Even in countries where growth will continue, it is likely to be at a significantly reduced pace. Japan, the region's largest economy, has again recorded a stagnant performance over recent months. This is partly because of tax increases last April, but a deeper problem for the Japanese economy is the lingering fragility in the banking system, a problem aggravated by Japan's financial exposures to other Asian markets. ", " In themselves, these developments make the outlook for exporters considerably more difficult, even though export performance over the last year has been quite strong. Exporters will, however, be assisted in many instances by recent developments in the exchange rate, which has depreciated substantially against currencies from outside the region. This should help competitiveness into European and North American markets, which are continuing to grow, and also help Australian exporters to compete with those from countries outside the region in sales into Asia. This should provide some partial offset to the direct impact of the Asian slump. In addition, while commodity prices measured in foreign currency terms have fallen, the decline in the exchange rate has in most cases more than offset this, so that in $A terms, prices have tended to rise over the past year. ", " Overall, some reduction in export growth during 1998 is to be expected, although the full effects might not emerge quickly. These trends will act to slow growth in the Australian economy from the rate it would otherwise have been. On present indications, however, there is enough momentum in domestic demand to achieve a reasonable pace of overall growth. The divergence between domestic demand and external circumstances means that the current account deficit will widen further. ", " Monetary policy remains conducive to domestic expansion: interest rates are relatively low, and credit is growing strongly. The exchange rate has fluctuated considerably in bilateral terms and will have diverse effects on different parts of the economy. At current levels, the import-weighted exchange rate is close to its average level of the past year and will have little net impact on the trend in import prices, but the downward impetus to import prices working over the past year has been removed. The Bank's current expectation is that underlying inflation will gradually move up towards the target over the year ahead. ", " Monetary policy will be directed towards the continuance of the low-inflation expansion that the economy has experienced since the early 1990s. In this, it will be assisted by the fact that the economy is entering what could be a difficult year in good shape, with output growing at 4 per cent plus and low inflation. In the period ahead, the pursuit of these medium-term objectives will require policy to place a good deal of importance on fostering financial market stability. Australia has done well to avoid the worst of the financial turmoil that has characterised our region over the past 12 months – continuing to do so must be a high priority. ", " The turmoil in East Asian financial markets intensified in the closing months of 1997 and into early 1998, with periods of extreme instability in several countries. The escalation of the disturbance was first evident in its spread from the ASEAN economies to South Korea, the region's second largest economy, and then by renewed pressure on Indonesia in January. In a number of countries, but particularly in Indonesia, exchange rates have now fallen to levels that seem impossible to justify on economic criteria. Developments in Japan added to the gloom across the Asian region, as further failures in the Japanese financial system came to light and the economy continued to disappoint. ", " The turmoil in Asia also had a significant impact on markets in developed countries. The US dollar appreciated, bond yields in the US and elsewhere generally fell and share markets fell sharply in October before gradually recovering over the following months. These developments reflected ‘safe-haven’ buying of US dollars and bonds, and talk, to an extent exaggerated, of possible deflationary influences beginning to operate in goods markets as a result of developments in Asia. Commodity prices, including prices for gold, oil and base metals, fell quite sharply in some cases when measured in US dollars, although less so when measured in other currencies. ", " In the case of Australia, bond yields and share prices have broadly moved in line with those in the US – i.e. bond yields have fallen and the share market has moved higher, hesitantly, after the drop in October. In the case of the exchange rate, pessimism about commodity prices and the potential consequences of reduced trade with Asia saw the Australian dollar move lower against the US dollar. Needless to say, it was stronger against the currencies of major trading partners in Asia. As discussed in the article <em>Alternative Measures of the Effects of Exchange Rate                          Movements on Competitiveness</em>, published in the January <cite>Bulletin</cite>, these divergent trends should be interpreted carefully. ", " After the sharp falls in the September quarter, it looked for a time in October that the exchange rates of the ASEAN-4 (Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia) had begun to steady. IMF support programs for Thailand – which had already been put in place – and for Indonesia, which was well advanced, helped calm investors in these markets. ", " As was reported in the Bank's November <cite>Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, however, this turned out to be a false dawn. The disturbance entered a new, and ultimately more serious, phase later in October when Taiwan devalued its currency in an effort to recoup losses in its competitiveness from the large depreciations of the currencies of the ASEAN-4. In reaction to this, pressures built on other countries of North Asia which had been holding the line on their exchange rates. A particular market focus was the viability of the peg of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Hong Kong</span> dollar to the US dollar. Authorities in Hong Kong responded successfully to this test with a combination of strong foreign exchange intervention and large rises in interest rates. ", " A similar line of defence in South Korea failed to contain exchange rate pressures. The country was more susceptible to an adverse financial shock because economic growth had slowed and Korean companies and banks had built up high levels of foreign debt, much of it short term. As the exchange rate and share prices fell, these weaknesses were exposed. Many Korean companies and banks found it increasingly difficult to raise sufficient foreign exchange to repay foreign-currency debt as it fell due, with the resulting uncertainty accentuating pressure on the exchange rate. By early December, foreign exchange reserves had been heavily depleted and the Korean authorities sought assistance from the IMF. ", " While this provided some temporary relief to exchange pressures, the approach of presidential elections, and a lengthy handover period to the new administration, delayed decisive policy action, including settlement of conditions with the IMF. This meant that, although the IMF-led support package was the largest in <span class=\"no-wrap\">history                          (US$59 billion, of which Australia will contribute US$1 billion)</span>, the won fell heavily again for a time. Some stability was achieved after it was announced that private banks in many countries were rolling over maturing obligations of South Korean banks, and that donor countries participating in the IMF package would accelerate their bilateral assistance. By late January, the won had settled around a level 40 per cent lower than in July 1997. ", " While the Korean exchange rate began to settle in January, the Indonesian currency fell sharply as doubts grew about that country's capacity to comply with the terms of its IMF package. Political circumstances including reports of the President's ill health were partly responsible, as was suspicion that the Indonesian budget did not comply with IMF guidelines. At one stage, the rupiah fell to an intra-day low of almost 17,000 to the US dollar, compared with about 2500 in mid 1997. It has since recovered somewhat, but remains down by around 75 per cent. This experience was well beyond that of other currencies in the region. Over the same period, the exchange rates of Thailand and Malaysia fell by around 45 per cent, the Philippines' peso was down by 36 per cent and the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Taiwan and Singapore</span> dollars by about 17 per cent (Graphs 1 and 2). The currencies of China and Hong Kong have remained steady throughout the episode. ", " All stock markets in Asia declined significantly in the second half of 1997. Falls of 40–50 per cent are common around the region, and are larger, of course, in US dollar terms. More recently, some of the markets have recovered somewhat. Movements in Asian share markets are summarised in Table 1. ", " Efforts to stabilise exchange rates around Asia have involved higher short-term interest rates (Graph 3). In the three countries receiving support from the IMF, short-term interest rates have increased by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 percentage points</span> from their levels in the first half of 1997. While the higher structure of short-term interest rates across Asia should eventually help stabilise capital flows and relevant exchange rates, they are also likely to restrain growth in domestic spending and possibly add to deflationary pressures in asset markets in the countries concerned. ", " The deterioration in the Japanese economy and the evident strains in the financial system saw confidence fall to a low ebb in financial markets there. The most pronounced adjustment was in the stock market, where the Nikkei index fell to under 15,000 in December, a level last seen in the recession of 1995. Announcement of a fiscal package designed to stimulate the economy initially failed to revive the stock market, where sentiment continued to mirror concern about the stability of the financial system. Subsequently, however, rumours that the authorities may undertake further measures helped the market to recover to about 17,000 by late January. This was, nonetheless, still almost 20 per cent down from mid 1997. ", " With weakness on the stock exchange, and perceptions that Japan might be moving toward a phase of deflation, demand for Japanese bonds remained strong. The yield on 10-year bonds rallied from the already low level of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.5 per cent</span> in June 1997, to new historical lows of about 1.6 per cent by November, before settling around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.8 per cent</span>. ", " The stance of Japanese monetary policy has remained unchanged in recent months, with the call money rate around 0.5 per cent. Despite this, there has been some rise in Japanese banks' cost of funds, reflecting a widening in risk premia. At the short end of the yield curve, yields on three-month euro-yen securities rose by about 50 basis points, to 1 per cent. The premium on foreign currency raisings by Japanese banks increased even further. ", " Weakness in Asia had its counterpoint in strengthening US markets: the US dollar rose against all major currencies and US bond yields moved to new lows. Underpinning the strength of the US bond market is the continuing run of improving inflation news – both producer and consumer prices – and growing confidence that this would continue without the Fed having to act to slow the US economy. The inflation-restraining influence of Asian developments, especially in goods markets, gave the rally in bonds further support, with the yield on 10-year <span class=\"no-wrap\">US Treasuries</span> falling to an intra-day low of 5.3 per cent, their lowest level since 1993. Bond yields also rallied in other major industrial countries. In Germany, for example, yields also moved to a new cyclical low of 5.0 per cent. ", " The rise in the US dollar in recent months is a continuation of a trend that began in mid 1995. Since then, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> has appreciated in trade-weighted terms by about 20 per cent (Graph 4). This appreciation reflects the health of the US economy relative to that of other major countries, reinforced in recent months by strong <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘safe-haven’</span> buying following the turbulence in Asia. ", " The rise in the US dollar is consistent with desirable adjustments in the world economy at this stage, since it will help spill strong growth in domestic demand in the United States over to economies with excess productive capacity, especially in Asia, including Japan. In the process, it will also help limit inflationary pressures in <span class=\"no-wrap\">the United States</span>, thereby possibly delaying any need to tighten monetary policy. After the tightening in <span class=\"no-wrap\">March 1997</span>, which lifted the Fed funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to 5.5 per cent, the Fed has left interest rates unchanged. This was against a background of continuing good inflation outcomes, notwithstanding the strength of demand and the tightening of the labour market. However, interest rates have been increased in the UK, several other European countries, Canada and New Zealand in recent months. In the case of the latter two countries, some of the rise was in response to softness in exchange rates <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 5)</span>. ", " The Australian dollar has moved lower against the US dollar. In early January, it reached a low of US63.20 cents before intervention by the Bank lifted the rate above US64 cents. Thereafter, more settled conditions in Asia, a recovery in the price of gold and comments by some investment banks to the effect that the local currency had been significantly undervalued against the US dollar also boosted sentiment. By early February, the Australian dollar had risen to around US68 cents (Graph 6). ", " Over the past year or so, the Australian dollar has depreciated by about 15 per cent against the US dollar. At the same time, it has appreciated very strongly against the currencies of a number of major trading partners in Asia. The net result of weakness against the US dollar and strength against currencies of trading partners in Asia was that the trade-weighted index of the Australian dollar has increased in recent months to as high as 62, a level slightly above that reached in early 1997. ", " As was explained in the article <em>Alternative Measures of the Effects of Exchange Rate                                    Movements on Competitiveness</em>, published in the January <cite>Bulletin</cite>, the contrasting influences on the Australian dollar, resulting from the strong US dollar and weak Asian currencies, mean that the trade-weighted index is currently providing a somewhat misleading picture of overall exchange rate developments. The Bank's view is that this combination of movements in bilateral rates, for an unchanged TWI, would tend to have a moderately expansionary net effect on prices and economic activity in Australia, although the effects are not evenly distributed through the economy. ", " A number of factors have contributed to the decline in the Australian dollar against the US dollar. As discussed, with the US dollar rising against all currencies, some depreciation of the Australian dollar in US dollar terms was inevitable and desirable. Additionally, financial markets were aware that the deterioration in Asia will make the trading climate more difficult for Australian exporters, with some increase in Australia's current account deficit likely. A related concern is that excess capacity in Asian economies might contribute to deflationary forces, at least in some goods markets. These influences on the Australian dollar occurred against a backdrop of relatively low domestic interest rates and narrow interest differentials against other countries. ", " In recent months, the Bank has undertaken some modest intervention in the foreign exchange market at times when markets were unsettled, or when the fall in the exchange rate risked becoming self-reinforcing. In doing so, it has not sought to prevent a sensible adjustment in the exchange rate to reflect the deterioration in Australia's international trading climate. This intervention was the first such exercise since November 1993. Since October, Reserve Bank purchases of Australian dollars have amounted to $400 million, of which $100 million was undertaken in January. ", " With no change in monetary policy in recent months, the main influence on short-term interest rates in Australia was the run of economic news, which pointed to healthy economic growth. Expectations of a further cut in the cash rate were dispelled by mid November. Short-term interest rates rose as a result, with the yield on 90-day bank bills rising by 0.25 of a percentage point to around 5 per cent, the level of the cash rate (Graph 7). ", " As expectations of a further cut in the cash rate subsided, bond yields also rose for a period. Between late November and early December, they moved up by 0.5 of a percentage point to near 6.4 per cent. As bond yields in the United States then rallied, however, the yield on 10-year bonds in Australia also fell, and by early January had reached around 5.6 per cent, its lowest level since May 1969 (Graph 8). In those days, low interest rates were set by the authorities and the demand for bonds by financial institutions was artificially boosted by ‘captive’ arrangements which forced them to maintain a set ratio of bonds to total assets. The major factor in recent moves in Australia, as abroad, was a consensus that events in Asia would probably have a disinflationary effect. The spread to the yields in the United States also moved up from the historical low, of virtually zero early in November, to around 40 points at present (Graph 9). ", " In the wake of the recent financial instability most expectations are that growth in the East Asian region will decline significantly over the next year or two, with contractions in some countries. Thailand, Indonesia and Korea are likely to be in this latter group – showing a sharp contrast to the growth rates of 6 to 8 per cent that had been typical earlier in the decade. Elsewhere in the region, the effects on growth are generally expected to be smaller, although still sizeable. ", " There are several forces at work contributing to the weaker growth outlook. Part of the background to the financial instability described earlier was an extended period of strong credit growth which supported inflated asset prices, excessive investment in property development and surplus industrial capacity in a number of industries. With this cycle now having turned down, economies are experiencing a period of adjustment in which surplus capacity has to be absorbed and debt burdens reduced to more manageable levels. The experience of other countries, including developed economies, which have undergone this sort of financial adjustment in the past, has been that the process can take some time to work through, and involves a sharp contraction in economic activity and declining asset prices. The adjustment problem is compounded by difficulties in financial institutions and by continuing high interest rates in some countries, aimed at resisting further downward pressures on exchange rates. ", " These forces operating to restrain domestic demand will to some extent be offset by the boost to exports coming from exchange rate depreciations. By any standard, the depreciations that have taken place in the currencies of the ASEAN-4 economies and Korea will make their exports highly competitive on world markets, and should help export-oriented businesses to rebuild their profit margins. On the other hand, there has been little change in competitiveness for Singapore and Taiwan, while China and Hong Kong have lost competitiveness <em lang=\"fr\">vis-a-vis</em> other countries in the region. To some extent, also, the gains in competitiveness of the countries with depreciating currencies will be offset over time by the higher inflation which is already becoming evident. ", " It will be some time before confident judgments can be made about the overall impact of these forces, partly because the financial market developments are still unfolding. Nonetheless, indicators becoming available in the past few months have shown the beginnings of the effects of the financial instability on trade and economic activity in the region (Table 2). The effects are clearest in the case of Thailand, where the level of industrial production began to fall in mid 1997 after a period of growth averaging around 10 per cent over the previous two years; by November, Thai industrial production was 15 per cent below the level of a year earlier. Following the currency depreciation, the Thai trade account has moved into surplus, largely through a sharp decline in imports. Exports in US dollar terms have been relatively flat, but this probably implies some growth in volume terms, as baht depreciation allows Thai producers to lower their US dollar selling prices. ", " Elsewhere in the region there are also signs of weaker import demand in some countries, particularly in Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, where imports have been declining in US dollar terms for several months. Industrial production has so far continued to grow solidly in most countries, possibly reflecting the resilience of exports. ", " The Japanese economy continues to struggle, with confidence having been set back by the developments elsewhere in Asia. Following the 2.8 per cent fall in the June quarter, output had been expected to rebound solidly in the September quarter. In the event, it expanded by only 0.8 per cent in the quarter, to be up <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.0 per cent</span> over the year. More recent indicators continue to suggest a weaker-than-expected recovery, which has led to a sharp downgrading in forecasts of output growth in 1998. Consumer confidence is low, the unemployment rate remains around its record high of 3.5 per cent, and banks are imposing tougher credit constraints on borrowers. External demand had been providing some stimulus to the domestic economy on the back of a significant depreciation of the yen since 1995; the prospects of it continuing to do so have been dimmed by the mounting economic problems in the rest of Asia, which is Japan's largest export market. ", " The latest <em>Tankan</em> survey confirms businesses' pessimism about the economy's near-term prospects. Financial fragility continues to hamper the recovery; official estimates of bad and doubtful loans held by Japanese banks are now estimated to have reached 12 per cent of total loans. A number of fiscal stimulus packages have been announced in recent months, including a one-off <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>2 trillion (0.4 per cent of GDP) personal income tax cut. The government has also approved the use of public funds to stabilise the financial system, with <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>17 trillion being allocated for protection of deposits and <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>13 trillion for the purchase of the shares and debt of troubled banks. ", " Despite a natural tendency to concentrate on Asia, developments in the United States and Europe remain important to an overall assessment of Australia's external environment. The United States and <span class=\"no-wrap\">European economies</span> together make up a larger part of world demand than Asia does, and they have the dominant bearing on the outlook for commodity prices. In addition, history has shown that economic activity in the United States has generally had an influence on the Australian business cycle out of proportion to the direct trade links between the two countries. The continuing health of the United States and European economies should therefore help to mitigate, to some extent, the effects on Australia of the economic problems in Asia. ", " The <em>United States</em> economy continues to enjoy a remarkable conjunction of strong growth and low inflation. During 1997, the seventh year of economic expansion, output grew by 3.9 per cent. This added 3.2 million jobs to payrolls, bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.7 per cent, below most estimates of the rate consistent with steady inflation. Despite this, earnings growth has picked up only modestly, with average hourly earnings rising by 3.7 per cent, and the employment cost index, a broader measure of labour costs, up by 3.3 per cent over the year. Core producer prices were essentially unchanged over the year and the exchange rate appreciated, which, together with refinements to the measurement of consumer prices, helped to deliver a rise of only <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.2 per cent</span> in core consumer prices over 1997. The continuation of strong growth combined with minimal inflation pressures has led gradually to an upgrading of output growth forecasts for 1998. ", " Stronger growth in the major continental <em>European</em> economies is reducing the difference in performance between them and a periphery of faster-growing economies. In Germany, a gradual recovery is continuing, although net foreign trade continues to provide a disproportionate share of this growth. In France and Italy, there are clearer signs of strengthening domestic demand. Price pressures remain muted in all three economies, but economic growth is not yet sufficiently robust to make significant inroads into the record levels of unemployment. After estimated growth of 2.5 per cent in 1997, forecasters had been becoming more optimistic about Western European growth in 1998. Although recent events in Asia have led to a minor scaling back of these forecasts, a modest pick-up in growth is still expected this year. ", " Real output is likely to have expanded by around 4 per cent, or possibly a little faster, through 1997, compared with growth of 2.4 per cent through 1996. This strengthening owes a good deal to a marked pick-up in private consumption, usually a component of demand that displays little variability in growth. The dwelling sector continues to contribute to growth, driven by historically high levels of housing affordability, although the upturn is more moderate than usual because of lingering pockets of over-supply, arising from the previous cycle. Business investment remains a major driver of the expansion, with the recent strength being contributed by equipment investment, rather than spending on buildings and structures. The quantity of exports has displayed good growth through 1997, while strong growth in imports over the same period confirms the strength of domestic demand. ", " The strengthening in domestic activity through 1997 brought forth a solid lift in employment in the second half of the year, with most of the strength in full-time employment. With the rise in the demand for labour, unemployment has begun to fall, and people are being encouraged back into the labour force. ", " The national accounts measure of private consumption grew strongly in the June and September quarters, following an extended period of sluggishness. The earlier weakness was concentrated in retail trade, which makes up 40 per cent of private consumption. Sales at department stores and clothing retailers were particularly weak in the first half of 1997 as consumers postponed discretionary spending. By contrast, other components of consumption maintained good, steady growth, as most of them have since the beginning of the 1990s. The strengthening in retail trade, which began in mid year, was led by a resurgence in spending at department stores, but has otherwise been reasonably broadly based. Motor vehicle sales have been particularly strong, rising by around 20 per cent over the past year. Monthly retail sales and motor vehicle sales data suggest that consumption remained at a high level in the December quarter. While retail sales data recorded a decline in the month of December, an increasing tendency for spending to be delayed until January over recent years has meant that December data usually need to be taken with results for January in order to gauge the strength of demand. ", " The strengthening of private consumption has been supported by steady growth in household incomes, and by declines in interest rates, which have benefited the nearly 30 per cent of households with home loans. Spending by consumers may also have been encouraged by improved employment prospects in the second half of the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 10)</span>. ", " Consumer sentiment, as measured by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey, remains clearly above its longer-term average, but has changed little over the past year. Over the last few months, consumers' expectations of their own economic prospects for the year ahead have improved gradually, while their assessment of the outlook for the economy has deteriorated. This may suggest that, while aware of the emergence of serious economic problems in Asia, consumers have been more influenced by strengthening domestic economic conditions when assessing their own prospects. ", " The reduction in home-loan interest rates – due both to declines in official interest rates and a narrowing of margins in the home-loan market as competition intensified – has driven housing affordability to its current extremely high level, and has underpinned the gradual expansion in dwelling investment. That this pick-up has not been stronger is due to the higher-than-usual excess supply of dwellings in the outer suburbs of most capital cities and in regional Australia. ", " Consistent with the gradual winding back of this excess supply and with the high levels of affordability, lending for housing resumed its upward trend in the second half of 1997 after pausing earlier in the year (Graph 11). Over the three months to November 1997, the value of new loans approved was 30 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Although the monthly data display considerable volatility, lending for both existing dwellings and new construction continue to rise in trend terms. Building approvals went through a soft patch in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">middle of 1997</span>, but the latest data are consistent with the solid growth in housing loans, suggesting that the housing sector retains sufficient momentum for continued steady growth in 1998. House prices rose quite strongly during 1997 in Sydney and Melbourne, while in other capital cities the picture has been mixed. ", " Recent surveys of business sentiment suggest an improvement in trading conditions since the first half of 1997, which is consistent with the pick-up in consumer spending and the gradual impact of the trend towards lower interest rates from the middle of 1996. This is apparent across a range of surveys, including the National Australia Bank survey of firms across the whole non-farm economy, the Yellow Pages survey of small businesses, the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturing and the Dun and Bradstreet survey of manufacturing, retailing and wholesaling (Graph 12). ", " Although trading conditions are reported to be improving, firms continue to operate in a competitive environment in which they have only limited capacity to raise selling prices. This is shown by low rates of increase in output prices and subdued corporate profit growth. Adjusting for privatisations, profits in the private corporate sector as a ratio to GDP have been around their longer-term averages for the past few years with, if anything, a slight tendency to decline. In the September quarter of 1997, corporate profits amounted to 14.3 per cent of GDP, about ½ a percentage point below the decade average. ", " While indicators of current domestic conditions remain strong, there has been a recent tendency for businesses to note a weakening in export sales and to expect a weakening in future conditions. This seems to reflect concern about the impact of the Asian financial problems: surveys that have questioned Australian firms about the likely impact of Asian instability on trading conditions have reported an increase in concern in the December quarter. ", " Private business investment remains strong. Over the year to the September quarter 1997, business fixed investment grew by 15 per cent, its fifth year of double-digit growth. The strong performance over the past year was entirely accounted for by growth in equipment investment; by contrast, investment in building and structures declined slightly. The latest ABS Capital Expenditure Survey suggests further strong growth in equipment investment in the 1997–98 financial year, with the fourth estimate of investment intentions for 1997–98 showing a significant upgrading compared with the previous three estimates (Graph 13). ", " Forward indicators of investment in buildings and structures are more mixed. The Capital Expenditure Survey suggests that there will be little, if any, growth in this component of investment in 1997–98, while other indicators suggest a stronger outlook. The stock of work yet to be done on non-residential buildings in the ABS Survey of Building Activity has been rising solidly over recent years (Graph 14). Furthermore, the pick-up in non-residential building approvals in the second half of 1997 is indicative of a strengthening in activity in this sector over coming quarters. In the engineering construction sector, a large stock of work yet to be done has been built up recently, concentrated mainly in private-sector infrastructure (mainly road building) and mining projects. Together, these other indicators suggest that buildings and structures investment may not be as weak as suggested by the Capital Expenditure Survey. ", " In terms of the sectoral pattern of investment, most of the expected growth in investment in 1997–98 is in the mining industry. If the latest survey expectations are realised (and the fourth estimate usually gives quite a good guide to actual investment) investment expenditure in the mining industry this financial year will exceed that in the manufacturing industry for the first year since these data became available in 1963. This is partly a consequence of the subdued nature of the manufacturing sector, with squeezed profitability and weak output growth over the past few years. Expected growth in mining investment is nevertheless very strong: if expectations are realised, investment expenditure in mining this financial year will be almost twice that of three years ago. ", " Investment expectations are, however, subject to the unavoidable uncertainties arising from the economic problems in Asia. The latest estimates of investment are based on a survey of firms conducted in October and early November 1997, when the economic problems of South-East Asia were apparent, but those of North Asia were less so. It remains to be seen whether some investment projects are postponed on account of these problems. ", " For the mining sector, there is evidence that confidence about the future is waning, which might in time be expected to reduce future investment. A comparison of the latest quarterly NAB survey (conducted in late November and early December 1997) with the one conducted three months earlier, reveals that mining firms have sharply downgraded their expectations of business conditions over the next 12 months (in contrast to firms in other sectors which report only a minor downgrading). This also seems consistent with the stockmarket's valuation of mining companies, with the All Resources Index falling by one-quarter over the second half of 1997, compared with a fall of less than 5 per cent in the All Ordinaries Index over this time. ", " No doubt part of this weakness reflects the decline in global commodity prices over recent months and the fact that many Australian mining companies are global in their operations. So far as mining activity in Australia is concerned, however, the fact that the prices of commodities measured in Australian dollars have tended to rise as the Australian dollar has depreciated against major currencies (see below), should help to support longer-term profitability and confidence in the mining sector. ", " Commodity prices have declined in recent months, with developments in Asia expected to contribute to some weakening in world demand for commodities in 1998 (Graph 15). The Bank's commodity price index in SDRs has declined by 6 per cent since September 1997, bringing it back to the levels of late 1995. However, the depreciation of the $A against the major world currencies has meant that Australian dollar prices received by domestic commodity producers rose through most of 1997. ", " Base metal prices in US dollars have fallen by almost 20 per cent in the past six months, undoing almost all of their rise over the previous year. They are now moderately below their average of the 1990s, with continued good demand from Europe and the US offsetting, to some extent, the worsening prospects in Asia. This has also been a factor in the 3 per cent rise in $US contract prices negotiated for iron ore exports in 1998, despite an expected slowing in steel production throughout Asia and the strength of the US dollar against most of the world's currencies. ", " This worldwide strength of the US dollar goes some way to explaining the fall in the US dollar prices of other key commodities. The US dollar contract prices of Australia's coal exports will be reduced in 1998, with falls of between 5 and 10 per cent beginning in April. However, since <span class=\"no-wrap\">January 1997</span> (when these contracts were last negotiated), the US dollar has appreciated by 13 per cent against the Australian dollar, meaning that coal contract prices have risen in Australian dollar terms over this time. Gold prices have been declining in US dollar terms, but are little changed in Australian dollars since the middle of 1997. Crude oil prices have been weaker, falling by around 20 per cent in US dollars since October. ", " There have also been noticeable falls in rural prices. Wheat prices in US dollars have continued to ease, with world production boosted by large harvests in Europe and the US, although again, measured in Australian dollars, they have been largely unchanged since the beginning of 1997. Since November, the price of wool has fallen by more than 10 per cent in $A terms, despite the currency depreciation, as demand from Asia is expected to weaken in 1998. ", " After being in surplus for most of 1997, the balance of trade in goods and services moved into deficit at the end of the year. This mainly reflected a 12 per cent increase in imports in December. The volume of exports grew strongly over the year, boosted by strength in resource exports, especially metals (Graph 16). Despite some quarterly volatility, the volume of manufactured exports also increased, rising by around 10 per cent over the year to December. By contrast, rural exports have begun to weaken, no doubt reflecting the drop in farm output in 1997–98 following last year's record harvests. ", " There have been tentative signs of a weakening of Australian exports to East Asia in recent months, although it is too early yet for these to have become widespread. In broad terms, exports to East Asia were flat during 1996, but began to recover quite strongly in the early part of 1997, following the pattern of East Asia's aggregate international trade. The latest monthly data, although volatile, suggest that the stronger growth in exports to the region continued for most of 1997, but that exports in some areas, particularly to the ASEAN-4 countries, declined at the end of the year (Graph 17). There have also been some substantial declines in tourist arrivals from a number of countries in the region (Graph 18). ", " A weaker export performance has been most clearly evident in the case of Thailand, which was the first of the East Asian economies to turn down. Australia's merchandise exports to Thailand have been declining for much of the past two years. More recently, there has been a significant weakening in merchandise export sales to Indonesia. Visitor arrivals from both Thailand and Indonesia have also fallen sharply since mid 1997. In December, arrivals from Thailand were nearly 40 per cent below their level of a year earlier, and those from Indonesia over <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 per cent lower</span>. ", " Exports to Japan have so far been resilient in the face of weaker Japanese growth, although the strength of exports in Australian dollar terms may partly reflect valuation effects. Visitor arrivals from Japan have fallen by over 10 per cent over the year to December. Total exports to Korea have declined by close to 20 per cent over the past year, but this picture is significantly affected by exports of gold. Gold had been a major area of growth in exports to Korea in recent years (rising to 40 per cent of the total in 1996), with much of the gold apparently being imported by Korea for re-export. This activity has recently contracted. Gold, however, is a commodity for which alternative markets can be found at prevailing world prices, and the decline in gold exports to Korea since mid 1997 has been matched by a rise in gold exports to Hong Kong and Singapore. Excluding gold, Australia's merchandise exports to Korea have been flat in Australian dollar terms over the past year. Visitor arrivals from Korea, however, fell sharply in December to be over 60 per cent lower than a year earlier. ", " Buoyant domestic demand in Australia continues to drive strong growth in imports. The quantity of imports is estimated to have risen by about 3 per cent in the December quarter, mostly accounted for by a strong rise in the month of December. Growth was concentrated in capital goods and intermediate products. A pause in consumer imports followed exceptionally strong growth (around 15 per cent) over the previous two quarters. ", " The current account deficit has remained close to 4 per cent of GDP over the past couple of years, with rising terms of trade offsetting the effect of faster growth in the quantity of imports. Over the course of 1998, however, the combined impact of the recent decline in the world price of commodities, slower trading partner growth acting to restrain export volumes, and continued strong domestic demand is likely to lead to a noticeable widening in the current account deficit. ", " Australian net foreign debt, at 42 per cent of GDP in the September quarter of 1997 (the latest available data), was roughly the same as it has been over the past few years. This relative stability has been a consequence of both the longer-term improvement in the trade account and the shift towards equity financing of the current account over this time. Approximately 40 per cent of the foreign debt is denominated in Australian dollars, providing some insulation from the effects of exchange rate movements. ", " Employment picked up strongly in the second half of 1997, after a period of lacklustre growth (Graph 19). Total employment grew at an annual rate of almost 3 per cent in the second half of 1997. Full-time employment rose faster, at an annual rate of 3½ per cent, after recording no net growth over the previous 18 months (Graph 20). ", " An alternative way of calculating employment growth (based on a matched sample of the roughly seven-eighths of people common to the survey in successive months) suggests that the extent of both the earlier weakness and the subsequent strength of the pick-up may have been exaggerated by the published estimates. (Further details on calculation of the matched-sample estimates are provided in the November 1997 <cite><a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1997/nov/2.html\">Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</a>.)</cite> Taking the two series together, however, gives a clear indication of a firming in the labour market in the second half of 1997. ", " This assessment is supported by the recent behaviour of the participation rate (the proportion of the working age population that is either employed or actively looking for work). This had declined gradually from mid 1995 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1997</span>, in line with the sluggish growth of employment. The decline in the rate was particularly sharp for 15–24 year olds, which is consistent with a faster-than-usual rise in the proportion of this age group undertaking education over this time. In the second half of 1997, however, as employment strengthened, the participation rate turned up as people were encouraged back into the labour force. In addition, the unemployment rate began to decline. It reached 8.1 per cent in December and averaged 8.3 per cent in the December quarter, after averaging 8.7 per cent in each of the preceding three quarters. ", " These trends are mainly a result of the pick-up in growth in the economy observed over the past several quarters. Consistent with this, the observed strengthening in employment has been concentrated in wholesale and retail trade and construction – industries that are generally thought to be sensitive to the state of the business cycle. Over the three months to November, these cyclically sensitive industries generated net jobs growth of 114,200. Agriculture, and to a lesser extent mining, also contributed to employment growth. By contrast, employment in manufacturing remains stagnant, consistent with subdued profits and modest output growth, as well as strong real wage growth in significant parts of the industry. ", " Most forward-looking indicators suggest that the demand for labour will continue to strengthen in the months ahead. According to the ABS data, the number of private-sector job vacancies increased by 6.8 per cent over the year to November 1997, continuing the modest upward trend evident over the past two years. The ANZ measure of job vacancies declined in January 1998, but remains 13 per cent higher than a year earlier. Business surveys of hiring intentions present a more subdued outlook, particularly for manufacturing firms, the majority of which say that they intend to continue shedding labour. ", " The pace of financial intermediation in the economy appears to have picked up as domestic economic activity has accelerated. The stock of credit outstanding from financial intermediaries to the non-finance sector grew at an annual rate of 13.1 per cent over the six months to December 1997, with much of the pick-up occurring in the last three months of the year. This represents a rapid pace of growth in an economy in which nominal output is likely to have grown at an annual rate of something like 5 per cent over the same period. The pick-up in credit growth occurred in both the personal and business sectors (Graph 21). ", " On the other side of intermediaries' balance sheets, growth in broad money eased towards the end of 1997, after running at double-digit annual rates earlier in the year. Consistent with the reduced opportunity cost of holding transaction accounts and cash in an environment of low inflation and low market interest rates, M1 remains the fastest-growing monetary aggregate, although the growth rates seen in recent months have also fallen well below those in the first half of 1997. This suggests that the portfolio adjustment to the low interest rate environment may have largely run its course. Currency growth also slowed a little towards the end of last year. Nevertheless, it remained stronger in 1997 than at any time since the early 1990s; currency grew by 7.5 per cent over the year to December, more than double its rate of growth a year ago. In the last few months of 1997, it is likely that the Telstra float and the purchase of the second instalment of the third tranche of Commonwealth Bank shares have led to a modest boost to credit and a modest slowing of monetary growth, as people borrowed and drew down deposits to pay for shares, with the proceeds flowing out of the private financial sector to the Commonwealth. ", " The easing of financial conditions, as measured by the cost and availability of credit, has been more pronounced for household borrowers than for other sectors over the past 18 months. This is because of the increased competition between established providers and new entrants into the home-loan market, which has, to date, seen standard variable home-loan rates fall by more than other interest rates. As a consequence, home-loan rates in real terms are now well below their previous lows registered in 1993–94, when the economy was still emerging tentatively from the downturn of the early 1990s. ", " The fall in home-loan interest rates represents a boost to the disposable incomes of many of the nearly <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span> of households with home loans. One response to this rise in incomes has been the renewed strength of private consumption during 1997. But many households have also taken the opportunity presented by the fall in home-loan interest rates to increase the equity in their homes, by maintaining monthly repayments at their old level and hence reducing the principal more quickly than required under the original terms of their loans. This is likely to explain the moderate growth in housing credit since mid 1997, despite very high levels of new housing loan approvals. ", " Coincident with the strength in private consumption, personal credit growth picked up significantly in the second half of 1997. Part of the strength, particularly in October and November, appears to reflect greater use of credit by small investors participating in the Telstra share float. Overall, commitments for new personal lending have been rising sharply, and this has been reflected in consumption and personal credit outstanding. Rapid growth in personal credit in December reflects strength in the revolving components of personal credit, particularly bank overdrafts, which increased strongly in the last three months of 1997 and remains the fastest growing component of personal credit. ", " The business sector remains well-placed to fund investment despite some softness in profits and retained earnings. Business credit has picked up noticeably in recent months, with annualised growth of 15.3 per cent in the six months to December 1997, compared with 8.8 per cent in the previous six months, although part of this acceleration reflects new loans to finance the purchase of recently privatised businesses. Funding from raisings of new equity has also increased of late. Taking these two funding sources together with retained earnings, total business funding (adjusted for privatisations) has risen through 1997 to 15.2 per cent of GDP in the September quarter, above its decade average of 13½ per cent. ", " On 1 January 1998, the AMP Society was demutualised with the issue of shares to its 1.8 million policyholders. The new controlling company, AMP Limited, is scheduled to be listed on the stock exchange around the middle of the year, with estimates of market capitalisation in the region of $9½-11 billion. Shares were allocated to policyholders on the basis of the size of their policies, the extent of their participation and the length of time for which they had been held. The demutualisation gives current policyholders (who are now shareholders) a readily transferable share of the wealth that has accumulated in the AMP Society since itsn inception. In that sense, the demutualisation may be seen as a windfall gain by current policyholders/shareholders. Experience with demutualisations in other countries, mainly the UK, suggests that some shareholders are likely to respond by increasing their expenditure, providing a boost to aggregate demand during 1998. ", " There has been no movement for some time in the indicator rates on variable-rate housing loans or on loans to small and large businesses. Housing rates remain at 6.7 per cent from banks and 6.4 per cent from mortgage managers, while indicator rates for variable-rate loans are 8.8 per cent for small businesses and 8.5 per cent for large businesses. In the case of business loans, these are the lowest rates since 1973; in the case of housing loans the rate is lower than at any time since 1970 (Graph 22). ", " Despite the steadiness in standard indicator rates, the average interest rate paid by small businesses is continuing to decline, partly because banks have become more innovative in the loan products offered to this group. Each quarter, the Bank collects information on the total cost of loans to businesses. In the latest collection, for the September quarter 1997, the interest cost of <em>variable-rate</em> borrowing by small business fell by 1.0 percentage point to 9.6 per cent. This brought the total fall since mid 1996 to 3.0 percentage points, less than the <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.8 percentage point</span> fall in the standard variable home-loan rate, but 0.5 of a percentage point more than the cut in the cash rate over this period. This suggests that competitive forces have now spread more widely, from the market for housing loans into the provision of small business financing. This is partly because reduced margins on housing lending have forced banks to look to increase market share in other sectors. Consequently, banks have introduced a number of new lending products for small businesses. These facilities are at discounted interest rates and better reflect the type of security small businesses have to offer. In particular, each of the major banks introduced a residential-secured product early in 1997, which enables small businesses to borrow at a variable rate, close to that on housing loans, with no customer risk margin. ", " In line with interest rates in capital markets – where fixed-rate loans are funded – indicator rates on fixed-rate loans have fallen further in recent months. The average interest rate on a fixed-rate housing loan with a term of three years has fallen by 0.6 of a percentage point to 6.7 per cent since the last cut in the cash rate in July, including a round of reductions by a number of banks in January. Since their recent peak in June 1996, these rates have fallen by 2.9 percentage points. In addition to these carded rates, several banks made available ‘special offers’ for fixed-rate housing finance during January. In January, the indicator rate on fixed-rate loans for business for a term of three years was 7.2 per cent, 0.2 of a percentage point lower than in July 1997. ", " The <em>average</em> interest rate actually paid on all outstanding fixed-rate loans has fallen by less than the relevant <em>indicator</em> rate. In the September quarter, the average interest rate on outstanding fixed-rate loans to small business fell by 0.4 of a percentage point, to 9.4 per cent; since the June quarter 1996, this rate has fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.2 percentage points</span>, compared with a fall in corresponding indicator rates of 2.8 percentage points. The reason the fall in the average interest rate on outstanding fixed-rate loans is smaller than the fall in the indicator rate is that lower indicator rates have not worked their way through the stock of outstanding fixed-rate loans and will not do so completely until that stock is fully rolled over. ", " The total weighted average interest rate on all small business loans (fixed and variable) fell by 0.7 of a percentage point in the September quarter 1997 to 9.3 per cent, 2.1 percentage points lower than in the June quarter of 1996. ", " Consumer prices in underlying terms rose by 0.3 per cent in the December quarter 1997, to be up by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.4 per cent</span> over the year. Annual underlying inflation has now fallen steadily from its most recent peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span> in the March quarter of 1996 to its current rate, which is the lowest since the series began in the early 1970s (Graph 23). ", " The headline CPI also rose by 0.3 per cent in the quarter, but was 0.2 per cent lower than a year ago. Falls in mortgage interest rates continue to reduce the headline series, detracting 0.3 of a percentage point in the December quarter 1997 and around 1¾ percentage points over the year. This effect on the headline CPI was offset in the quarter by increased health costs and higher prices for tobacco and selected food items. ", " The prices of domestically produced consumer goods rose by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.7 per cent</span> over the year, continuing the gradual slowing in growth evident in recent quarters (Graph 24). In the private sector, goods prices continue to rise considerably more slowly than services prices. Private-sector goods prices rose by only 0.7 per cent over the course of 1997, compared with a rise in the prices of private-sector services (which exclude interest charges) of 3.3 per cent. The price of imported consumer goods fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.2 per cent</span> in the quarter and by 2.6 per cent over the year – its largest annual fall on record. The biggest falls were for imported motor vehicles, but the prices of many other types of imported consumer goods also fell. ", " The continuing falls in the prices of imported consumer goods are largely a consequence of the appreciation of the Australian dollar early in 1996 and the maintenance of that higher level for most of 1997. In October 1997, however, the currency depreciated sharply in import-weighted terms, with the depreciation not being reversed until late January 1998. This had an immediate impact on both imported prices over the docks and imported producer prices (Graphs 25 and 26). The import price index rose by 4.2 per cent in the quarter, its largest quarterly rise in 11 years, to be up by 6.4 per cent over the year. Very similar prices rises, 4.0 per cent over the quarter and 6.3 per cent over the year, were recorded by imported final manufactured goods. That prices of imported products at the retail level <em>fell</em> in the December quarter reflects the fact that there are normally long lags in the pass-through of exchange rate movements to final retail prices. With the unwinding in January 1998 of the late 1997 currency depreciation, the sharp rises in over-the-docks import prices in the December quarter should be expected to have only limited impact on consumer prices. (See the later section, <a href=\"#inflation\">Inflation outlook</a>, for a discussion of the import-weighted and trade-weighted measures of the currency.) ", " The prices of domestic inputs have been picking up gradually for much of the past year. Over the year to the December quarter 1997, the price of domestic raw material inputs (including petroleum) rose by 2.0 per cent, while domestic intermediate goods prices rose by 2.4 per cent, in both cases the largest annual rises for two years. Reflecting this pick-up in input costs, domestically produced manufacturing prices have also edged up, rising by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter of 1997 and by 1.5 per cent over the year, also their highest annual rate for two years. ", " The ABS announced in November 1997 that it will replace the current CPI with an acquisitions-based CPI, which will exclude interest charges for mortgages and consumer credit. The price of home ownership will be measured by net expenditure on new dwellings (excluding land). A new group, Financial Services, will be incorporated in the index, as will the prices of some additional items that are forming a rising share of consumer spending (computers, tertiary education fees and domestic services). These changes will be introduced from the September quarter 1998. ", " The latest available data on earnings growth showed average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) increasing by 4.4 per cent over the year to August 1997 (Graph 27). This figure has been affected by some marked volatility in the quarterly movements, with AWOTE increasing by 1.9 per cent in the three months to August but only <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the previous three months. ", " There has for some time been a marked divergence between public- and private-sector components of wage growth, although more recently the two have begun to move closer together. Measured growth in public-sector AWOTE slowed to an annual rate of 6.1 per cent over the year to August, from a rate of 7.2 per cent the previous quarter. However, this remains higher than other indicators, particularly the enterprise bargaining data, would suggest. It is likely that aggregate public-sector earnings growth continues to be affected by compositional change within the sector, which contributes to some overstatement of the increase in wage rates. ", " In the private sector, AWOTE increased by 2.0 per cent in the three months to August, to be up by 4.0 per cent over the year. This compares with an estimated fall of 0.1 per cent in the three months to May, implying a rise of 2.5 per cent over the year to May. These quarterly numbers are, however, subject to a good deal of unavoidable statistical noise (driven partly by changes in the sample of firms from one survey to the next). The rise in the estimated annual growth of private-sector AWOTE from 2.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent probably owes more to this noise than to an underlying pick-up in private-sector wage growth. The former number probably understates private-sector wage growth, while the latter probably overstates it. ", " While there remains considerable uncertainty, annual wage growth (allowing for some over-statement in the public-sector AWOTE numbers) appears to be running at about 4 per cent, with the private-sector component probably somewhat lower. Wage growth at these rates does not represent a threat to the inflation target. From the perspective of employment, however, rates of wage growth over much of the past couple of years have been on the high side for an economy with very low inflation and an unemployment rate over 8 per cent. ", " The latest data on wage rises negotiated under enterprise agreements, covering the September quarter 1997, continue to show average annual outcomes in the 4½–5 per cent range, as they have done for some time <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 28)</span>. Some moderation of wage outcomes from private-sector enterprise agreements appears to have been occurring over recent quarters; new federal agreements registered in the September quarter 1997 yielded average annual increases of 4.4 per cent, compared with a revised 4.8 per cent in the previous quarter and over <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> for much of 1996. There remains much diversity between outcomes, but there are also indications that some major private-sector agreements are being renewed at lower rates. In the finance sector, re-negotiated agreements at the larger banks are yielding annualised wage increases in the 3 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> range (adjusting for the time since the expiry of previous agreements), down from 5½–6 per cent in previous agreements. In the public sector, some agreements during the first three quarters of 1997 yielded relatively high increases, but more recent indications are that agreements currently being renewed are in the 3 to 4 per cent range. Executive salaries, according to the Cullen Egan Dell survey, recorded their largest quarterly rise for more than seven years in the December quarter, returning the annual rate of growth to over 6 per cent. ", " By now, nearly all of the $10 per week increase in safety-net payments approved by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in April 1997 should have been paid to workers on awards. The Commission will now consider a claim by the ACTU for a flat dollar increase of $20.60 in all award wages, and a further $38 increase in the following year. ", " Most measures of inflation expectations remain close to their historical lows following significant declines in <span class=\"no-wrap\">late 1996</span> and into 1997. Nevertheless, consumers' and businesses' expectations of inflation over the medium term remain above the Bank's target. Expectations of financial market participants, by contrast, are consistent with the target, as has been the case for some time. ", " Consumer inflation expectations, as measured by the Melbourne Institute survey, after taking a clear downward step in late 1996, have mostly fluctuated in the 3–3 ½ per cent range since then (Graph 29). In the <span class=\"no-wrap\">January 1998</span> survey, however, the median expectation of inflation over the year ahead picked up to 3.6 per cent, from 3.1 per cent in December 1997, and above its average since late 1996. This pick-up may reflect consumers' perceptions of the implications of the exchange rate depreciation occurring around that time, since the majority of respondents reported hearing news about currency movements. ", " Near-term expectations of business selling prices remain subdued. The average expected rise in retail selling prices for the March quarter 1998 is 0.4 per cent in both the ABS and NAB surveys, similar to expectations in recent quarters. In the latest ACCI-Westpac and ACM surveys of the manufacturing sector, there have been small falls in the net balance of respondents expecting to raise selling prices. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations, as recorded in the latest NAB survey, have been generally steady, with most respondents continuing to nominate 3–4 per cent as the range in which inflation is most likely to be maintained over the next five to ten years. There has, however, been a gradual rise over time in the proportion of businesses expecting inflation to be maintained below 3 per cent and a corresponding fall in the proportion expecting it to be above 4 per cent over this period. Inflation expectations of participants in financial markets continue to be lower than those of consumers or businesses. The Bank's survey of financial market economists, taken just after release of the December quarter CPI figure, obtained a median forecast for underlying inflation over the year to June 1998 of 1.8 per cent, a slight decline from the previous reading. The forecast for the year to June 1999 increased slightly, from 2.6 to 2.7 per cent. On the latest readings, the indexed bond yield differential, a measure of longer-term market expectations, was implying an average inflation expectation of slightly above 2 per cent. ", " Annual inflation in underlying terms probably reached its trough in the December quarter of 1997. The Bank currently expects that inflation will gradually return to the 2–3 per cent target range over the year ahead. Over a slightly longer horizon, subject to some provisos, inflation should remain consistent with the target. Several factors will be at work in producing this outcome. ", " One element in the expected small rise in inflation over the coming year is that prices for internationally traded goods and services, which had for some time been declining as a result of the earlier appreciation in the Australian dollar, have now begun to rise following the decline in the currency in late 1997. The Australian dollar, after appreciating by about 10 per cent through 1995–96, sustained this higher level for most of 1997. In late 1997, however, it depreciated sharply against the US dollar and the major European currencies, while appreciating sharply against the currencies of East Asia. These divergent bilateral movements led to little net movement in the Australian-dollar <em>trade</em>-weighted index (TWI), but to a noticeable depreciation in the <em>import</em>-weighted index (IWI). The different behaviour of the two indices arises from the United States and Europe being relatively more important as sources for Australian imports than as destinations for Australian exports; currency movements against the US dollar and European currencies therefore have more influence on the import-weighted index than on the trade-weighted index. (See the article <em><a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1998/jan/1.html\">Alternative Measures of the Effects of Exchange Rate                      Movements on Competitiveness</a></em> in the January <cite>Bulletin</cite> for details.) ", " Of the two indices, the IWI is of more relevance for inflation since import prices have a direct (although delayed) influence on consumer prices. Over the three months to mid January of 1998, the IWI was about 4 per cent below its average value for the first nine months of 1997. Past experience suggests that, other things equal, a sustained depreciation of this size would be expected to raise consumer price inflation by a little less than <span class=\"no-wrap\">½per cent</span> over the ensuing year or so. Since mid January, however, this depreciation of the import-weighted exchange rate has been unwound, suggesting that the impetus to consumer price inflation will be quite small. Nevertheless, the extended period of declining import prices at the retail level and their restraining influence on economy-wide inflation seems to have come to an end. ", " A second factor is that over the past year, the economy has been expanding at a rate which is probably a little faster than its likely longer-term potential, with domestic demand in particular growing quite strongly. In the short term, this is likely to continue, and excess capacity will be gradually declining. There should be scope for this to continue for some time before serious capacity constraints are encountered. Nonetheless, as slack is wound back, there is the possibility that firms which have suffered some squeeze on profit margins over the past couple of years may seek to recoup this by raising prices at a rate ahead of the increase in their costs. ", " Over the medium term, developments in labour costs will, as always, be important in determining price trends. As detailed above, the Bank's assessment is that economy-wide wages growth is running at about 4 per cent on average. Non-farm labour productivity has been growing at an annual trend rate of 1.6 per cent since the beginning of the current economic expansion in mid 1991 and, over the past two years, it has grown substantially more quickly. The recent pick-up in productivity growth may partly reflect a response by employers to the stronger wage pressures in 1994 and 1995, and it is unlikely that such exceptional productivity growth will be sustained. Nonetheless, a continuation of the average rate of productivity growth for this recovery would, with current rates of wages growth, keep unit labour costs rising at an acceptably low rate. ", " The outlook for wages depends importantly on the strength of the labour market. With a firmer trend in employment growth, there is the possibility that labour costs might, in time, accelerate. It is too soon yet, however, to expect to see much evidence of this, particularly since the unemployment rate, while falling, remains relatively high. Some impetus to labour costs may arise from the current safety net review, depending on the AIRC's response to the claim. ", " A fourth factor is inflation expectations, which have declined noticeably through the past year and a half. Some increase in expectations of inflation over the year ahead has been recorded lately, but this appears to be a proportionate response to the likely short-term effects of movements in the exchange rate, rather than a more fundamental erosion of confidence in low inflation. That inflation expectations remain close to the lowest levels for a generation should be expected to play a role in keeping both wage and price aspirations to realistic levels. ", " A final factor which needs to be considered is the state of inflation in the rest of the world. There has been considerable attention given in some popular discussion to the possibility of global deflation arising from the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian crisis</span>, with the claim that a ‘global glut’ of goods sourced from Asia might precipitate a slump in prices and economic activity world wide. ", " At the present time, world prices for traded goods and services are broadly stable, as they have been for <span class=\"no-wrap\">much of 1996 and 1997</span>. Commodity prices have declined to some extent, after having risen in 1996 and the first half of 1997. A situation when these prices are not rising is quite common. There have been several occasions over the past 15 years when international trade prices for goods and commodities have declined. In the <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1980s</span>, the declines in commodity prices were much larger than they have been so far on this occasion. Nor in the bulk of the industrialised economies has there been a large, debt financed run-up in asset prices, which is the usual precondition for a sharp deflation (and has been in operation in Asia in the present episode). At the margin, however, the decline in absorption by the Asian economies can be expected to be mildly disinflationary in world markets, helping to keep inflation in Australia contained.

Real non-farm GDP expanded by 3¾ per cent, led by strong private-sector domestic demand. Underlying consumer price inflation was 1½ per cent, influenced by declining prices for imports but also containment of domestic costs. This performance compares well with international experience. ", " In 1998, on present indications, growth is likely to be somewhat lower, and inflation higher, than the 1997 outcomes. The principal reason for this is that the international environment facing the Australian economy has become increasingly difficult over the past year or so. The financial crisis in east Asia is, not unexpectedly, requiring very sharp contractions in the countries directly concerned, and indirectly is dampening growth around the region generally. This has reduced Asian demand for goods and services produced in the rest of the world, including Australia, and it is clear that Australian exporters are suffering a significant fall in sales to east Asia at present. ", " Economic conditions in the United States remain very strong, and they are improving in Europe. The direct impact of the east Asian problems on these important regions is probably not large, although the US economy is likely to slow in 1998 in response to several factors. Perhaps the biggest uncertainty in the global growth outlook at present is in respect of Japan, where the economic situation has deteriorated further over recent months. This has not had much effect on Australian exports to Japan, but is adding to the impact of the east Asian problems on global growth, and could dampen prospects for recovery in the east Asian economies. Overall, it seems unlikely that there will be an early improvement in the international trading environment. ", " Financial markets in Australia, although not directly caught up in the financial turmoil that engulfed the region, have nonetheless been affected by the actual and expected economic consequences of the crisis – notably weakening export demand and falling commodity prices. This has led to a fall in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar and lower bond yields; the share market, while rising, has underperformed markets in most other industrial countries. These adjustments in financial prices have taken place over a period of nearly a year and, apart from a brief period in January, have occurred in an orderly manner. ", " There is nothing that Australian economic policy can do to prevent this worsening of external conditions. The task for policies is to support the economy's capacity to adjust to changed circumstances. In this regard, at the macroeconomic level at least, past policy investments are paying off. Public finances are in good shape, inflation is low, and balance sheets of businesses and financial institutions are strong. It is inevitable that the current account deficit will widen in 1998 – that process is already well under way. A short-term widening of this nature does not reflect inadequacies in current economic policies and, in itself, is not an issue of direct concern for monetary policy. ", " At this stage, the Bank's assessment remains that domestic demand has sufficient momentum, despite some weaker statistics just recently, to drive moderate growth in output in 1998. That process is being given considerable assistance by the current stance of monetary policy. Credit is readily available on attractive terms, and financial intermediation is proceeding at a strong pace. Few borrowers are under any cash-flow constraint as a result of interest payments. Those areas of private spending usually thought to be interest sensitive, such as housing, business investment and certain consumer durables (such as motor vehicles) have been strong. Asset markets have been reasonably buoyant, although generally not overheated, and the increase in private financial wealth over the past year was the strongest for a number of years. The exchange rate has declined relative to most other currencies (which will give some assistance to exporters seeking to find new markets, just as it is cushioning the prices of commodities measured in Australian dollars). These are all signs that the declines in interest rates over the past couple of years have been having their expected effect. ", " The lower exchange rate also means that the period of declining underlying consumer price inflation which began in 1996 has now reached an end. Falls in prices for traded goods and services which occurred during 1997 are in the process of being at least partly reversed. At the same time, the trend in domestic costs has shown signs of gradual deceleration over the past couple of years. Overall, the Bank's central forecast is that there will be a modest increase in the annual underlying inflation rate, to around 2 per cent by the end of 1998, and around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> by the middle of 1999 – a result in line with the inflation target. ", " Under these circumstances, the Bank is comfortable for the present in maintaining the current structure of short-term interest rates. The stance of policy will, naturally, be continually reviewed as new information comes to hand about the likely course of inflation and activity, including the impact of the Asian crisis on growth and the strength of domestic demand. ", " The turmoil in Asian financial markets reached its peak in January. Indonesia was the country most affected, its exchange rate at one point depreciating by about 80 per cent from mid-1997 levels, but the exchange rates of Korea, Thailand and Malaysia also had fallen sharply to levels about 50 per cent below pre-crisis levels (Graph 1). Singapore and Taiwan, and to a degree, the Philippines, managed to negotiate this period with smaller depreciations. In fact, the falls in the Singaporean and Taiwanese currencies against the US dollar were of similar magnitude to that of the Australian dollar. Hong Kong and China have been able to maintain unchanged exchange rates against the US dollar throughout the entire crisis. ", " Since January, the situation in financial markets has improved. Confidence began to return as Thailand and Korea proceeded with the implementation of measures agreed as part of their IMF packages. (Details of the size of the various packages are outlined in <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>.) Both countries have begun the process of liquidating insolvent financial institutions and the restructuring of viable ones. Moves have also been made to reschedule foreign debt and, in Korea, to reform the labour market. Korea was able to roll over the bulk of the short-term debt incurred by its banks, first on a temporary basis, and then into bonds of up to three years maturity. Useable foreign reserves have been substantially rebuilt in both countries. As a result of these confidence-building developments, the currencies of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines have recovered ground, although they still remain around <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span> lower than pre-crisis levels; the exchange rates of Singapore and Taiwan are now down by only 10–15 per cent against the US dollar compared with mid-1997 levels. The pace of improvement in confidence has, however, slowed in recent weeks due to concerns about the regional implications of the weakness in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Japan (see below)</span>. ", " For a time, Indonesia was an exception to this general trend. While the announcement of the original IMF package was well received initially, this gave way early in 1998 to a lengthy period of uncertainty over how closely the Indonesian authorities would adhere to the agreement. During this period, the Indonesian rupiah slid to extremely low levels, and Indonesian banks and corporates were unable to carry on their normal dealings in international markets. The currency was briefly supported by speculation about the introduction of a currency board involving a peg of the rupiah to the US dollar at a much higher level, but this was later ruled out as unsustainable. ", " In early April, the IMF and the Indonesian authorities negotiated a new agreement, reflecting the changed circumstances of the Indonesian economy. The new agreement includes, amongst other things, a process for managing the large foreign-currency debt owed by Indonesian banks and companies. The package should allow the resumption of financial assistance to Indonesia, conditional on the Indonesian authorities' implementation of agreed measures. This has seen some firming in the value of the rupiah and, as of early May, it had risen to about 8000 to the US dollar, still down by about 70 per cent from pre-crisis levels. This size of depreciation will make economic management in Indonesia very difficult, as indicated by the sharp increase in inflation to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> in recent months. ", " With exchange pressures generally easing in the region, it has been possible for all countries, apart from Indonesia, to start to reverse the sharp increases in interest rates that occurred in late 1997/early 1998 (Graph 2). In most cases, however, interest rates still remain at high levels; only Hong Kong and Singapore have been able to reverse most of the earlier rise. ", " Share markets in the region have also recovered. At their lows around the turn of the year, share prices were down by about 40 per cent on average from early 1997 levels (Graph 3). Through January and February, about half of this fall was reversed. More recently, markets have weakened again; flow-on effects of the weakness in Japan have contributed to this but, more generally, share markets are likely to remain nervous until clear signs emerge of economic recovery in these economies. In summary, the situation in south-east Asian financial markets is improving, but confidence remains fragile. ", " The economic fall-out from the currency and financial crises is, of course, far from over. In the countries most affected by the crisis, current account positions have moved into surplus. This is common in cases where there is a more or less complete loss of investor confidence: current account deficits which were formerly the counterparts of substantial inflows of private capital have to close abruptly, as capital flows out. Since last June, the total current account adjustment of Thailand, Korea and Indonesia combined has been of the order of <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$40 billion</span> (at an annual rate). ", " So far, the vast bulk of the balance of payments adjustment has been via lower imports (Graph 4). Measured in <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> terms, imports have fallen by about one-third from their pre-crisis levels. To date, exports have shown little tendency to increase more quickly in US dollar terms, although this probably disguises some volume increase as exporters lowered their US dollar prices. In some other Asian countries, exports appear to have slowed, which would be at least partly explained by the decline in trade with other countries under strain. ", " The fall in imports has been produced partly by the depreciation of currencies, which has made imports much more expensive (and which is also pushing up inflation rates), but more importantly reflects sharp contractions in domestic demand. The latter in turn have been a result of much higher interest rates, tighter budgetary policies and the adjustments flowing from deflating asset prices and the unwinding of over-stretched financial positions. As a result, domestic production is declining, and business bankruptcies and unemployment are increasing. ", " The stress on banks in several countries has also resulted in a severe reduction in the availability of trade credit. This form of credit is crucial to the flow of traded goods. It relies on banks being prepared to assume risk in the form of a letter of credit drawn on another bank in a foreign country. The difficulties being faced by banks in some of the troubled Asian countries have tended to make banks in countries which trade with the Asian region wary of trade-financing activities. Since many Asian exports rely on imported components of one kind or another, this can amount to a constraint on the ability to export. Governments in some other countries, including Australia, have been prepared to alleviate this problem by increasing the availability of insurance for export sales into Asia. The reliance of Asian producers on imported components and raw materials also lessens somewhat the degree of gain in competitiveness conferred on them by the depreciation of their currencies. ", " The impact of the decline in intra-regional trade in Asia, as well as of the general tightening of financial conditions in most countries in the region, is now beginning to have an impact on some countries not directly in crisis. Domestic demand in Hong Kong and Singapore, for example, appears to be slowing. Growth in China, for many years very strong, also appears to be gradually slowing down, although this is mainly due to domestic factors. An exception to this general trend is Taiwan, which seems to be weathering the storm better than most. ", " Because of these developments, most expectations are that the east Asian region as a whole will record much more subdued growth in 1998 than has been the norm in the past. Pronounced recessions are already under way in Thailand, Indonesia and Korea; other countries will continue to record growth, but in most cases it will be the weakest performance in over a decade. ", " If the recent stabilisation in financial markets signifies some easing in the financial constraints facing the countries in crisis, then production and demand might be expected to reach a trough at some time in the next year. If financial markets can be kept on a stable footing, and the progressive implementation of the various reform programs continued, then the preconditions for a gradual recovery in economic activity beginning in 1999 may come into place. In several important instances in east Asia, this appears to be the current trend, but it is too early yet to say that a general recovery is beginning. Even when it does commence, the likelihood is that growth rates will be considerably lower than seen between 1990 and 1996. ", " The United States economy recorded an exceptionally good combination of strong growth and low inflation during 1997. Strong gains in employment reduced the rate of unemployment to below 5 per cent for the first time in a generation. This tightening of labour markets has led to some pick-up in the rate of growth of labour costs, but consumer price inflation declined during 1997, a result of a higher US dollar, gains in productivity and lower energy prices. ", " Most observers expect that US growth will have slowed by the end of 1998, and that this will prevent a pick-up in inflation. Early indications are that domestic demand has remained reasonably robust so far this year, but the US traded-goods sector is being affected by the reduction in demand in east Asia and, more importantly, the rise in the value of the US dollar. ", " The major European economies continue to present a mixed picture. The UK is apparently at or near a growth peak. France and Italy are both recording a pick-up in growth, led by domestic demand. Activity is also strengthening in Germany. Until recently, this has been heavily dependent on export expansion, with significant restructuring in the German corporate sector dampening employment and consumer confidence, and hence domestic demand. There are now signs that conditions in the labour market are improving, although this is yet to translate into a sustained pick-up in consumer spending. ", " This strengthening of domestic demand in Europe is being supported by easy financial conditions, with both <span class=\"no-wrap\">short- and</span> long-term interest rates at quite low levels. Any dampening effects on activity of fiscal consolidation required to meet the Maastricht criteria also are likely to be waning over the year ahead. It therefore seems likely that growth in Europe in 1998, led by domestic expansion, will match the quite good rates achieved in 1997, despite the impact of lost sales to the Asian region. ", " In fact, the direct exposure of both the US and European economies to east Asian countries other than Japan is relatively small (Table 1). Lost export sales to these countries are likely to be of far less importance to the European economies and the US than they will be to Australia. For this reason, it seems unlikely that the financial crisis in east Asia will precipitate a major global slowing in growth – although there will be some effect. A major slump is also less likely if policy-makers in major economies take the effect of Asia into account in their deliberations, which they appear to be doing. ", " A bigger risk to the global outlook is the economic situation in Japan, where the economy relapsed into recession around the middle of 1997. Real GDP recovered some of the large June quarter decline in September, only to fall again in December. If anything, downward pressure on economic activity has intensified over recent months, with industrial production declining further in the early part of 1998. Consumer demand has been weakening, and inventories rising, suggesting that further weakness in output is likely in the short term. ", " Most significant business cycle events occur because of a combination of forces, and this is no exception. The process of fiscal consolidation last year began to have its effect just as the economies of some of Japan's important regional trading partners were about to retrench sharply. This was a coincidence which could not have been foreseen. The deeper structural weakness in the Japanese economy, however, has for some years been the weak state of the financial system resulting from the lingering effects of the collapse of the ‘bubble economy’ of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Over recent months, the dampening forces on the economy have been amplified as banks have restrained the expansion of credit in an effort to strengthen their own balance sheets. An indication of the weakness of these balance sheets is that loans outstanding to bankrupt companies were at their highest-ever level in 1997. ", " Japanese exports performed quite well through 1997, assisted by the more competitive exchange rate relative to other major countries. This helps to explain a quite strong performance of Australian exports to Japan during 1997, after a number of years of very little growth (Graph 5), although more recently these have weakened. Australia's exports to Japan are dominated by resources, which are an input into the Japanese export industries. Japan's exports to Asia, however, are being affected by the crisis in those countries. At the same time, the sluggish state of domestic demand in Japan weakens prospects for the east Asian countries to grow through export. ", " The main short-term requirement in Japan is macroeconomic measures which will re-start growth in domestic demand, boost confidence and stabilise the banking system. Some of these elements have been gradually coming into place over the past six months or so, with the most recent development the announcement of a sizeable fiscal stimulus package in late April. The package is costed at 17 trillion yen (3 per cent of GDP) and includes a temporary income tax cut and an increase in public-works spending. ", " The extent of the crisis in east Asia and the separate, although related, problems in Japan have seen a significant downward revision to global growth estimates published by the official international institutions such as the OECD and the IMF, as well as those of international private forecasters. In the IMF's recently released forecasts, a downward revision of 1¼ percentage points for world GDP growth (to 3.1 per cent) in 1998 is fully accounted for by the direct effect of lower growth in east Asia and Japan (Table 2). ", " In the US, financial markets have seen at least one positive aspect of the Asian crisis as well as the familiar negative ones. The positive aspect is that, by depressing commodity prices and encouraging further strength in the US dollar, events in Asia have allowed rapid growth in domestic demand in the US to continue for longer than might otherwise have been possible without adding to inflationary pressures. As a result, US financial markets have continued to perform very strongly. The US dollar has risen by 12 per cent in trade-weighted terms over the past 18 months, the share market has continued to set records and US bond yields have fallen to low levels. At <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.6 per cent</span>, the yield on 10-year US bonds is barely above the US cash rate – i.e. financial markets are so confident about the continuing good outlook for inflation that lenders are willing to invest for 10 years at much the same interest rate as that on overnight money. ", " The low interest rate environment and good company profitability have supported the US share market. But, after a rise of close to 140 per cent over the past three years or so, share valuations have reached unprecedented levels, and can be sustained only by continuing good news on inflation and company profitability. With the economy pushing hard against capacity, this will prove increasingly difficult. ", " Share markets in many other industrial countries have strengthened along with that in the US and, in fact, the increases in share prices in Europe have run ahead of those in the US in recent times (Table 3). As in the US, low interest rates, due in some cases to the convergence of rates in the lead up to European monetary union, are an important part of the explanation. Signs of a more sure-footed economic recovery and the flow-through to profits of corporate cost-cutting in recent years have also contributed. ", " In Japanese financial markets, further weakness in the economy has produced the usual responses: bond yields have fallen to new lows of 1.5 per cent, the lowest long-term bond yield in any country for several centuries; the share market has fallen by about 25 per cent since mid 1997 to levels about 60 per cent below the early 1990s peak; and the exchange rate of the Japanese yen has fallen against other major currencies (15 per cent against the US dollar and 10 per cent against the German mark). Short-term interest rates remain at their historic lows of 0.5 per cent, where they have been for the past 2½ years.  ", " The fortunes of the Australian dollar over the past six months have mainly reflected developments in east Asia. The exchange rate has declined against the US dollar over this period, reaching its weakest point in January when the turmoil in Asia was at its height (Graph 6). The low point was US63.2 cents, a fall of US12 cents from the mid-1997 level, and the lowest exchange rate against the US dollar since the mid 1980s. ", " With the Asian situation subsequently improving, the Australian dollar recovered to some degree, at one point regaining US68 cents. However, as was the general experience of other currencies in the region, it has been affected recently by events in Japan and has returned to under US65 cents. This represents a net depreciation of 18 per cent against the US dollar over the past year. ", " The independent strength of the US dollar on world markets has been an important factor in this, but it is only part of the explanation. The Australian dollar has fallen against most currencies. Over the past year, for example, it has fallen against 19 of the 26 countries in the trade-weighted index. Such developments would normally be reflected in a fall in the trade-weighted index, but this has not happened on this occasion because of the exceptionally large increases against the currencies of the troubled Asian economies. ", " As was discussed in the article on ‘Alternative Measures of the Effects of Exchange Rate Movements on Competitiveness’ in the Bank's January <cite>Bulletin</cite>, the widely divergent path of the Australian dollar as between the major currencies and the currencies of east Asia means that the trade-weighted index has not been as useful a measure of overall exchange rate moves of the Australian dollar as in more settled times. The recent moves in the index are difficult to interpret because they combine a sharp appreciation against the currencies of countries to which Australia exports with a sharp depreciation against those of countries from which Australia imports. The Bank's judgment is that, on the whole, the movements in bilateral exchange rates have had a stimulative effect on economic activity and inflation in Australia. ", " In the unsettled conditions of late 1997 and January 1998, with exchange rate movements threatening to become self reinforcing, the Bank undertook some modest intervention in the market to restore orderly conditions. This was the first such intervention since November 1993. It involved total purchases of <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollars</span> of $400 million; so far in 1998, a purchase of $100 million in early January has been the only intervention. Although the exchange rate has passed through a wide range since then, trading has remained orderly and the Bank has not seen a need to intervene. ", " The bond market in Australia participated in the global bond rally (Graph 7). Since the previous <cite class=\"no-wrap\">Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, the yield on 10-year bonds has shown a net fall of 20 basis points, to around 5.75 per cent. This is the lowest level since the early 1970s, a time when interest rates were set by the Government and financial institutions were required to hold substantial amounts of bonds under the so-called ‘captive’ arrangements. ", " While bond yields in most countries have fallen sharply since the peak in late 1994, the fall has been larger in Australia than in most other countries. Accordingly, the spread between yields on Australian and overseas securities has fallen. The premium for Australian bonds over US security yields, which had been as high as <span class=\"no-wrap\">300 basis points</span> as recently as three years ago, is currently less than 10 basis points and has averaged 25 basis points since mid 1997 (Graph 8). Continuing good news on inflation and the strong fiscal position have been the main factors driving this narrowing of the spread. ", " Spreads between bonds issued by different countries reflect both credit risk (i.e. differences in credit standing) and currency risk, i.e. the risk of changes in exchange rates, an important element of which, over the long term, is differences in rates of inflation. It is not possible to measure directly the extent to which each of these factors is contributing to the current spread between Australian and US bonds as the Australian government has no actively-traded borrowings in the US dollar market. However, other sovereigns with credit ratings similar to Australia who borrow in the US market are paying spreads of 20–30 basis points over US Treasury securities. This implies that the inflation risk built into the current Australian/US bond spread is, in fact, negative – i.e. markets are pricing Australian bonds on the basis that Australian inflation, which is currently below that in the US, will remain so. ", " Another indication of the good inflation outcomes priced into Australian bonds can be seen in the difference between nominal yields and the real yields on indexed bonds; this gap largely reflects inflationary expectations over the life of the bond, and is about 2 percentage points at present. ", " Following the five easings of monetary policy between July 1996 and July 1997, the cash rate has been held unchanged at 5.0 per cent. Over this time, the market assessments of future changes to monetary policy have varied between expectations of a tightening and a loosening, mainly in response to short-run fluctuations in the economic data becoming available. ", " Market expectations about monetary policy can be observed in a variety of ways, but one relatively simple way is by comparing the market yield on three-month securities to the overnight cash rate. This is because arbitrage by market participants works to ensure that three-month interest rates reflect the expected average cash rate over that period. Expectations for an easing of policy – i.e. a reduction in the cash rate – will result in three-month yields falling below the current cash rate, while expectations of a tightening will result in the reverse. ", " As can be seen from Graph 9, in the months immediately following the easing in July 1997, markets continued to price in some expectations of further easings. Such trend-following behaviour is not uncommon in markets, both here in Australia and overseas; it was also evident in early 1995 after the tightenings of late 1994. ", " By December 1997, however, following the run of strong data on economic activity, markets had moved to price in a tightening of policy. Thereafter, as the Asian crisis worsened, and market observers began to predict a significant negative impact on the Australian economy, those expectations of a tightening were unwound. By March, they had been replaced by expectations of an easing, although these expectations are not as confidently held as back in the September quarter 1997. These swings in sentiment have been relatively mild and the frequency with which they have changed suggests that expectations are not confidently held. ", " Around the world, official interest rates have been relatively steady by past standards, but, to the extent that there has been any trend over the past year, it has been towards tightening (see Table 4, which shows the net change in official interest rates in industrial countries over the past year). Three countries – New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom – have implemented significant increases in interest rates. The former two have done so largely because of weakness in their exchange rates, the last because of the strength of its economy. Most European countries have also raised interest rates. Four industrial countries have reduced interest rates; apart from Australia, the other three were those European countries with above-average interest rates which reduced them as part of the convergence of rates in the lead up to European monetary union. ", " The Australian economy is now entering its seventh year of low-inflation expansion. The pace of growth picked up during 1997, with real non-farm GDP expanding by 3¾ per cent over the year. In the latter part of the year, this strength began to flow through to the labour market, generating stronger employment growth and a noticeable drop in the unemployment rate. ", " The general pick-up in momentum reflected stronger growth in most components of private demand, with strength particularly evident in consumer spending and housing construction. Overall, private demand grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">6½ per cent</span> over the year and total domestic demand by 5½ per cent (although, as noted in <a href=\"#box_d\">Box D</a> (p. 28), this strength is slightly over stated by conventional constant-price estimates). Some of the growth in private demand was absorbed by a rundown in stocks and by faster growth in imports (Table 5). ", " Early indications are that domestic demand has maintained momentum in the early part of 1998, but that the effects of the slowdown in Asia are becoming more apparent in the form of declines in export sales to a number of countries in the region. Although other markets have remained strong, the result has been a weaker aggregate export performance in the latter part of 1997 and early 1998. Weaker external conditions are thus providing some offset to the strength in domestic demand. The net effect will depend importantly on the extent of any indirect effects acting on business and consumer confidence. Overall, growth in 1998 is likely to be slower than that recorded in 1997. ", " Strong growth in consumer spending has been an important contributor to overall growth in activity over the past year. Consumer spending increased by 5 per cent in real terms over the year to December 1997, and over the second half of the year the increase was just over 7 per cent at an annual rate. This followed a much weaker period in the second half of 1996. The pick-up has been widespread across most categories of consumer spending but was particularly noticeable for spending on retail goods, motor vehicles and entertainment and recreation. ", " Taking 1997 as a whole, the most striking area of growth was in purchases of motor vehicles (Graph 10). Spending on this component increased by more than 25 per cent over the year to the December quarter, contributing a full percentage point to the growth in consumption over the period. One factor contributing to the increase in sales has been a period of intense price competition in the industry, which has seen motor vehicle prices decline by around 10 per cent over the past two years. As well as being influenced by short-term movements in the exchange rate and resultant effects on prices of imported vehicles, this trend seems to reflect a more fundamental condition of over-capacity in the world car industry which has helped to maintain a general downward pressure on prices. Another factor has been the low level of interest rates and ready availability of finance for car purchases. The value of loan approvals for the purchase of new motor vehicles increased by around 25 per cent over the year to the December quarter. Latest monthly figures on vehicle registrations suggest that there has been a pause in growth of vehicle purchases in the early months of 1998, which is not surprising given the extraordinary growth that occurred over the previous year. There have also been reports of local manufacturers having difficulty keeping up with demand. ", " Retail trade has maintained an upward trend in recent months but at a slower pace than was recorded in the second half of 1997 (Graph 11). In the March quarter, sales increased by 0.3 per cent in real terms, to be up by 2.8 per cent over the year, following an increase of 3.9 per cent over the year to December. Individual monthly figures continue to be quite volatile, particularly those relating to department stores, where ongoing changes in seasonal patterns make interpretation of the data difficult. It is likely that total consumption has continued to grow more strongly than its retail component, given the strong medium-term trend in spending on services such as entertainment and recreation which are not included in retail trade. ", " The strong growth in spending through 1997 was supported by solid rises in household incomes. Real household disposable income increased by 3 per cent over the year, and at an annual rate of 5 per cent in the second half of the year, boosted by stronger growth in employment. Financial conditions and buoyant levels of consumer confidence were also supportive of spending growth, which outpaced growth in incomes during the year, implying a declining saving ratio. Capital gains arising from the Telstra float may also have boosted household spending in the recent period (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>). ", " In the early part of 1998, consumers may be adopting a more cautious attitude in the face of greater uncertainties about the international outlook and about employment prospects. Some lessening of consumer confidence is suggested by recent results from the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment survey. The survey points to greater pessimism in recent months in relation to general economic conditions and employment prospects, although consumers have remained relatively up-beat about their personal financial situations, and overall consumer confidence remains above its long-term average. Consumer spending is likely to be boosted later in the year by the impact on household wealth of AMP demutualisation (<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>). ", " Demand for residential property has continued to increase over the past year, leading to solid growth in activity in the housing sector. In the December quarter, the number of private house commencements increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span>, to be up by more than 20 per cent over the year as a whole (Graph 12). In dollar terms, the increase over the year was nearly 30 per cent. Local government building approvals have shown broadly similar growth to that in commencements, although with slightly different timing, and they suggest further growth in the early part of 1998. In the March quarter, the number of private dwellings approved for construction increased by about 1½ per cent, continuing the upward trend seen over the past year. Given lags in the completion of residential construction, these increases in approvals and commencements will flow through into further expansion in building activity during 1998. ", " The difference in growth rates between number s and values of dwelling commencements points to one significant difference between the current and previous housing upswings. In the current cycle to date, the number of houses being built has increased less rapidly than in previous cycles, but this has to some extent been offset by faster growth in the average value per dwelling being built, reflecting improvements in average size and quality (<a href=\"#box_c\">Box C</a>). ", " The strength in housing demand continues to be facilitated by a high level of finance commitments. In the three months to February, the value of loan approvals for housing was 18 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 13). Lending to investors in residential property has grown particularly strongly in the current upswing, with the value of new loan commitments almost doubling over the past two years. As has been the case during previous upswings, the expansion in finance commitments was initially led by loans for the purchase of existing dwellings but, more recently, lending for the finance of new construction activity has been accounting for more of the growth. ", " Latest indications are that the pace of lending growth may have been easing in recent months, although that would not be the first time that such a pause has occurred in the current upswing. Another weaker sign is that there has been a leveling out of activity in the medium-density component of housing construction. Nonetheless, demand for housing continues to be supported by historically high levels of affordability and by a rising aggregate level of household income. Interest rates on housing loans are at their lowest levels since the late 1960s, and measures of repayment burdens in relation to household incomes are also historically low. The strength of investor interest has been driven by attractive financing terms, an expanding rental market and low levels of vacancy rates in rental properties. Vacancy rates have begun to increase in Sydney, however, as a large volume of stock has come on to the market. ", " The high levels of demand and affordability have been putting upward pressure on house prices (Graph 14). The market has been particularly strong in Melbourne over the past year, where median house pr ices have increased by 12 per cent. In Sydney, which was the first of the capital cities to show a strong upturn, house prices have continued to rise, although the rate of increase has been easing recently. In both cities, house price increases were initially concentrated in inner city areas, and probably reflected a shift in preferences towards those areas rather than a generalised state of excess demand. Recently there has been a tendency for price pressures to spread more widely although the Sydney experience suggests that, as this has occurred, prices have tended to rise at a slower rate than was initially recorded in the inner city areas. In most other capitals, house prices have been picking up over the past year but the rate of increase has remained moderate. ", " Increases in output were recorded for most major industry groups over 1997. The strongest increases were in the service industries, particularly property and communications, and growth was also significantly above average in construction and retailing. Conditions in the manufacturing sector were rather weaker, with output rising by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> according to the ABS production accounts over the year as a whole, and declining in the second half of the year. In general, the more internationally exposed industries (or those that are exposed to Asia) have faced more difficult conditions recently, while sector s such as retailing and construction have benefited from the strong pick-up in domestic demand. ", " Notwithstanding the solid overall expansion in production, it remains the case that businesses in general have found it difficult to maintain or increase their profitability. Profit growth has been constrained by continuing competitive pressure on prices, which has kept average increases in selling prices to less than 2 per cent per annum for the past two years. Total profitability of the corporate sector, as measured by the ratio of gross operating surplus to GDP, has experienced a gradual decline through 1996 and 1997, illustrating the strength of competitive pressures on the supply side at a time when domestic demand conditions have been quite strong. ", " Going against the overall trend, profits in the construction sector have been increasing strongly, reflecting the upswing in building activity currently under way. In the manufacturing sector, some rebuilding of profits has been occurring over the past year, following a significant deterioration in 1996. The improved recent performance seems to reflect a deceleration in wage settlements in the industry, which had earlier been a pace-setter. Nonetheless, manufacturers have some way to go in restoring earlier profit levels, which in nominal terms are still below their 1994/95 peak. ", " Surveys of business sentiment have until recently been suggesting moderately rising confidence, consistent with the improving trend in demand and output over the past year. The latest readings, no doubt influenced by uncertainties raised by the Asian crisis, point to some reversal of that trend. Medium-term expectations, in particular, have fallen sharply over the last two quarters and are now around their levels of a couple of years ago. ", " Most surveys have also started to point to a decline in confidence with respect to the near-term outlook although, at an economy-wide level, the dip in confidence has not been particularly pronounced (Graph 15). The NAB survey for the March quarter reports moderately lower expectations in relation to sales, profitability and employment across most industries; in broad terms, these indicators have moved back to around their levels of a year ago. The Dun and Bradstreet survey, which covers the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors, gives a contrasting reading, suggesting that business confidence has continued to improve, while the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers points to a more marked deterioration in recent quarters. ", " More obvious signs of an impact of the Asian crisis on business expectations are found in survey results specifically related to export sales. Most surveys have been recording a more marked deterioration in the outlook for exports than they have for total sales. Manufacturing-based surveys have tended to point to a more significant drop in confidence than is evident for the economy as a whole, and there is also greater-than-average pessimism in the mining industry, which may be related to developments in world commodity prices. As might be expected, business respondents have expressed some concern when asked specifically whether the Asian crisis would be likely to have an adverse impact on the business environment. ", " The full extent of any such impact will depend not just on the direct effects on exports, but also importantly on whether resultant uncertainties lead to significant revisions to business investment plans. At this stage, there is little evidence of that occurring. Business investment continued to grow strongly through 1997, particularly in relation to plant and equipment. This type of investment spending increased by 15 per cent in real terms over the year, its fourth successive year of strong growth. Investment in buildings and structures showed little growth during the year, its upward trend being interrupted by the completion of work on the Crown casino project in Melbourne in mid year. Nonetheless, as discussed further below, there have been strong rises in commencements. In total, business investment increased by 12.5 per cent over the year. Alternative annually chained estimates to be adopted later this year by the ABS would suggest that this figure somewhat overstates investment growth but, even allowing for that, investment growth has continued at well-above-average rates (see <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a> for a discussion of the general implications of the move to annually chained estimates). ", " Most industries participated in this solid growth in investment. Mining has remained the strongest area of growth, with projects in the oil and gas and base-metals sectors contributing strongly. Shorter-term swings in sentiment in the industry, including the recent decline in confidence, do not seem to have had a significant effect on investment intentions, which are often subject to very long planning horizons. There was also strong investment growth in the wholesale and retailing industries. In the manufacturing sector, investment levels have been rather weak for the past couple of years, but began to recover towards the end of 1997. This pattern has broadly reflected, with a lag, trends in profitability, although manufacturing output remained weak. ", " Surveys of business investment intentions are generally pointing to continued growth, and do not reveal any systematic tendency for firms to scale back their plans in the wake of the Asian crisis. According to the ABS capital expenditure survey, conducted in January and early February, business investment intentions for the 1998/99 financial year are 20 per cent higher than the corresponding estimate for 1997/98 taken a year earlier (although this increase comes from an unusually low base). The NAB survey has continued to report investment plans similar to levels that have been recorded over the past couple of years, with only a small downward revision to expectations in the most recent quarters. The ACCI-Westpac survey of the manufacturing sector is noticeably more pessimistic about investment plans, consistent with its more pessimistic assessment of manufacturing conditions more generally and with that sector's greater exposure to trade than the economy-wide average. ", " Forward indicator s of construction investment activity are pointing to continued growth in the near term. Although work done on non-residential building projects eased back in mid 1997, reflecting the completion of the Crown casino project, commencements and the stock of work yet to be done have continued to trend upwards <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 16)</span>. The value of buildings commenced in the December quarter reached its highest level so far in the current upswing, and was 14 per cent higher than a year earlier. The value of building approvals, however, has declined in recent months, though this series is quite volatile. There has been strong growth in commencements of engineering construction projects, which increased by 31 per cent over the year (Graph 17). This strength reflects continued expansion in both resource-related projects and private-sector infrastructure. The high level of outstanding work yet to be done should support activity for some time. ", " The solid performance of business investment to date has been facilitated by continuing growth in the availability of finance. Credit to the business sector increased by 12 per cent over the year to March, which included a period of particularly rapid growth in the latter part of 1997. There are signs that this pace of credit expansion has been easing recently. However, borrowing by small businesses can be expected to receive a further boost from a recent round of reductions in small-business indicator rates by some major lenders (discussed in detail in the section on Financial Conditions below). The strong growth of business borrowing over the past year has been accompanied by an increasing volume of new equity raisings, encouraged by the strength of the share market. ", " Based on data up to the December quarter, farm output is likely to fall by close to 4 per cent in 1997/98, following record crop production in the previous year. This would bring the rural sector's share of total output to around 3½ per cent, which is around its average for the 1990s. Production has been affected by drought conditions in many parts of eastern Australia. Nonetheless, due to the fortunate timing of spring rainfall, the size of this year's wheat and barley crops turned out to be much higher than earlier anticipated. Moreover, recent rains across most of the farming areas have improved conditions for the planting of winter crops. ", " The persistence of dry conditions until recently saw cattle slaughterings maintained at a relatively high level. Meat production has therefore increased significantly over the past year, while the herd size has been reduced. Beef exports have correspondingly been very strong. Live cattle exports, which had been heavily dependent on sales to Indonesia, have, in contrast, fallen sharply in recent months. Conditions in the wool market have also deteriorated significantly since the onset of the Asian crisis. Demand from Korea and Japan, especially, has weakened. ", " Growth in exports was quite solid through most of 1997. Abstracting from one-off factors (such as the sale of gold from the Reserve Bank's holdings), the volume of exports of goods and services was unchanged in the December quarter, after strong growth in the September quarter, and was 8½ per cent higher than a year earlier. This is equal to the average annual rate of growth of exports during the 1990s. ", " By the end of the year, however, the early impact of the economic contraction in Asia was becoming apparent. Resource shipments continued to be strong, rising by 6 per cent in the December quarter to be more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> higher over the year, but exports of manufactured products and services declined in the quarter. Rural exports also fell, although this was only partly due to lower demand; lower farm production is also lessening the scope for growth in rural exports. ", " Early figures for 1998 show that export performance is being further hampered by the Asian crisis. Data need to be interpreted with caution, as exports usually fall in the early part of the calendar year, and figures for exports to individual countries are not available on a seasonally adjusted basis. It is quite clear, however, that exports to all of the troubled Asian economies have declined sharply in recent months (Graph 18) although, as noted below, some of this has been offset by greater strength elsewhere. Manufactured exports to the troubled Asian economies have declined by almost half over the past six months. To the extent that Australian-produced goods are for investment or consumption purposes, the contraction in demand within the Asian economies must be expected to be reflected in lower exports of these products. Rural exports are also weakening. The decline in service exports to the region is seen most clearly in a very large fall in the number of Asian tourists arriving in Australia at the end of 1997. The decline in resource commodity exports to the region has not been as sharp as those for manufactures or tourism. ", " There is some evidence of gains in other markets which are partly offsetting the losses in Asia. Table 6 shows growth in total merchandise exports by destination, over the year to the March quarter. While the decline in exports to troubled Asia is clear, growth in exports to the US, Europe and Japan has increased over the past year, though there must be a question whether, in the case of Japan, this can continue. Stronger export growth to these countries has been clearest for resources. For some manufactured goods, however, it is much more difficult to switch markets and this has been reflected in a slow pace of overall growth. The value of total ETM exports rose by about 2½ per cent over the four quarters to March which, although stronger than the result over the previous year, was well below average annual growth over the past decade of around 15 per cent. Visitor arrivals have weakened significantly over the past year, mainly due to a substantial decline in arrivals from <span class=\"no-wrap\">east Asia (Table 7)</span>. ", " Australian demand for imports remained strong through to the end of 1997, boosted by the strength in domestic spending. Import volumes grew by 12 per cent over the four quarters to December, (although this is also overstated to some extent by the treatment of computers – see <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>). More recent data suggest that growth in imports may have eased early in 1998, although demand has remained very strong for consumer goods imports, especially motor vehicles. Capital goods imports remain at a high level, consistent with strong investment in plant and equipment. ", " Australia's imports from the troubled Asian economies may increase during 1998 as these countries work to boost their exports. There is some evidence that imports from east Asia are growing faster than total imports, but that was true prior to the onset of the crisis in 1997, and probably reflects a longer-term trend towards greater economic integration with these countries. The recent strength in imports from the region has been concentrated in motor vehicles and gold which is processed for re-export. Gold exports from Korea and Thailand have increased substantially since the onset of the currency crisis. While this gold has boosted Australia's imports, it should have an equivalent effect on Australia's exports. ", " The current account deficit widened to 4.3 per cent of GDP – about the average for the past 15 years – in the December quarter (Graph 19). The balance of trade in goods and services moved from surplus to deficit during the December quarter, as export growth slowed and import growth remained strong. This widening continued in the March quarter, when the trade deficit totalled an estimated 1.7 per cent of GDP, compared with 0.3 per cent of GDP in the December quarter. ", " The net income deficit increased slightly in the December quarter to $5.3 billion. Net foreign liabilities stood at $321 billion (60 per cent of GDP), with net foreign debt at $222 billion (42 per cent of GDP). While the depreciation of the Australian dollar in the December quarter increased the value of net foreign debt by <span class=\"no-wrap\">$3.9 billion</span>, the lower exchange rate <em>reduced</em> the $A value of overall net foreign liabilities by $2.0 billion, as a significant proportion of foreign equity assets held by Australians is denominated in US dollars. ", " Measured in SDRs, commodity prices declined during the second half of 1997, but they have stabilised in recent months at a level around 9–10 per cent below that of the middle of 1997, just prior to the outbreak of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian crisis (Graph 20)</span>. The prices of both rural and resource products have weakened. Wool prices have continued to fall recently, with $A prices down 15 per cent since December. The prices of base metals, where the falls were greatest in late 1997, have been mostly unchanged since the start of 1998. New contract prices for bulk commodities came into effect in April. Coal prices declined by between 5 and 10 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollars</span> (although in Australian dollar terms they were higher than in contracts struck a year earlier). Contract prices for iron ore were lifted by 3 per cent in US dollar terms, with negotiations (which took place late in 1997) taking account of the strength of global demand, notwithstanding weakness in Japan and Korea. ", " In $A terms, it remains the case that overall commodity prices are slightly higher than they were a year ago, and are at about their average for the past five years. This is a result of the Australian dollar depreciating against the currencies of the major countries in the past six months or so. ", " Of considerable significance for the world economy, oil prices fell sharply early in 1998 as the Asian crisis and a mild northern winter highlighted the oversupply in the market. The price of West Texas crude fell to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$13 per barrel</span> in mid March before major oil-producing nations reached an agreement to cut supply. This has lifted prices by around US$3 per barrel. Nonetheless, prices remain quite low by historical standards. ", " Labour market conditions strengthened in response to the firmer trend in economic activity. There was a strong pick-up in employment in the second half of 1997 although monthly figures available so far in 1998 have shown a flatter trend (Graph 21). Over the year to March 1998, total employment increased by 1.5 per cent. Employment growth has been strongest in a number of private-sector service industries including property and business services, and in the construction industry, reflecting the upswing in housing and non-residential construction activity. As has been the case for some time, this strength has been partly offset by employment reductions in public administration and utilities, with employment in manufacturing also weak. ", " The stronger overall employment trend since mid 1997 brought about a decline in the unemployment rate. By December 1997, the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.2 per cent, around half a percentage point lower than its average in the first half of the year. Unemployment remained around this lower level over the first three months of 1998. ", " Employment growth over the recent period has been weighted towards full-time jobs (Graph 22). Since the middle of 1997, full-time employment has increased at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent, compared with a rate of increase of 0.9 per cent in the part-time component. This means that, on a full-time equivalents basis, the pick-up in labour demand in the recent period has been slightly stronger than implied by the increase in the total number employed. This pattern is not unusual when a cyclical pick-up in employment occurs: full-time employment has generally shown a relatively high degree of sensitivity to short-term variations in economic activity, a fact which also accounts for the relative weakness of full-time employment during 1996. This cyclical pattern has occurred alongside the structural shift towards an increasing share of part-time employment evident over the longer term. ", " While the labour market clearly strengthened in the second half of 1997, it is unclear how much of that strength has carried forward into the early months of 1998. Taking the labour force data at face value, there was no further increase in total employment between December and March, although there was some continuation of the shift towards full-time employment referred to above. Matched-sample estimates of employment, which can be useful in analysing short-term changes, suggest a decline in employment over recent months. Given the volatility of the monthly data, it is difficult to assess whether these weaker results represent a significant slowing in the underlying trend. It would be surprising if the trend towards higher employment were to weaken so soon. Growth in output in 1997 was, by any historical experience, quite strong enough to generate good growth in employment. Productivity growth through the year outstripped the impressively high average for this expansion by a considerable margin; it would be highly unusual for such strength in productivity growth to be sustained for long. These factors would normally be enough to generate employment gains for some time, even if output growth is easing back. ", " One factor that might be thought to be contributing to a weakening of demand for labour at the moment is the impact of the Asian crisis. There have been declines in employment in two industries – accommodation and recreation – likely to have been affected by reduced tourist arrivals over recent months. However, the total of these declines is quite small (a reduction of 3,000 over the past six months). Business surveys show little evidence of a change in employment behaviour in recent months at an economy-wide level, or of a significant change in near-term hiring intentions. Moreover, job vacancies have continued to increase. The ANZ measure of job vacancies has continued to edge higher, while the ABS measure shows private-sector vacancies 25 per cent higher than a year ago, following a 15 per cent increase in the three months to February (Graph 23). Both measures are at levels that in the past have been consistent with a good pace of job creation. ", " As noted earlier, since July 1997, the cash rate has been steady at 5 per cent, a level just above its trough of 1993/94. The effects of cash-rate reductions over the past two years have been reinforced by a widespread compression of interest margins of financial intermediaries, with the result that, in many cases, interest rates faced by borrowers have fallen below their earlier troughs. The most recent example of this process was a round of reductions in indicator rates for small businesses in recent months, discussed in detail below and in <a href=\"#box-e\">Box E</a>. ", " Signs of competition in <em>small business</em> finance have increased over the past six months, with a range of products now available at indicator interest rates well below the predominant indicator rate available six months ago. The latest statistics on the average overall interest rate on small business variable-rate loans – which incorporate customer risk margins as well as the indicator rate – also show noticeable reductions, by more than can be explained by the easing of monetary policy in recent years. In December 1997 (the latest statistics available), the average overall interest rate on variable-rate loans to small business was 9.4 per cent, down from 12.6 per cent in the June quarter 1996 at the beginning of the phase of easing in monetary policy. As a result, the margin over the cash rate has narrowed by 0.7 of a percentage point. A major factor in this was the introduction in 1997 of new loan products, such as residential-secured overdrafts and term loans at interest rates well below the standard indicator rate. ", " This process of offering a wider range of products at discounted rates has continued in 1998, with the result that indicator rates on most small business loan products are now in the range of 6.8–7.5 per cent, the lowest rates available since at least 1965 (Graph 24). ", " Indicator rates on variable-rate loans for <em>large businesses</em> have clustered around 8.5 per cent since the reduction in cash rates in July 1997, although one bank has recently reduced its indicator rate in line with the falls in its small business rates. However, the weighted-average of variable-rate loans to large business has declined from <span class=\"no-wrap\">10.6 per cent</span> in mid 1996 to 7.8 per cent in December 1997, suggesting some discounting to advertised rates. Creditworthy corporate customers typically pay only a slight margin over funds raised in wholesale markets, such as bank bills. The growing tendency for corporates to approach the market directly, as discussed in <a href=\"#box-f\">Box F</a>, is increasing competitive pressures on banks and operating to keep these margins fine. ", " The standard interest rate banks charge on variable-rate <em>housing</em> loans has remained steady at 6.7 per cent since August 1997. The margin to the cash rate has also remained unchanged at 1.7 percentage points; this follows the phase between May 1996 and February 1997 when pressure of competition, mainly from mortgage managers, saw this spread contract from 3.0 percentage points above the cash rate. Banks continue to offer <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘basic’</span> or ‘no frills’ products at a rate of around 6.2 per cent, slightly below rates offered by mortgage managers. Interest rates charged by mortgage managers have remained steady at around 6.4 per cent. ", " Interest rates on fixed-rate housing loans have continued to fall, reflecting lower funding costs in capital markets. The average rate on new loans for terms fixed for three years is currently about 6.8 per cent, a fall of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 basis points</span> since the easing of monetary policy last July, broadly in line with the fall in funding costs in the same period. ", " The effect of competition on the market shares of banks and mortgage managers has become clearer (see <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 25)</span>. Between 1994 and mid 1996, banks lost market share as mortgage managers undercut them on interest rates. The cuts in banks' mortgage rates over and above the reductions in the cash rate had the effect of stabilising banks' market share at around 83 per cent of total new loans, down from 90 per cent earlier in the 1990s. However, the decision by banks to refrain from passing on all of the reduction in the cash rate announced in May 1997 saw mortgage managers' share of new loans rise by a further 4 percentage points, ground that banks have not fully recovered. ", " Margins on personal lending remain higher than on housing and business lending. Some banks have reduced interest rates on selected retail products, both secured and unsecured, in April and May. With margins on housing and small business loans having narrowed, competition by banks for personal loans, which has recently been the fastest growing sector, might also be beginning to intensify. To date, however, these reductions have been confined to some banks and selected, if mainstream, products. ", " Real interest rates, on a variety of measures, have continued to decline over the past three to four years.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Although there is no single definitive real interest rate measure (since real interest rates depend on inflation expectations which are not directly observable), it is reasonable to conclude that real interest rates have fallen by slightly less than nominal rates in recent years, since most indicators of inflation expectations have been declining. Two measures presented in Table 8 suggest that the real cash rate is currently slightly below its average of the past five years. While there is no precise benchmark as to whether that constitutes an expansionary setting, it can be noted that this has been a period of above-average growth for the economy and particularly private sector spending. ", " Real interest rates faced by borrowers have declined more substantially than real cash rates, as a result of the reductions in intermediaries' interest margins discussed earlier. On the basis of the same two definitions used above, real interest rates on loans from intermediaries have fallen well below their averages of the past five years. For housing and small business loans, these are now below their previous cyclical troughs. ", " Interest-rate settings have proved consistent with strong growth in private expenditure during the past year and with a pick-up in the rate of growth of financial intermediaries' credit (Table 9). Over the year to March 1998, intermediaries' credit to the private non-financial sector increased by just under 12 per cent, up from a rate of just under 10 per cent a year earlier. There were some signs, however, that the rate of credit expansion may have begun to ease a little in the early months of 1998. ", " The composition of credit growth has changed markedly over the past year (Graph 26). There was a pronounced strengthening in the rate of growth of personal credit in the second half of 1997. Much of this growth can be traced to growth in revolving credit in the form of overdrafts and credit-card lending; it also partly reflects strong growth in motor-vehicle financing. The Telstra share offer in October and November probably accentuated the trend: there was a pick-up in loan approvals for personal investment, and the need for additional liquidity by households subscribing to the offer may have contributed to greater demand for other forms of credit. More generally, the increased use of personal credit was related to the strength of consumer spending over the second half of the year. ", " Credit to businesses also showed a strong pick-up in the second half of 1997, increasing at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">15.5 per cent</span> over the six months to December, although it has eased considerably in the early months of 1998. New business loan approvals remain around record levels, but appear to have reached a plateau in recent months. Business loan approvals in the past six months have been strongest in the property, wholesale and, to a lesser extent, manufacturing sectors. ", " In contrast to the other components, the volume of housing credit outstanding has grown at a relatively stable rate during the past year, increasing by 10.8 per cent over the year to March. Much of the growth in housing credit has been concentrated in lending to investors. While new lending commitments for owner-occupiers have been increasing relatively strongly in the current housing upswing, there has been a tendency for existing loans to be paid off more quickly as interest rates have fallen, thus holding down the overall growth in the volume of owner-occupier loans outstanding. ", " Unusually for a period of strong growth in aggregate credit, there has been a significant decline in the rate of growth of monetary assets held by the community. The stock of broad money, which consists mainly of deposits with financial intermediaries, increased by 6.7 per cent over the year to March, well down from the rates of around 10 per cent a year ago (Graph 27). With deposits growing more slowly, the expansion of credit by financial intermediaries has been partly funded by increased capital market raisings, by reductions in holdings of government securities, and by increased use of external borrowing. Offshore borrowing by financial intermediaries has been growing at annual rates of around 20 per cent for the past two years. ", " Total household financial assets, however, have continued to expand more quickly than incomes, rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over the year to December 1997. The increase in household financial assets was concentrated in holdings of equities, both directly and through superannuation funds. Continuing a trend that has been evident for some time, growth in holdings of deposits with traditional financial intermediaries has been outpaced by growth in managed investments. The fastest-growing component of this has been cash management trusts, where assets over the past year have increased by 40 per cent (Table 10). Rapid growth of these funds has reflected the interest-rate advantage that they offer relative to traditional bank deposit products, as well as their increasing ability to offer transactions facilities such as cheque-writing that compete with the services provided by banks. There has also been strong growth in assets of unit trusts and, to a lesser extent, superannuation funds. Life office and superannuation fund investments remain the largest component of household financial wealth, comprising about half of the total. Direct household holdings of equities were boosted substantially by the Telstra float in the December quarter, and will be further boosted by the issue of AMP shares to policyholders in 1998. The overall growth in households' net financial wealth in 1997 was faster than it had been for some years. ", " The consumer price index in underlying terms increased by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter and by 1.5 per cent over the year (Graph 28). The March quarter increase followed three successive quarterly rises of 0.3 per cent, with the pick-up from that level partly attributable to the contribution from import prices, as explained in detail below. ", " The movement in the headline CPI over the past year has been held down to a significant degree by mortgage interest rate reductions and, more recently, by declining petrol prices. In the March quarter, the CPI rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span>, but fell by 0.2 per cent over the year to March. Mortgage interest reductions detracted <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.3 percentage points</span> from the change in the index over the year, with most of the effect concentrated in the June and September quarters. ", " Import prices have played a significant role in recent inflation movements. For much of the past two years, the imported-goods component of the CPI has been falling, and has therefore contributed to the containment of overall inflationary pressures. Over the year to the December quarter 1997, this component declined by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.6 per cent</span>, including a fall of over 1 per cent in the December quarter. In large part, these price declines reflected the gradual pass-through of earlier appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate during 1996 and early 1997. Subsequent depreciation of the currency has meant that the direction of the impetus from import prices is now being reversed. In the March quarter, the imported-goods component of the CPI rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span>, its first quarterly increase for around two years. The rates of increase in prices of domestically produced goods and services in the CPI have continued to decline (Graph 29). ", " The effects of exchange-rate movements typically work in two stages – their initial effect on import prices across the docks, and their final, more gradual, impact on retail prices. The first stage of this pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation was clearly evident with large increases in import prices across the docks in both the December and March quarters. Wholesale import prices increased by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.7 per cent</span> over the year. Excluding oil prices, which have been declining substantially, the rise over the year was 9 per cent. ", " The size of this first-stage impact on import prices to date has been somewhat larger in relation to the change in the import-weighted exchange rate than might have been expected from historical comparisons. This seems to reflect a tendency for export prices of the troubled Asian economies to fall by less, in terms of the major world currencies, than the amount of their currency depreciations. That is, exporters have taken the opportunity to increase prices in terms of their domestic currencies. From the point of view of the exporters, this makes sense: they need to rebuild profit margins and do not need to cut prices much in foreign-currency terms to be sufficiently competitive to increase sales. A consequence of this behaviour is that exchange-rate movements of the sharply depreciating Asian currencies are likely to overstate the price reductions available to consumers of their exports. ", " One factor helping to mitigate the rise in import prices is the absence of any inflationary pressure in the major industrial countries. In most OECD countries, inflation rates have been declining in recent years, to be at levels mainly between 0 and 3 per cent (Table 11). In the United States, as noted earlier, this has reflected a combination of unusually strong productivity growth, lower energy prices and a rising trade-weighted exchange rate. In continental Europe and Japan, the continued presence of surplus capacity has helped to hold down inflation. A consequence of these low inflation rates is that pr ices of internationally traded goods, which tend to rise less quickly than non-traded goods and services prices, have been flat or slightly declining in recent years in terms of the major currencies. ", "   As illustrated in Graph 30, the second stage of pass-through into imported consumer goods is typically quite gradual. Nonetheless, the rise in across-the-docks prices that has already occurred sets the stage for rising import prices at the consumer level in the period ahead, after a lengthy period when these had been falling. ", "   Producer prices generally recorded modest increases in the March quarter, with the exception of raw materials prices which declined, mainly reflecting falls in oil prices (Table 12). The strongest producer-price increases recently have been for house-building materials, which were up by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.2 per cent over the year. This has probably reflected stronger demand in the building industry, although increases in non-residential building materials prices have lately tended to ease. The rate of increase in manufacturers' output prices has shown some tendency to drift upward over the past year but, at 1.7 per cent, the annual increase at this stage remains moderate. Some additional upward pressure on manufacturers' prices may come from costs of imported inputs: following the exchange rate depreciation, these are now rising more quickly. Working the other way, lower oil prices, if they are sustained, will reduce production costs. ", "   Average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) increased by 1.3 per cent in the three months to February and by 3.9 per cent over the past year (Graph 31). Both the quarterly and annual figures have fluctuated markedly but, in annual terms, the rate of increase has come down slightly from a rate of 4.3 per cent a year ago, and from a cyclical peak of over 5 per cent. Over the six months to February, the annualised rate of increase was <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span>. ", " For much of the recent period, the recorded rate of earnings growth has been affected by an apparent divergence between the public and private sectors, with public-sector earnings growing substantially more quickly. This divergence was at its greatest extent a year ago, and has since been largely eliminated by a pronounced slowing in recorded public-sector earnings growth along with a somewhat smaller pick-up in the private sector component. Interpretation of short-run developments in these indicators is hampered by data volatility and by the possible effects of compositional change, particularly in the public-sector workforce. In broad terms, however, the data suggest that both private-sector and economy-wide wages are probably now growing at a bit under <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. ", " An alternative reading on the pace of aggregate wage increases will be provided over time by the newly developed <em>wage cost index</em>. This index is designed as a measure of hourly wage rates at the level of individual jobs of a given quality and, in principle, it should be less affected by compositional change or changes in average hours than is the case for measures based on weekly earnings. Some track record of experience will be needed to allow the performance of this index to be assessed. At this stage, only one reading on the aggregate quarterly change is available – an increase of 0.8 per cent in the December quarter – which seems broadly consistent with the earlier conclusion that wages are rising at an annual rate of less than 4 per cent. ", " Developments in enterprise bargaining suggest an easing in the pace of negotiated wage increases recently. In the December quarter, new federal enterprise agreements yielded average annualised wage increases of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.1 per cent</span>, down from a prevailing average of around 4½ per cent over much of the past two years <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 32)</span>. The decline has been most pronounced in the private sector, where new agreements in the December quarter were for average increases of 3.8 per cent, down from a peak of over 5 per cent in 1996. Wage increases in the manufacturing sector have come down noticeably, although they continue to be well above the private-sector average. While the quarterly results for new wage agreements can be affected by the composition of industries in which agreements are being struck, an examination of <em>renegotiated agreements</em> confirms a tendency for the pace of wage increases to ease. Private-sector agreements renegotiated in the December quarter yielded average increases of 3.5 per cent, compared with average increases of 5.1 per cent under the agreements they replaced (Graph 33), and early indications are that this trend towards lower settlements has continued in 1998. ", " An easing of wage pressures under enterprise bargaining is to be expected given the further declines in inflation and inflation expectations that have taken place, the pressure on corporate profitability, and the continued existence of a degree of slack in the labour market. In addition to these factors, it is possible that there is some re-assessment occurring as to the rate of wage increases that is sustainable in a low-inflation environment. In the initial adjustment to the widespread adoption of enterprise bargaining, wage expectations were unrealistically high, with settlements averaging more than 5 per cent. To the extent that excessive wage increases put pressure on profitability and employment, this may have led participants to lower their expectations, contributing to the lower increases recorded recently under renegotiated agreements. ", " The outcome of the Safety-Net Review, announced by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in late April, will determine increases in award wages in the year ahead for employees not covered by enterprise agreements. The Commission awarded a three-tier increase ranging between $10 and $14 a week, depending on income, with the largest increases going to those on the lowest award rates of pay. This represents a slightly larger average increase than was awarded the previous year. ", " In contrast to indicators of enterprise bargaining outcomes and award wage increases, the growth of executive salaries remains at a high level. Results of the Cullen Egan and Dell survey of executive remuneration suggest that they continue to grow at annual rates of around 6 per cent, about the same rate that has prevailed for the past two years, and do not appear to have been affected by the recent declines in corporate profitability. ", " Most measures of inflation expectations have declined substantially over the past two years, particularly in late 1996 and into 1997. Reduced expectations of inflation probably reflected a wider general recognition of the low-inflation environment in place since the early 1990s, as well as the declines in actual inflation occurring over the recent period. In the past few months, some measures of inflation expectations have moved up a little, possibly reflecting the expected impact of the recent exchange-rate depreciation, but they remain close to historical lows. ", " Consumers' expectations of annual inflation, as recorded by the Melbourne Institute survey, stood at 3.4 per cent in April, close to the average since the sharp downward movement in this series in the second half of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1996 (Graph 34)</span>. In the past few months, expectations have picked up a little from the trough of just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> recorded in November 1997. Volatility in the survey is such that it is usually difficult to attribute movements of this size to particular events, but the timing of the recent increase suggests it may have been influenced by the weaker exchange rate. As has been the case throughout the history of the survey, consumers' inflation expectations are recorded as being somewhat higher than actual inflation rates. Survey results broken down by occupational categories point to some significant variations across these groups. Expectations of those broadly classed as professionals have generally been lower over the past two to three years, and have declined more, than those of the population average. ", " Business surveys of inflation expectations are giving mixed results at present. Firms responding to the NAB survey expect to raise their prices by 0.5 per cent in the June quarter, a slight increase on the previous quarter's expectations. Retail price setters expect to increase prices by 0.4 per cent, the same as for the previous quarter. The ACCI-Westpac survey presents a weaker picture. A sizeable net balance of respondents reported falling selling prices in the March quarter, with a majority also expecting prices to fall in the June quarter. The different patterns across the two surveys may reflect their differences in coverage, with manufacturers covered by the ACCI-Westpac survey possibly having greater exposure to competition from countries whose exchange rates have recently depreciated. ", " Firms' longer-run inflation expectations have remained steady. According to the NAB survey, a large majority of business respondents continue to expect average inflation over the next 10 years to be below 4 per cent, with the most common expectation in the 3 to 4 per cent range. Long-term expectations implied by financial market prices are considerably lower. As noted earlier, the 10-year inflation expectation implied by yield differentials between indexed and conventional bonds is currently around 2 per cent. ", " Inflation trends in the near term will reflect contrasting influences of domestic factors and developments in import prices. Domestic cost and price pressures, at present, appear well contained. Import prices, however, will deliver a positive impetus to inflation over the next one to two years, as the impact of Australia's recent currency depreciation flows through to consumer prices. Much of the first stage of the impact of the lower exchange rate has already occurred, with across-the-docks import prices rising by 9 per cent over the past year. ", " These developments in import prices are occurring alongside a steadier trend in domestic costs and prices. In general, these are rising at quite moderate rates. As noted earlier, there have been some signs of a modest slowing in wage costs in some areas, and aggregate wages can be characterised at an economy-wide level as growing at a little under 4 per cent. With trend labour productivity growth of around 1¾ per cent since the start of the current expansion, this rate of increase is consistent with longer-run achievement of the inflation target, although further slowing of wage growth would still be beneficial for employment prospects. ", " The pace of increases in private-sector service prices has declined over the past two years, although it remains relatively high at 3.2 per cent. The domestically produced goods component of the CPI increased by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span> over the past year, having slowed gradually during the past three years from a peak of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. Falling oil prices have contributed to this decline. To some extent, it also reflects the restraining influence of competition from imported goods: this price discipline will be lessened in the period ahead as import prices rise. Domestic producer-price increases have picked up a bit recently, although the rates of increase remain very low. ", " Reflecting the impact of rising import prices, the Bank's expectation is that inflation will rise to around 2 per cent by the end of 1998 and to around 2½ per cent by the middle of 1999. Risks exist in both directions around this central forecast. A somewhat higher inflation outcome could be envisaged if the exchange rate were to decline further from its recent levels, or if the exchange rate decline that has already occurred were to generate a pick-up in domestic wage and price increases and higher inflation expectations. This latter risk would be more likely to eventuate in circumstances where the economy was growing more strongly than expected. Somewhat lower inflation might arise in the medium term if the reductions in inflation and inflation expectations over the recent period, coupled with the expected slowing in economic growth, were to lead to a significant step down in the pace of growth in labour costs. ", " One of the key functions of the IMF is to provide financial assistance to member countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties. This role has been prominent over the past year as a result of the large-scale assistance provided to Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. The attention given to these support packages has tended to obscure the fact that financing of this sort is an ongoing function of the IMF – many facilities, both large and small, are offered during the course of an average year. A broad overview of these activities is provided below in order to place the recent Asian facilities in perspective. ", " Reflecting the varied nature of circumstances and problems facing its 182 member countries, the IMF has a number of different facilities available for dealing with balance of payments needs. Each differs in terms of the size of the facility, the period over which it can be drawn upon, and the repayment period once drawn. The main facilities are: Stand-by Arrangements, Extended Fund Facilities, and the newly created Supplemental Reserve Facility. ", " Stand-by Arrangements and Extended Fund Facilities are used for overcoming balance of payments difficulties stemming from short and longer term problems, respectively. The Supplemental Reserve Facility was introduced late last year and is aimed at addressing situations where a country is facing large short-term capital outflows, in particular where such outflows have the potential to trigger contagion. It provides short-term funding in excess of that available under other facilities, but at a higher rate of interest. ", " In addition to the Fund's regular facilities, there are a number of special facilities available for countries facing particular circumstances, such as temporary shortfalls in export earnings, and concessional facilities for low-income member countries facing protracted balance of payments problems. ", " Graph A1 shows the number of financing facilities <em>approved</em> by the Fund each year. They have generally fluctuated between 20 and 30 per annum in this decade. In the past year, the number of new facilities has been smaller than this, but the size of those facilities has been large by historical standards, with the result that the overall value of new IMF commitments has been the largest ever, at around US$40 billion <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph A2)</span>. Approvals in 1995 and 1996 were also quite high, largely because of the very large size of the facilities provided to Mexico and Russia. ", " It should be noted that the IMF has not been the only contributor to the support packages for these countries; other international bodies and individual countries contributed around US$30 billion to the 1995 Mexican package and have signed up for US$13 billion to the Thai package, US$37 billion for the Korean package and US$25 billion for the Indonesian package. Not all this has been drawn, and some of the bilateral funds promised may never be drawn. Details of the various packages are shown in Table A1. ", " Graphs A3 and A4 place the events of the past couple of years in a longer historical context. While the past few years clearly stand out, so do the early 1980s. In fact, if scaled against developed world GDP, assistance provided directly by the IMF in the early 1980s was similar to the recent period. The latter part of the surge in Fund commitments in the early 1980s reflects the Latin American debt crisis, while the earlier years reflect facilities for a wide range of countries, particularly India, Yugoslavia, Turkey and Pakistan. ", " A point of interest is that the Asian crisis has resulted in an historic shift in the geographical focus of IMF assistance. As Graph A5 shows, 1997 marks the first year in which Asia has drawn substantially on Fund resources. Traditionally, the Americas and Europe have been the main users of Fund resources, with Europe's share increasing steadily over the course of the 1990s following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Asia made a modest call on funds in the early 1990s, largely through India, Pakistan and the Philippines. ", " The partial privatisation of Telstra in November 1997 and demutualisation of the AMP Society are the largest financial-sector events of their kind to have occurred in Australia (Table B1). Both are likely to have significant effects on the real economy. The Telstra privatisation probably had a small positive effect on consumer demand in the December 1997 and March 1998 quarters, while the AMP demutualisation may have a somewhat larger effect during 1998 and 1999. ", " The sale of one-third of Telstra will yield around $14.3 billion to the Commonwealth. Households were allocated 60 per cent of Telstra shares on offer. The remaining shares were purchased, in about equal proportions, by domestic and foreign institutional investors. The persistent strength in the price of Telstra instalment-receipts<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> (IRs) since their listing on 17 November reflects strong demand from institutions seeking to hold share portfolios that mirror the composition of the All Ordinaries index, which now includes one-third of Telstra. It also reflects an international re-rating of telecommunications stocks associated with a flight to quality following the Asian financial crisis. The possibility that the utility will be fully privatised after the next federal election may also have underpinned demand for IRs. ", " Households may have <em>reduced</em> consumption initially to help fund the purchase of Telstra IRs, although many of the purchases were financed by borrowings. Households who purchased IRs, however, have experienced a substantial capital gain as IRs have traded at a premium of 100 per cent to the issue price. This is likely to have led to a more recent <em>boost</em> to consumption both from retail investors who have sold their IRs in recent months, and from investors spending some of the added wealth implicit in the higher price of their IRs. Part of the approximately $900 million oversubscription money returned to retail investors in early December may also have been spent, especially given the proximity of these receipts to Christmas. ", " The demutualisation of the AMP Society earlier this year gives current policyholders a readily transferable share of the wealth that has accumulated in the AMP since its inception. Current estimates suggest that when the renamed AMP Ltd lists on the stock exchange on 15 June, its market capitalisation will be in the range $13½ – $17½ billion. Most policyholders are likely to have ignored, or heavily discounted, this component of their wealth before the demutualisation was mooted. In this sense, the demutualisation may be seen as a ‘windfall gain’ by current policyholders. ", " Australians are estimated to be entitled to around 75 per cent of the AMP Ltd shares, with most of the remainder going to citizens of New Zealand and the UK. Of the Australian shares, about 10 per cent will be allocated to superannuation trustees. Based on these estimates, individual Australian policyholders will be allocated about two-thirds of the AMP shares on offer. These individual policyholders are likely to increase their spending on consumption and dwelling investment, based on the experience in the United Kingdom following the conversion of building societies and the demutualisation of insurance companies in 1997. ", " The increase in spending is likely to come from two types of policyholders. The first type are those who sell AMP shares and spend some of the proceeds. (Some of these policyholders might be unable to increase current spending without selling AMP shares, because they lack a buffer of savings.) The UK experience suggests that the additional expenditure from policyholders who sell shares could amount to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">$1.3 billion</span> in the two years following the demutualisation, using the midpoint of current estimates of market capitalisation, with most of this expenditure occurring this year. The second type of policyholders are those who keep their AMP shares (at least for several months after the listing), but who nevertheless have sufficient savings to increase current expenditure. These policyholders might be expected to raise their expenditure in response to the ‘windfall gain’ implicit in the AMP demutualisation. Some of this extra expenditure (about $0.3 billion, based on the UK experience) may occur <em>in anticipation</em> of the receipt of AMP shares. A continued flow of additional expenditure should also be expected by these policyholders after the shares have been received, which might add an estimated $0.6 billion per annum to expenditure. ", " The survey evidence from the UK, on which these estimates are based, needs to be applied with caution to the Australian experience, because the payouts in the UK were derived from a range of financial market events, albeit dominated by demutualisations, and occurred in a period of robust consumer confidence and consumption growth. In addition, the age profile of members of building societies and policyholders of insurance companies in the UK may have been different from that of the individual policyholders of AMP Ltd; spending patterns in response to windfall gains may well differ by age group. Despite these caveats, the AMP demutualisation may be expected to boost aggregate demand in Australia in 1998 and into 1999 by the order of a few tenths of one per cent of annual GDP, with most of this effect in the current year. ", " The current housing upswing has, on occasion, been characterised as relatively weak, because the increase in the number of dwellings constructed has been smaller than at a comparable stage of earlier cycles. This characterisation is misleading, however, because the current cycle has witnessed an unusually high level of activity in alterations and additions to existing dwellings and a rising average value of the dwellings being built. As a result, the amount of investment activity in the current cycle, as opposed to the <em>number</em> of dwellings being built, has been similar to that in earlier cycles. The current cycle also differs from earlier cycles in the type of dwellings being built and in geographical composition. A higher than usual proportion of medium-density dwellings (as opposed to free-standing houses) has been built and construction activity has been unusually concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria. In part, this geographical concentration of activity reflects shifting patterns of interstate migration. ", " Graph C1 illustrates the current and past recoveries in the number of private building approvals, divided into two components: houses and medium-density dwellings. The relative weakness in the total number of building approvals compared to previous cycles reflects a slower-than-average pick-up in the houses component. By contrast, the number of approvals for medium-density dwellings has been quite similar to earlier cycles. ", " The smaller total number of building approvals has not translated into weaker dwelling <span class=\"no-wrap\">investment (Graph C2)</span>. One reason for this is that alterations and additions activity has been relatively robust in the early stages of the cycle. Three years after the latest peak in dwelling activity, investment in the construction of new dwellings was still 7 per cent below its previous peak, while the amount of alterations and additions activity had regained its previous peak. The second reason is that the average value of the dwellings being constructed has risen over the past 4 years by more than 15 per cent after allowing for changes in the price of building materials, reflecting an increase in the average size and quality of the dwellings being constructed. ", " The current pick-up has been heavily concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria. Together, these States have accounted for almost all the growth in the number of dwellings in the current cycle, compared with less than half in the previous cycle. The number of dwellings being built in New South Wales in this cycle has not been unusually large. The cycle in Victoria does stand out, however, particularly for medium-density dwellings, which had been especially weak in the two previous housing upturns (Graph C3). ", " Building approvals in most of the other States have hardly grown at all thus far in the current housing cycle. In Queensland, there has been a modest upturn, but so far it is much weaker than in the early 1990s cycle. ", " The differing fortunes of Victoria and Queensland seem due in part to shifts in the pattern of interstate migration. To a large extent, dwelling investment is driven by the rate of population growth, and large flows of migrants into Queensland in 1993 and 1994 resulted in particularly strong housing investment at that <span class=\"no-wrap\">time (Graph C4)</span>. Since then, migration has fallen markedly, leading to a concomitant fall in demand for housing. ", " Many of the people who migrated to Queensland came from Victoria, a pattern which is consistent with weak economic activity in Victoria and robust growth in Queensland in the early 1990s. There is some evidence that these people came disproportionately from socio-demographic groups which traditionally favour medium-density dwellings, such as the elderly and less-wealthy households. This pattern of migration flows from Victoria helps to explain the weakness of medium-density activity in Victoria in the previous cycle as well as its more recent strength. ", " The concentration of activity in New South Wales and Victoria may also help to explain why the average real value of new dwellings has risen in the current housing cycle. Dwellings built in New South Wales and Victoria are more expensive on average than those built in Queensland and the rest of Australia. It is also true, however, that the average real value of dwellings being built in each state is rising. This development reflects lower nominal interest rates (permitting households to obtain larger loans) and rising levels of real income and wealth. ", " In the September quarter National Accounts, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will be changing the methodology it uses to derive estimates of the quantity of output and its components. Annually chained estimates will replace the present set of constant price estimates. The new estimates should provide a more accurate assessment of the composition of growth in the economy and relative price movements. To preview these changes, an experimental set of annually chained quantity estimates for GDP(E) and its components were published in March in an information paper.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " Noticeable differences between the new chained estimates and the presently published numbers arise when there have been significant changes in the relative prices or quantities of different goods and services demanded or supplied in the economy. Such changes lead to a divergence between price and quantity indices calculated using different methods, such as between base-period-weighted (Laspeyres) and <span class=\"no-wrap\">current-period-weighted (Paasche)</span> indices. In a situation in which these divergences are large, frequently re-weighted chained measures provide a better summary of developments.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"r4\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> ", " Graph D1 illustrates that the annually chained and present estimates provide a very similar picture for the expenditure measure of GDP. Over the 7 years to December 1997, these measures imply that growth has averaged 3.5 and 3.3 per cent, respectively, though in some periods estimates of quarterly and year-ended growth differ on account of temporary movements in relative prices. ", " The generally similar aggregate outcomes for GDP(E) in the two sets of estimates reflect some significant but offsetting differences at the level of individual expenditure components. The principle source of these differences is the substantial fall in the relative price of computers that has taken place since the base year: computer prices in relative terms have fallen by about 80 per cent since 1989/90. This means that since 1989/90, the present fixed-weighted quantity indices of expenditure components, which do not take this relative price fall into account, are increasingly giving too high a weight to computers. Since spending on computers is growing faster than other areas of spending, this biases upward the estimated growth in any category of spending in which computers form a significant part. In particular, growth in the quantity of equipment investment, imports and (to a lesser extent) consumption have all been overstated. Since computers are largely imported, these effects are largely offsetting between categories of domestic output and there is little effect on GDP. ", " Graph D2 shows two measures of both real private investment and real imports. In each case, the higher measure is derived using 1989/90 prices, and is the series presently published by the ABS. The second measure is the annually chained estimate. Comparing these measures suggests that, over the past couple of years, the presently published data have overstated annual growth in real equipment investment by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 percentage points</span>, and hence private final demand by around <img src=\"images/equation-0598-2-01.gif\" alt=\"image\"> of a percentage point. The overstatement of real import growth, by around 2½ percentage points, has largely offset this bias, leaving the level of total output little affected. ", " The counterpart to these findings is that the present implicit price deflators for equipment investment and imports have been understating the ‘true’ growth in these prices in recent years. And, as a consequence, presently published estimates of the terms of trade have been misleading. Graph D3 shows that estimates of the terms of trade based on the annually chained data are somewhat lower than the presently published estimates, especially during the past few years. Again, the main reason for this is that the traditional terms of trade measure has, in recent years, effectively given increasing weight to computer prices. Given that computers are mainly imported and that their prices are falling, this leads to an increasing upward bias in the terms of trade measured on the present basis. ", " The tentative signs of increased competition in small business finance that were evident six months ago have become clearer in the period since. In particular, banks have started cutting interest rates on mainstream lending products, such as overdraft facilities, and the average all-up interest rate paid by small businesses (including customer risk margins) has fallen significantly even though monetary policy has not been changed. ", " As noted in the material provided in the lead-up to the Bank's previous appearance before the Committee, signs of increased competition in the small business loan market began to emerge following the reduction in banks' housing loan margins in 1996 and early 1997. Initially, competition for small business loans took the form of products at discounted interest rates aimed at new customers. These developments had some parallels to the way competition in the housing loan market first appeared. But, as was the case for housing loans, competition eventually spread to mainstream small business products. In early 1997, major banks announced new residential-secured products, either as overdraft or term loans, at interest rates of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½–2 percentage points</span> below the standard overdraft indicator rate, and without a customer risk margin. ", " In recent months most of the major banks have announced reductions in overdraft indicator interest rates of between 1 and 1.8 percentage points. In some cases, a fixed margin applies above these indicator rates according to collateral and whether the facility is a term loan or overdraft. While there is no single predominant rate, indicator rates on small business variable-rate loans from major banks are now concentrated around 7 per cent, the lowest indicator rate offered on a ‘widely available’ product by a major bank since the early 1960s. Previously, all the major banks had been advertising indicator rates of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.75 per cent</span> or a little more for all but residentially secured lending (Table E1). Before the easings of monetary policy in mid 1996, the major banks' overdraft products were based uniformly on an indicator rate of 11.25 per cent. ", " The recent announcements by banks have reinforced a trend towards giving greater recognition to the type of security offered for loans. This tiering of interest rates according to security offered reflects the spectrum of risk in business lending if the need arises to liquidate collateral in the event of business default. ", " The effects of growing competitive pressure will show up over time in further falls in the average interest rate paid by small businesses. These data, which cover the all-up interest rate paid by small business – i.e. indicator rates plus customer risk margins – are collected by the Bank on a quarterly basis. The latest figures available are for the December quarter. Whereas in the couple of years to mid 1997 there had been little change in this rate apart from that due to changes in monetary policy, in the period since then it has fallen significantly. The average overall interest rate paid by small businesses on variable rate loans was 9.4 per cent in the December quarter, down from 10.6 per cent six months earlier. This reduction reflected, to an important extent, the new lower-priced products introduced in 1997. Obviously, the more recently announced reductions in overdraft rates referred to above have not yet been reflected in these figures. ", " These reductions have meant that the margin between the rate banks charge customers and their funding costs has narrowed (Table E2). In the case of variable-rate loans, banks' funding costs can be approximated by the cash rate. The margin between the indicator rate on a standard overdraft and the cash rate had been mostly around 3.75 percentage points over 1996 and 1997; the average margin for major banks is now 2.7 per cent. The margins for residential-secured <em>overdrafts</em> and <em>term</em> loans are now 2.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively. ", " Measured across all variable-rate products, and after taking into account customer risk margins, the total interest rate paid by small business fell to 4.4 percentage points above cash in the December quarter 1997, after having been fairly steady at around 5 per cent over the period to mid 1997. ", " As the recently announced reductions in interest rates come into the figures, it might be expected that this margin will narrow further. It seems unlikely, however, that small business margins overall will fall to the same extent as those on owner-occupied housing because small business lending is, on the whole, more risky than lending for housing. While, as noted in the past, competition of mortgage managers in the housing market was a spur for banks to compete more actively in the market for small business loans, <em>direct</em> competition from mortgage managers in the small business market is likely to be less intense. Some mortgage managers have entered the small business market on a limited scale and with mixed results. ", " The distribution of interest rates paid by small businesses on variable-rate loans is shown in Graph E1, both for the period before the monetary policy easings which began in mid 1996, and for the latest period. Most of the shift to the left (i.e. downward move) of this distribution is due to the easings, as reflected in the fall in the standard overdraft indicator rate from 11.25 per cent in June 1996 to 8.75 per cent in December 1997. In addition, however, the proportion of loans at rates below these indicator rates has increased, due to the availability of new lower-priced products, including residential-secured products. ", " The recent increase in competitive activity has been concentrated in variable-rate loans. The fall in interest rates on fixed-rate loans has been smaller than that for variable-rate loans, in part because banks' margins on fixed-rate loans were always smaller than those on variable-rate loans (as shown in Table E2). In recent months, indicator rates on small business fixed-rate loans have fallen slightly. Those on three-year fixed-rate loans are currently around 7 per cent, 2.9 per cent lower than in mid 1996. This fall is a little more than the fall in the cash rate but roughly in line with the fall in relevant funding rates, which can be approximated by rates in swap markets. ", " The average interest rate measured across all existing fixed-rate loans to small businesses has fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.5 percentage points</span> (to 9.1 per cent) since mid 1996. The smaller fall in this rate than in the indicator rate is because the lower indicator rate has not yet worked through the stock of existing loans. As noted in the previous <cite>Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, during periods of falling interest rates, these adjustment lags work to hold up the average interest rate on fixed-rate loans, while they operate in the opposite direction during periods of rising interest rates. ", " Over the past two years, non-intermediated debt – that is, debt raised by companies issuing securities directly to the market – has picked up sharply, with annual growth rates rising from less than 2 per cent in 1995 to around 30 per cent over the year to March 1998. Since late 1995, the level of non-intermediated debt on issue has almost doubled, having remained broadly unchanged during the first half of <span class=\"no-wrap\">the 1990s (Graph F1)</span>. ", " The rate of increase of non-intermediated debt over the past two years has outpaced that of <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>lending by intermediaries</em></span>. Non-intermediated debt, however, remains a relatively minor source of funds; currently, it amounts to about $38 billion, compared to intermediated credit of about $530 billion. That said, the solid growth in non-intermediated debt has led to the total borrowings (or debt) of households and businesses growing by a bit over 1 percentage point faster than credit from intermediaries over the past year or so, with a growth rate of 13 per cent, or twice the rate of growth of nominal GDP. ", " Around 60 per cent of the non-intermediated funding represents direct approaches to capital markets by corporations (down from around 70 per cent in early 1995), while the remaining 40 per cent reflects issues of debt to finance housing loans by mortgage managers and banks (up from around 30 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 1995)</span>. Some banks have also recently issued debt against corporate loans, although this development has not yet had a significant impact on the figures. The statistics shown here avoid the problem of <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘double counting’</span> since securitisation of loans by banks has the effect of reducing their balance sheets <span class=\"no-wrap\">(and credit)</span> while boosting the level of non-intermediated debt. ", " Non-intermediated corporate debt – such as bond issues and promissory notes – began to rise rapidly in early 1996, following a prolonged period of weakness in the early 1990s when companies had focused on reducing gearing ratios from the unsustainable levels of the late 1980s (Graph F3). This type of debt has grown at about twice the pace of intermediated credit (at an annual rate of around 20 per cent) over the past year. Since early 1990, non-intermediated debt of the corporate sector has doubled as a ratio to intermediated credit, to almost 9 per cent. ", " The growth of the corporate debt market has been helped by the reduction in governments' demands on capital markets and by the growing appetite for securities by superannuation funds. It has also been helped by the fall in inflation, which has led to a sharp fall in capital market interest rates, thereby reducing the relative attractiveness of funding through the banking system. Any long-term tendency for companies to approach capital markets directly should, over time, continue to exert downward pressure on margins on business lending of intermediaries, including banks. ", " The emergence of the mortgage-backed securities market has also owed importantly to these factors. Over the past year, there has been a sharp rise in issues of debt to finance loans by mortgage managers and by banks which have restructured parts of their housing loan portfolios. New lending for housing originated by mortgage managers has grown in the past year at around 1½ times the rate of lending by other financial institutions.

At its low point, in the second half of 1996, annualised growth in real GDP fell to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, according to the national income accounts. By the first half of 1997, growth increased to an annual pace of nearly <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. ", " As is usually the case with such episodes, several cyclical dynamics were at work. The first was the working out of a mild inventory cycle, which now appears largely to have run its course. A second factor was that monetary policy began to ease in mid 1996 in recognition that the outlook for inflation had improved. Inflation had begun to decline to rates much more consistent with the Bank's medium-term inflation target, having been slightly above target for a year or so previously. This reduction in inflation was in turn a result both of the period of more subdued growth, and of the appreciation in the exchange rate during early 1996. It was accompanied by a further structural decline in inflation expectations in various parts of the community, resulting in a change in behaviour which opened up the scope for monetary policy to adopt a more expansionary stance. As a result, the three reductions in official interest rates during 1996 have been followed by two further declines since the first <cite>Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> was issued in May 1997. These changes are having an impact on interest sensitive areas of domestic demand in the economy, which are now contributing to the increase in growth, and there are some encouraging signs in the labour market. In the period ahead, subject to some caveats about export markets (dealt with below) it is reasonable to anticipate that this will continue. ", " Until October, financial markets were reasonably steady, and generally in an optimistic frame of mind. Interest rates paid and charged by financial intermediaries, and yields in money and capital markets, moved to low levels both by historical and international standards, and share prices rose to new highs. The favourable conditions in Australian markets were supported by developments in the main markets overseas, which were mostly buoyant as fears of a pick-up in inflation receded. The instability in financial markets in parts of Asia, which affected first Thailand, and then subsequently spread to Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, to that point had not generally affected Australian or global markets very much. Domestic capital markets remained bullish, and while the exchange rate of the Australian dollar eased against the US dollar, this was due mainly to the strength of the latter. ", " The situation has changed, however, in recent weeks. The trigger was the spread of currency pressures more widely in Asia, particularly to Hong Kong. They quickly spilled over into share prices there, subsequently setting off a period of great volatility in global share markets. The size of the impact of the Asian problems on global markets was something new, but it was most likely due to the fact that markets in some major countries had already reached very high levels by historical standards. As share markets fell, funds flowed into government bonds. Australian markets reflected these global trends, the impact here being, if anything, larger than in most other industrial countries, reflecting our close links to Asia. In addition, we have experienced a net fall in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar over the past fortnight. ", " The outlook for Asia is the key uncertainty in assessing prospects for the Australian economy over the next year or two. Recent events are likely to result in a marked slowing in growth in some of Australia's Asian trading partners, with consequent loss of export sales and reduced income flows from foreign operations of Australian firms. The extent and duration of this is difficult to predict with any degree of confidence, because asset price falls and subsequent banking problems are a central part of the unfolding events. Much will depend on how successful the various countries are at confronting and dealing with these and other problems, and how quickly the confidence of financial markets can be regained. Assistance by the International Monetary Fund to Thailand and Indonesia should help this process, and provide a basis for recovery. Australia's participation in both of these programs has helped in quickly formulating these regional support packages. Developments in North America, where growth remains strong, and Europe, where it is picking up, may also provide some partial offset to the pessimistic news from our north. ", " Despite some precautionary rises in interest rates in Europe and North America, there are few signs of inflationary pressures around the world, and the Australian economy is sharing in this good inflation performance. The forces which have acted to bring inflation down to unusually low levels over the recent period are, however, likely to wane over the coming year to 18 months. Within that period, underlying inflation is likely to edge up to be a little above <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, and remain consistent with the target thereafter. While this remains the case, monetary policy will be able to maintain its present stance, which is moderately encouraging to growth. ", " The events in Asia are still unfolding, and further instability in financial markets cannot be ruled out. The subsequent efforts of Asian countries to resume growth via exports may increase international competition and further dampen prices in world markets. This environment underscores the need for costs in Australia to remain tightly controlled. It is disappointing that earlier signs of slowing in growth of Australian labour costs do not appear to have continued, judging from the most recent data. While current rates of growth of wages and salaries are still consistent with achieving the inflation target, faster reductions in unemployment would be achievable were wages growth to be slower. ", " Since the 1960s, east Asia has recorded exceptional rates of economic growth. For the most part, this has been trade-oriented growth, underpinned by generally prudent macroeconomic policies. Fiscal policies have been conservative, inflation has been moderate, and domestic saving has been high. The very strong rates of investment in a number of Asian countries outstripped even the high domestic saving rates, with substantial current account deficits providing the extra resources for investment. The inflow of foreign capital which financed these deficits stepped up in the 1990s, reflecting changing perceptions in world capital markets about these ‘emerging economies’. The flows were facilitated by the financial deregulation and institutional development occurring in these countries. Encouraged by high rates of expected return characteristic of rapidly growing dynamic economies and the shift of production capacity from high-cost countries such as Japan, these flows in some instances amounted to <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> of GDP over a number of years <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 1)</span>. ", " The combination of rapid growth and large capital inflows was reflected in rapid credit expansion, an over-extension of corporate balance sheets, rising equity and property prices, over-investment in particular sectors and some lowering of the quality of investment undertaken. At the same time, the rapid growth of the financial sector outpaced the development of prudential regulation and left the financial sectors of these economies vulnerable. The heavy recourse to foreign financing was often of a short-term nature, with the borrower bearing the foreign exchange risk in many cases. ", " This combination of circumstances gave these economies an outstanding record of growth, but also left them vulnerable to changes in sentiment, and with financial sectors which lacked resilience when confidence deteriorated. An initially modest reassessment of credit risk and exchange rate relativities has been enough to spark off substantial exchange rate changes and a process of widespread financial strains which seem likely to cut growth rates in the ‘ASEAN-4’ – Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines – for the immediate future. ", " The trigger was the emergence of exchange rate pressures, beginning in Thailand. The practice of keeping exchange rates reasonably constant against the US dollar meant that several Asian countries had suffered a fall in competitiveness in the past couple of years (Graph 1) as the US dollar rose strongly against most other currencies, particularly the yen. The impact of this deterioration in competitiveness on the east Asian economies was exacerbated in 1996 by a world-wide slump in the semi-conductor market – a market in which east Asia had increasingly specialised. Thus by late 1996 and early 1997, downward pressure was starting to be felt on the exchange rates of the most exposed Asian countries and capital inflow was drying up, or in some cases turning to outflow. The situation was not helped by the increasing recognition that difficulties were being experienced by banks and other financial intermediaries, particularly in Thailand. ", " While the Thai authorities managed for a time to resist these pressures, they were eventually forced to float the exchange rate in early July. The baht exchange rate quickly fell by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span>. This intensified pressures on other countries and, in the weeks that followed, the Indonesian rupiah and Philippine peso were also floated. The Malaysian ringgit was not formally floated, but was managed much more flexibly and its movements broadly paralleled those of the other three currencies (Graph 2). By end August, the Thai baht had depreciated by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span> from its pre-May level, the Indonesian and Philippine currencies were down by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span>, and the Malaysian ringgit had fallen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span>. ", " This initial adjustment of exchange rates was followed by a brief period of stability in September, helped by the announcement of the IMF's rescue package for Thailand. This involved a US$17 billion assistance package, encompassing IMF resources and bilateral assistance from other countries in the region (including Australia). As part of the package, Thailand agreed to implement economic reforms, including fiscal measures, a reduction in reliance on foreign capital inflow and further restructuring of a number of ailing financial institutions. ", " By late September, however, exchange rates of the four currencies in question began to depreciate again. One factor behind the resumption of exchange pressures was market concerns about some of the responses by governments to the emerging difficulties. Markets also focused on the possible inter-relationships between the falls in exchange rates, capital flows, falls in property prices and the health of the financial systems concerned. The general increase in interest rates in the region, in order to support exchange rates, was seen as adding to the difficulties in asset markets. In some east Asian countries, the likelihood that the exchange rate falls would add to strains in financial systems was heightened by the high levels of foreign currency borrowings by residents. Exchange rates in these four countries have now fallen by between 25 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> since mid 1997. ", " Until late October, the pressures were confined largely to the four ASEAN economies but they then spread to other countries, including Hong Kong. The stability of the exchange rate in Hong Kong is a political as well as an economic issue, as Hong Kong has promoted the fixed exchange rate to the US dollar as the corner-stone of stability and an essential part of the ‘one country-two systems’ policy. Markets assessed that the authorities in Hong Kong would resist any change in the exchange rate despite the loss of competitiveness, and that the inevitable rise in interest rates would have adverse implications for economic activity and asset markets. On the day of most intense pressure in October, the Hong Kong authorities pushed overnight interest rates to <span class=\"no-wrap\">300 per cent</span>, and the share market fell by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span>. Given the importance of Hong Kong in world financial markets, the impact quickly spilled outside the region; sharp falls were experienced in equity prices around the globe and there was a ‘flight to quality’ into government bonds. ", " From the float of the Thai baht on 2 July until mid October, the problems in Asia had no significant impact on Australian markets. While the Australian dollar has been falling against the US dollar for much of 1997 (Graph 4), most of the explanation for this was the strength of the US currency, although narrowing interest differentials and lacklustre commodity prices also played a part. ", " However, when the problems in Asia spread in late October, Australian markets were caught up in the ensuing global turbulence. Events in Asia seem to have had three main effects on Australian markets. First, they caused a fall in the exchange rate. The spreading of the Asian instability to Hong Kong was responsible for the fall of the Australian dollar from about US 74 cents to US 71 cents. It probably also contributed to the exaggerated response to the fall in the price of gold at the end of October; the Australian dollar fell from US 70.5 cents to <span class=\"no-wrap\">US 68.5 cents</span> after the Swiss made further announcements about possible changes in the management of gold reserves. Speculators who had been selling the Australian dollar earlier on Asian concerns, were reinforced in their actions by the fall in the gold price. While the Australian dollar staged some recovery towards the end of October as share markets and gold prices showed signs of stabilising, it has nonetheless fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span> against the US dollar since the start of 1997. In trade-weighted terms, the Australian dollar has held up better, and is not far from its long-run average. ", " The second impact of the Asian crisis has been on our share market. Australian share prices fell sharply in October. The fall was part of a world-wide reaction on share markets (Table 2), though the Australian fall was a little larger than the average of other industrial countries. This greater impact is a reflection of our close economic links with Asia. All sectors of the Australian market were affected by the volatility in October, though resource companies, with their large exposure to Asian markets, and which had underperformed in the earlier rising market, fared the worst from the market fall. ", " This is probably the first time that share market falls in Asia have had a significant impact on industrial countries' share prices. In large part this was because many market participants felt that a correction in global share markets was overdue. Signs had been apparent before the fallout from Asia of increasing nervousness in share markets. Share prices in most countries reached a peak in late July, when they seemed to lose upward momentum, as spirits were dampened by some downward revisions to profit forecasts in the US. In this climate, a shock in any major financial centre, either in Asia or elsewhere, had the potential to trigger substantial corrections in prices in other markets, which were widely recognised as overheated. ", " The third area to be affected was the bond market. Here, the immediate impact was positive, reflecting a <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘flight to quality’</span> by share investors seeking stability of income flows and greater certainty about capital values and credit standing. ", " Prior to the escalation of the Asian crisis, world bond markets had begun to show signs of nervousness, and bond yields had begun to rise. This move started when Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan expressed concerns about the potential for US inflation to rise, given the prevailing tightness of labour markets there. Financial markets saw this as a sign that the US was moving closer to the point of tightening monetary policy again. The rise in yields was reinforced by the tightening of monetary policy by a number of European central banks in mid October. ", " The move up in world bond yields was reversed when the Hong Kong stock market fell sharply on 22 October, as investors sought safe haven in bonds. From <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.2 per cent</span> in mid October, US yields fell back to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.8 per cent</span>. Here in Australia, yields on 10-year bonds fell from a high of almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.5 per cent</span>, reached after the publication of disappointing wage data on 23 October, to around 6 per cent at present <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 5)</span>. As in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US market</span>, the key factor underlying the fall in local bond yields was the switch out of equities. ", " The recent gyrations should not distract attention from some favourable longer-term trends in interest rates, both in Australia and abroad. While the decline in bond yields in late October reflects ‘safe-haven’ considerations that might not be sustained indefinitely, bond yields in Australia had already fallen to their lowest levels since financial deregulation in the early 1980s, which allowed yields to be set freely by the market. The fall in yields has resulted in a further sharp narrowing of the premium over US securities which investors used to require (<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). While a number of influences, including the improvement in the fiscal position of the Government, contributed to this reduction, the primary factor is the low level of inflation. Dormant inflationary pressures represent highly favourable conditions for bond markets. ", " The exact extent of the financial difficulties faced in a number of Asian economies remains extremely difficult to judge. Reliable information is scarce, and to a large extent questions of asset valuation are inherently subjective and based on forecasts of future prices. It is clear nonetheless that several countries in the region face a period of adjustment to lower asset values and rebuilding of corporate and bank balance sheets. ", " The full resolution of problems in banking systems will take some time. Experience in other countries which have had such difficulties indicates that the speed with which these problems are identified, and arrangements set in place for resolving them, are critical in determining how quickly the broader economy can be returned to better health and the confidence of domestic and international financial markets regained. However, even with a good policy response, a period of very weak economic growth can be expected for these countries. During that time, their imports will be depressed, with adverse repercussions for countries exporting into the area. ", " In the meantime, export sectors of a number of countries will receive a boost from depreciated currencies. Here the experience of Mexico after the 1994 crisis is instructive. The fall in the Mexican peso (which was, admittedly, of a larger magnitude than the falls experienced by the ASEAN-4 currencies) was followed by export growth at an average annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">26 per cent</span> over the subsequent two years. The <span class=\"no-wrap\">ASEAN-4</span> countries have larger export sectors, relative to the size of their economies, than Mexico (even when the comparison is made on the basis of exports to destinations outside the <span class=\"no-wrap\">ASEAN-4 region)</span>, in some cases by a large margin <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 3)</span>. As a consequence, expansion of export growth could be a considerable boost to these economies. ", " The extent to which instability in Asian share markets has fed back to markets in major industrial countries is a new phenomenon, but the declines in share prices in those latter countries have been smaller than past corrections. As such, the decline in wealth is unlikely to depress spending significantly in those countries. Even after the 1987 sharemarket correction, which was significantly larger, US and global growth in 1988 was very strong – to the point that interest rates around the world rose that year. Speculative excesses subsequently occurred in property markets, with a subsequent downturn in property markets exacerbating a business-cycle slowing. ", " Assessments of the effects of recent events on the Australian economy are subject to considerable uncertainty. Much will depend on the size and duration of the slowing in growth in Australia's Asian trading partners, and what happens in the rest of the world – where the other half of Australia's exports are sold. While ever the acute difficulties were likely to be confined largely to the four ASEAN countries initially hit by the turbulence, the implications for Australia were likely to be reasonably contained. These countries take about <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> of Australian exports, and supply about <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> of Australian imports (Table 4). They account for 10 per cent of short-term visitor arrivals, and a quarter of foreign students studying in Australia. Merchandise exports to these countries have grown at a high average rate over recent years, slowing in 1996 but beginning to recover in 1997; a significant further slowing would have a noticeable effect on aggregate exports. Nonetheless, the bulk of the growth in exports to east Asia has been to the north-east Asian countries, which are much bigger markets – accounting for over <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> of Australian exports. Since 1990, the total quantity of Australia's exports has grown at an average annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">7½ per cent;</span> about 1½ percentage points of this has come from the <span class=\"no-wrap\">ASEAN-4</span> countries, and about twice that contribution has come from the other east Asian countries (Graph 6). ", " The slowing in ASEAN itself would not necessarily lead to a major reduction in growth in north-east Asia: the trade exposures of those countries to ASEAN are generally no higher than Australia's (Table 5). Most of the north-east Asian countries have experienced an acceleration in their own export growth over recent months, after a pronounced slowing in 1996 (Graph 7). This has tended to hold out some hope that Australian exports would in turn grow more quickly, and on the most recent data, this appears to have been happening (Graph 8). The danger now is that financial fragility, and/or tight financial policies in the wake of the market volatility of recent months, may retard growth in a broader group of countries. This risk appears to be largest in South Korea, where despite a pick-up in export growth over recent months, and continued robust growth in industrial output, corporate insolvencies have sapped confidence and strained the banking system. ", " While these events play out, the Japanese recovery appears to have suffered another setback. The June quarter accounts showed a much bigger than expected fall in GDP of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.9 per cent</span>, and business sentiment, as recorded in the Tankan survey, has deteriorated in recent months (Graph 9). The existing difficulties of the Japanese banks may be exacerbated by the recent financial market turbulence throughout Asia. The Japanese economy has experienced weak economic performance for some years now, and Australian exports to Japan have recorded virtually no growth over the past five years. This hindered overall export performance much less than might have been expected, because the considerable expansion in other Asian countries allowed exporters to find alternative growth opportunities. Looking forward, the likelihood that south and north-east Asian trading partners will experience slower growth for a time, while Japan remains weak, provides a difficult external environment for Australia. ", " Another effect on Australia could be through the property market as Asian investors have been active in purchasing units in high-density residential developments over the past few years. This activity might be expected to slow. ", " The Australian economy is well placed, however, to weather the worst of the financial shock which has hit the region. An important factor which determines the extent to which declines in asset values have a broader impact on the economy is the extent of leverage. Holdings of equities in Australia are not routinely financed with borrowed funds; property prices have not staged a large run-up, except in inner city residential areas, which makes the probability of a major, broadly based decline reasonably low; lenders are well capitalised and the credit process is working well. So while there will almost certainly be some, as yet unquantifiable, dampening effect on the Australian economy operating through trade channels, this should not be compounded by financial difficulties. ", " Also important in an overall assessment of Australia's external environment are developments in the United States and Europe. In contrast to the situation in east Asia, the United States economy continues to record good growth, while growth in the major European economies appears to be picking up after a prolonged period of weaker performance. These trends will help to provide a base of support for external demand and may, to some extent, mitigate some of the effects on Australia of the east Asian difficulties. ", " The <em>United States</em> economic expansion has been a remarkably steady one, with year-ended growth rarely outside the 2 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> range since 1992; over the past year, growth was <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> (Graph 10). The unemployment rate has been on a trend decline throughout the expansion, reaching <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.9 per cent</span> in September 1997. Despite the tightening labour market, inflation has so far remained subdued, with core consumer prices rising by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.2 per cent</span> in the year to September, their lowest annual rate of increase since 1966. ", " Activity in the three largest continental <em>European</em> economies (Germany, France and Italy), after having been sluggish for several years, now appears to be picking up a little faster than had been expected. The European Commission has recently revised upwards its forecasts for growth across the European Union by 0.2 percentage points in both 1997 and 1998, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.6 per cent</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.0 per cent</span> respectively. Signs of strengthening in the large continental economies are particularly apparent in their industrial production data. Consumer price inflation remains relatively subdued, although a pick-up in import prices in Germany has pushed up inflation rates there a little. This prompted a rise in short-term rates in Germany in October, which was followed by France and several smaller countries. In the United Kingdom, output rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.9 per cent</span> in the year to the September quarter, underpinned by strong domestic demand and an unemployment rate that continues to fall. The Bank of England has gradually raised the interbank rate to its current level of <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> to resist inflationary pressures flowing from the tight labour market and strong demand. ", " The Australian economy has grown a little faster during 1997 than in 1996. In the first half of 1997, real GDP expanded at an annualised pace of just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>, following a relatively weak second half of 1996, when growth was about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> (Table 6). In the non-farm sector of the economy, the turnaround was a little more marked, from around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> in the latter half of 1996 to 3¾ per cent in the first half of 1997. ", " Growth has been supported by a solid expansion of private-sector final demand, which over the past couple of years has been increasing at a rate of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. Strong growth in business investment has continued to be a major driver of the expansion to date, with dwelling investment now beginning to play a more prominent role. Private consumption appears to have strengthened recently, after a weak showing in 1996. For a time, some of this growth of domestic demand was supplied by running down inventories, so that output ran behind. In addition, a slowing in export growth in 1996 and early 1997, particularly to a number of countries in north-east Asia, meant that net absorption of Australian output by the rest of the world declined. More recently, however, the inventory correction appears to have largely run its course, while a stronger performance of the north-east Asian economies during 1997 to date has seen a pick-up in export growth since March. ", " The latest available data suggest that the expansion is continuing, with signs that employment growth may be starting to respond to the firmer trend in production. If so, the resulting growth in household incomes will support ongoing growth in consumption. Question marks remain over the outlook for exports, arising from a likely slowing in east Asian economies next year and the possibility of wider repercussions. The following sections cover the household and business sectors and Australia's balance of payments. ", " Consumer spending on goods has been rising during 1997, after a period of weakening demand through the second half of 1996. The strength of the upward trend has been difficult to gauge, because of the effects generated by shifting timing of holiday-related spending. Retail sales around Christmas 1996 were unusually weak. Demand then strengthened appreciably early in 1997, only to slow again from March to May. More recently, stronger growth has resumed, with <em>retail trade</em> in the September quarter rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.1 per cent</span> in real terms, after a decline of <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the June quarter (Graph 11). Over the year to September, growth was <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.8 per cent</span>, compared with a fall of 0.6 per cent over the year to December 1996. ", " The detailed data for retail trade show differing patterns of growth between types of expenditure, with growth in demand for services over the past year generally stronger, by a good margin, than for goods. This pattern is even clearer in the national accounts estimates for private consumption, where the items recorded in the monthly retail trade data make up a little under half of consumption outlays for households. Estimates for spending on the other half – the broad range of services which includes recreation, entertainment, telecommunications and financial services – suggest quite robust growth. This reflects the continuation of the structural change towards services which has been occurring in the economy for many years. ", " Demand for <em>motor vehicles</em> has increased substantially over the past six months. Registrations of passenger vehicles in the September quarter were <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier. Some of this expansion in demand has been prompted by highly competitive prices for imported vehicles, which have taken a large share of the increased expenditure. Nonetheless, demand for vehicles across the board has been increasing. This has been assisted by declining interest rates, as attested by a noticeable strengthening in personal finance commitments for motor vehicles. ", " Growth in <em>household income</em> has been lower than usual over the past year, as a result of sluggish employment. This trend may have been one factor in constraining spending by households, although the timing of the slowing suggests that the deceleration in income was as much a result of the slowing in consumer demand as a cause of it. Households appear to have lifted their saving rate a little over the past year or so, after a period of several years in which saving rates fell. They may have tended towards a rather cautious attitude to expenditure, particularly under conditions of labour market uncertainty. Over much of the past year, information available from surveys of <em>consumer sentiment</em> has suggested heightened pessimism about employment prospects, although this appears to have abated in the most recent surveys. Overall consumer sentiment indexes have remained at levels above their historical averages throughout the past couple of years. People remain considerably more optimistic about their own personal financial situation than about the economy generally. ", " Demand for <em>residential property</em> has increased significantly over the past year. Over the three months to August 1997, new loans totalling $17 billion were approved by housing lenders, some <span class=\"no-wrap\">38 per cent</span> more than in the corresponding period a year earlier. As is usually the case early in a housing upswing, a large part of the finance has been for the purchase of existing dwellings by owner occupiers, but finance approvals for construction or purchase of newly erected dwellings have also increased strongly over the past nine months. In value terms, these are now about <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> higher than a year ago (Graph 12). ", " This increase in borrowing has been facilitated by the substantial reduction in mortgage interest rates which has occurred over the past year. With the reduction in cash rates and the increased competition amongst lenders in the market, interest rates for borrowers have fallen to their lowest levels in a generation. More generally, in the 1990s as a whole, the advent of low inflation, and the much lower structure of interest rates which has occurred as a result, have eased the debt servicing burden of many households. In some cases, this is allowing households to pay off debt faster than might otherwise have occurred – that is, to increase their saving; in these instances, the potential to expand consumption in the future would be enhanced. In most cases, however, households have made greater use of borrowing, and household debt levels have increased substantially in the 1990s (<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>), as lower interest rates have made it feasible to service larger loans. ", " This increased recourse to borrowing resulting from lower interest rates is being reflected in the residential property sector both in the form of higher <em>prices</em> for existing dwellings, and increased <em>construction</em> of new dwellings. Price rises have been most noticeable to date in Sydney, particularly in the inner suburbs, and in Melbourne. An overall measure of Sydney prices published by the REIA shows an increase of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over the year to June 1997; for suburbs reasonably close to the CBD, the increase has been of the order of <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span>. Areas further out have shown much smaller increases. There also appears to be an upward trend in areas of Melbourne, where prices overall have risen significantly over the past year. An upturn in prices appears to have commenced in some other cities as well. ", " <em>Approvals</em> to build private dwellings began to increase around the turn of the year, and rose quite quickly through to May. They then fell away for a couple of months, but remain on a gradual upward trend. In September, approvals were <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier. Dwelling <em>commencements</em> began to increase in the March quarter and, despite a fall being recorded in June, should show a rise in the September quarter and beyond. ", " There is little doubt that the housing upswing will continue. Several features of the current cycle, however, are unusual. The first is the prominent role of investors, which account for about one-third of the total value of lending approved for housing, about the same as in the peak of the late 1980s, but up from one-sixth in the early 1990s. Associated with this, the indicators of construction show a higher proportion of approvals are for multi-unit dwellings than on most previous occasions. This may reflect a structural change in the way Australians are choosing to house themselves, with a trend towards higher density living, including in the inner areas of the larger cities. There has probably been some effect of the interest of Asian investors, which is now likely to abate. ", " A second feature is a substantial increase in the average real value of a building approval. This is not price inflation – indexes of prices of building materials have shown only small increases in recent years, although they are now increasing a little more quickly. It appears to reflect an increase in the size and quality of new dwellings. In essence, new dwellings on average have more rooms and better quality fittings than used to be the case; in real terms, the average value per dwelling of new building approvals is now about <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> higher than it was at the beginning of the decade. ", " The third noteworthy feature of the present upswing is its geographical unevenness. The strength in construction activity continues, on the most recent data, to be concentrated in Victoria and New South Wales. Other areas, particularly Queensland, which has in the past accounted for about a third of the annual increase in the dwelling stock, have not seen a strong pick-up in activity as yet. This is likely to be, in part, a reflection of lingering excess supply of dwellings left over from the previous upswing. That upswing, which finished in 1994, was unusually long, and over a three-year period saw more dwellings constructed than at any time since the early 1970s. The excess supply will, in due course, be cleared, leading to increased construction activity in these other areas. A possible implication of these currently diverse trends is that the housing cycle could be sequential in nature, with less of the characteristics of a nationwide ‘boom’, than seen in the past. ", " Companies have found it harder to sustain growth in profits over the past couple of years, in the face of more moderate output growth, rising labour costs in some areas and the discipline on prices arising from subdued demand conditions and increased competition in domestic and international markets. For those involved in exporting, a slowing in export sales during 1996 also will have made for more difficult trading conditions. In 1996/97, operating <em>profitability</em> of the private corporate sector, as measured in the national income <span class=\"no-wrap\">accounts (adjusted for privatisations)</span>,rose by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>, after an increase of <span class=\"no-wrap\">6½ per cent</span> in 1995/96. These figures compare with an average increase of nearly <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> in the preceding two years. As a share of GDP, corporate profits remain near their average level of the past decade or so, but have tended to decline a little over recent quarters. Net profits reported by major listed companies have in a number of instances been reduced by the effects of writing down the value of assets, often those acquired in international expansion programs earlier in the 1990s. ", " Companies have been responding to these pressures on profitability in a variety of ways. One element of adjustment over the past year has been to control inventories tightly. Stronger demand early in 1997 for goods was substantially met from stocks. On the most recent data, the process of running down stocks appears to have been largely completed. Most industries have stocks to sales ratios in line with historical trends. ", " Another response to profitability pressures has been labour shedding. Many large-scale and medium-size enterprises continue to rationalise their workforces, looking to eliminate past practices which led to overstaffing, to contract out many non-core activities to specialist firms which can provide them more cheaply, and so on. Public enterprises approaching or undergoing privatisation have also tended to shed staff. In some areas where labour's bargaining power is relatively strong, such as parts of manufacturing and finance, substantial pay rises have occurred simultaneously with sizeable workforce reductions. ", " These forces are, of course, always at work but are more visible in periods where overall economic growth is weaker. The longer-run pay-off from rationalisation of corporate operations is that productivity growth improves, the economy's potential growth rate increases, and investment and employment increase. Aggregate data on productivity increasingly confirm what anecdotal evidence has been suggesting for some time: that the trend productivity growth of the factors of production in Australia, as summarised by total-factor productivity, has lifted noticeably during the 1990s (<a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). Productivity growth in Australia appears to be outpacing the average for developed countries in the 1990s, after many years of lagging behind. There is, nonetheless, much ground to make up. Some questions also remain about the relationship between wages and labour productivity, and these are taken up in the section on labour markets below. ", " In the period ahead, firming growth offers the prospect that profitability will be sustained, and improved. Inventory levels are well controlled. Broader indicators of <em>business sentiment</em> continue to suggest confidence about the medium-term future, recent difficulties notwithstanding. If anything, in recent surveys this confidence about expected trading conditions has increased further (Graph 13). Indicators of current trading conditions have not changed much, although it is worth noting that while this fact sometimes is reported as though conditions are weak, many of the relevant data series are at or above their longer-run average. These business confidence indicators suggest that an expansion in employment is more likely, provided growth in labour costs is contained, and some firming of employment growth prospects is confirmed by the bulk of business surveys, and by higher levels of job vacancies. The recent employment data suggest that this growth may have begun, although it is too early to be sure of this yet. ", " A reflection of reasonable levels of confidence has been the fact that throughout the recent period of slower output growth, <em>business investment</em> activity has remained quite strong. In the June quarter of 1997, investment spending was <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> higher, in real terms, than a year earlier. This was a slower rate of increase than had been recorded in the preceding 12 months, but was much faster than the rate of growth of most other components of spending in the economy. ", " Strength continued to be concentrated in <em>equipment investment</em>, which increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> over the year to June. This came after a five-year period in which the average rate of increase for equipment investment was over <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> in real terms. As a share of GDP, investment spending on equipment has returned from quite low levels reached during the recession in the early 1990s to about its longer-run average <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 14)</span>. Forward looking indicators for equipment investment have for some time been signalling that its rate of increase could slow during 1997/98. Initial estimates for 1997/98 in the ABS Capital Expenditure Survey, in fact, suggested a decline in this component of investment spending. The most recent estimates suggest a significant upward revision of intentions, such that a slightly higher level of investment is now on the cards in the current year. Nonetheless, this would represent a noticeable slowing in its rate of growth. ", " In some respects, such a pause in the investment cycle would not be altogether surprising, given that a number of years of strong growth have occurred, and the fact that in areas such as manufacturing, rates of capacity utilisation have tended to decline over the past two years. Firms would have the option of waiting for higher output growth to take up some of the existing capacity, before feeling the need to add to it. Investment spending over the past year or two has also been boosted to some extent by the telecommunications sector, with cable roll-outs etc. Investment at that pace could not continue, although there can be little doubt that reasonably high rates of investment in communications and computer technology are likely to be a feature of the economic scene for the foreseeable future. ", " In contrast to equipment spending, spending on <em>buildings and structures</em> is recorded to have weakened in the middle of 1997. This particular observation appears to reflect the completion of the Crown Casino in Melbourne, work on which had pushed up investment data for several previous quarters. The most recent ABS survey suggests that this type of spending is likely to decline in 1997/98, although this component of the survey is likely to be less reliable than that relating to equipment investment. Together, these indicators could be taken as suggesting that the construction cycle has already peaked and turned down. ", " If such an outcome were to eventuate, it would be surprising in several respects. Construction has been much slower to resume growth than was spending on equipment after the early 1990s recession, due in large measure to the over-investment of the late 1980s. It would seem unlikely for that upswing to have already finished. The number of non-residential building approvals exhibited weakness during the first half of 1997, but has increased strongly again in recent months with rises recorded in most categories. Taking into account engineering construction, which is much more prominent in this cycle than in the late 1980s, the pipeline of work to be done is quite substantial (Graph 15), with several infrastructure projects and large amounts of long-term investment in the mining sector under way. Hence it seems unlikely that a substantial decline in construction activity will occur over the next year; a modest further expansion is more likely. This judgment is consistent with persistent reports of skill shortages and pressure on wages in the construction sector. ", " While rates of investment growth seen in recent years may not be sustainable, there is little reason to expect a substantial decline in investment while the corporate sector and the economy generally remain free of major imbalances. Firms' financial situations are certainly no constraint on their activities. In regular business surveys, few firms nominate the cost or availability of credit as a significant impediment to their operations. Business demand for credit from financial intermediaries appears to have strengthened a little over recent months. Business credit outstanding rose at an annualised pace of over <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> in the six months to September, compared with <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> in the preceding six months. Data on commercial finance commitments also show an increase over the past six months or so (Graph 16). Equity raisings have also been strong this year, helped by a rising share market. Over the six months to August, raisings of new equity, apart from privatisations, totalled $6.6 billion, the highest rate for two years. Despite these increases, firms now appear to be in a phase where leverage is starting to increase a little, after a number of years when it was stable or falling. Competition amongst lenders has resulted in a slight decline in credit standards over the past year or so. The impact of recent financial turbulence on these trends is not yet clear, although the volatility of the stock market may make equity raising more difficult for a time. Uncertainty surrounding the international environment could also prompt a more cautious attitude to business investment in some areas. ", " Signs developed during 1997 of a strong <span lang=\"es\">El Niño</span> event, which involves a sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, usually leading to drier-than-normal weather conditions over eastern Australia and south-east Asia. Consistent with the signs of <span lang=\"es\">El Niño</span>, rainfall over much of eastern Australia was below average in the three months to the end of August (Graph 17). Against the odds, however, many parts of Australia received well-above-average rainfall in September and October. ", " With the signs of El Niño still present, meteorologists continue to forecast below-average rainfall for eastern Australia into early 1998. But with the recent rains having occurred at a critical time for the winter grain crop, the Australian Wheat Board has revised up the 1997–98 wheat production forecast substantially. ", " Meat production, which accounts for about one-quarter of farm output, rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> in 1996–97 as farmers increased slaughterings in response to their expectations of drought. Beef exports to north-east Asia have strengthened, with the value of exports to Japan – Australia's largest market – in the first nine months of 1997 up by <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> over the same period last year. Live cattle exports continued to grow strongly in 1996–97, but have softened since then. Conditions improved in the wool industry, with stronger demand from China, Italy and Taiwan, which together accounted for about half of wool exports in 1996–97. ", " Import volumes have picked up as economic activity has strengthened in 1997. Following a relatively weak March quarter, the quantity of imports rose strongly in the June quarter, and into the second half of 1997, particularly imports of consumption and intermediate goods (Graph 18). The rise in consumption imports has been fairly broadly based, but with motor vehicle imports being particularly strong. Capital imports rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> over the year to June 1997 reflecting the strong investment in plant and equipment over this time; since then capital imports have flattened out at a relatively high level. Service imports have also been reasonably firm, growing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.5 per cent</span> in 1996/97, with strength concentrated in shipment and other transport services. ", " Export volumes have also firmed. Excluding one-off factors (the sale of gold and a frigate), exports of manufactured and resource goods appear to have been notably stronger in 1997 than in the latter half of 1996. This seems to reflect improved demand from our major trading partners in north-east Asia in the first half of this year, following a period of weakness in 1996. Rural exports rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">13.5 per cent</span> in 1996/97 following a bumper wheat harvest. As yields return to more normal levels, rural exports are expected to fall somewhat although, so far, they have shown surprising resilience. As discussed above, recent developments in east Asia raise some important risks to the outlook for exports to the region. ", " Net payments on Australia's external liabilities – the net income deficit – rose from $4.6 billion in the March quarter to $5.1 billion in the June quarter. This rise was due primarily to stronger income debits, reflecting higher dividend payments on foreign investment in Australia; income credits also rose marginally. The <em>current account deficit</em> also rose somewhat, from a little over <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> of GDP in the March quarter to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3¾ per cent</span> in the June quarter (after excluding the gold and frigate sales). This rise reflected both the rise in the net income deficit and the strength in imports. ", " Commodity prices in aggregate have shown little change over the course of 1997, having previously risen to a level about half way between their recent low in 1993 and their latest peak in 1990 (Graph 19). Reflecting continued falls in import prices, Australia's terms of trade have increased steadily since the trough in 1993. ", " Non-rural commodity prices have been quite stable over 1997, with strength in base metal prices, which have risen by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> since December 1996, having been offset by a weaker gold price; oil has traded in a narrow range around US$20 a barrel since early in 1997. Rural prices are about <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> higher than they were at the start of the year, mainly due to stronger prices for wool and sugar. The wool price has risen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span> since the end of 1996 and is now more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> above its average level over the past five years, reflecting stronger demand from Europe and China. In contrast, wheat prices have fallen since the middle of the year, reflecting a particularly large expected US wheat harvest and expanded production in Europe. ", " Employment in the early and middle part of 1997 was weak, but seems to have improved recently (Graph 20). In the first half of the year there was a shift in the mix of employment towards part-time work, continuing the longer-run trend in that direction, so that the decline in full-time employment was greater than the total <span class=\"no-wrap\">decline (Graph 21)</span>. Since June, however, this situation has been reversed, and full-time employment has been picking up. For much of the past year, labour force participation was declining, reflecting the weaker demand for labour in evidence until recently. The unemployment rate has continued to fluctuate around <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span>, as it has for the past two years. ", " Volatility of the monthly employment figures makes the trends difficult to interpret, but the recent pick-up in full-time employment may signal some firming in the demand for labour. Alternative ‘matched sample’ estimates of total employment also point to some pick-up in recent months. These estimates are a little less volatile than the published data, and suggest modest increases in employment in both the June and September quarters (<a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>). ", " With employment growth normally lagging behind developments in activity, the weaker employment trend evident in early and mid 1997 reflects, to an important degree, the subdued pace of growth in 1996. Growth in non-farm GDP in 1996 was <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.6 per cent</span> and, in the second half of the year, slowed to an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span>, well below the average growth rate in the course of the current economic expansion to date, and below the economy's growth potential. Given this slowing in GDP growth, it is not surprising that the employment trend also weakened significantly. Conversely, although the time lags are uncertain, the pick-up in growth under way in 1997 can be expected to be followed by stronger employment growth in the latter part of the year. ", " The industry composition of employment changes over the year to August shows quite wide variations in labour market conditions (Graph 22). Relatively large employment reductions over the year are recorded in public administration, while employment also declined in other industries with traditionally high public-sector involvement, namely education, utilities and communication, as well as in mining and construction. In contrast, growth was relatively robust in the private-sector service industries such as property and business services, personal services and recreation. ", " Consistent with the stronger growth in activity occurring in 1997, there are a number of signs from the <span class=\"no-wrap\">forward-looking</span> indicators that the demand for labour may be firming. The number of job vacancies has been showing a modest upward trend for some time, although both the ABS and ANZ vacancies series have been subject to some short-term volatility. Business surveys suggest that hiring intentions have improved recently. In contrast, overtime hours worked have remained flat at a level not far above last year's trough. In part, this may reflect continuing absorption of regular overtime into standard working hours under the terms of many enterprise agreements. ", " In addition to the cyclical behaviour of employment, which can best be explained by movements in aggregate demand such as the slowing in 1996, there are other longer-term influences on employment which are more subtle. Historically an important influence in Australia has been the interaction between real wages and productivity. While the behaviour of real wages in the 1990s has been nothing like the exceptional behaviour that occurred in the 1970s, real wages in the 1990s have nevertheless risen a good deal faster than in the 1980s. ", " The average increase in weekly ordinary-time earnings in the six-year period since the cyclical trough in output has been <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span>, compared with average growth of non-farm product prices of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.7 per cent</span>. This represents a cumulative increase in the real wage measured in terms of producer prices of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span>. This is in sharp contrast to the 1980s expansion when real wages were flat or falling (Graph 23). There are clearly a number of reasons for the differences in real-wage outcomes between the two cycles, including the role of the Accord in restraining real wages in the 1980s after a significant lift early in the decade, as well as the more rapid trend productivity growth in the 1990s. Nonetheless, other things equal, relatively rapid increases in real wages will tend to increase the pressure on businesses to downsize their workforces, leading to somewhat lower aggregate employment growth than would otherwise be the case. Compared to the 1980s, the current expansion has been characterised by stronger real wages and weaker average growth in employment. ", " This pattern is also evident in international comparisons. In international terms, Australia's economic growth performance over the past five years has been good: average GDP growth in Australia and New Zealand has been higher than in any of the G7 countries over that period (Table 7). While Australia's average growth rate of employment of 1¾ per cent looks high by international standards, it is not high when compared to our rate of growth of output. The Australian economy has not been good at converting output growth into jobs growth. In the United States, employment growth has been nearly as high as Australia's, despite having significantly lower GDP growth, while New Zealand, with roughly the same growth in output as Australia, produced substantially higher employment growth. A corollary of these observations, of course, is that productivity growth in Australia has been higher. However, to the extent that productivity gains are induced by uncompetitive wage outcomes rather than structural improvements in efficiency, they do not expand the scope for sustainable growth in activity and employment. ", " The relatively rapid increases in real wages during the current expansion seem to have reflected overly ambitious expectations by wage setters as to the increases that could be sustained in a low-inflation environment. By <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1997</span>there were signs that this situation was changing. Labour markets appeared to be responding to continued low inflation and weak employment demand with a slackening in the pace of aggregate wages growth, particularly in the private sector. Real wages also levelled out after the earlier period of growth. As discussed in detail below, wage outcomes in the September quarter cast doubt on that assessment, showing a strong rebound in aggregate wages growth. If sustained, that could pose significant risks to employment prospects. Although, in the near term, the labour market will benefit from the stronger growth in the economy now under way, resumption of a strong upward trend in real wages would tend to cut short the prospects for more rapid employment growth in the longer term. ", " The pace of financial intermediation has remained quite strong throughout the past two years. Annualised growth in the stock of <em>credit</em> provided by financial intermediaries to the private non-finance sector was <span class=\"no-wrap\">11.9 per cent</span> in the six months to September 1997, up from <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.7 per cent</span> in the previous six months. These rates of credit growth have remained well above the rate of increase in nominal GDP <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 24)</span>. ", " All three major types of credit have grown strongly (Table 8). Demand for housing finance has seen housing credit outstanding increase at about <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span> per annum, although this is well down on the rates of <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> or more at the peak of the housing upswing in 1993 and 1994. Personal credit and business credit have both picked up over the past six months, particularly the latter. ", " The community's gross holdings of monetary assets have increased in tandem with this expansion in credit. <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>Broad money</em></span> increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over the year to September, about the same as in the preceding <span class=\"no-wrap\">12-month</span> period. The more liquid part of the community's assets have increased more quickly, with M1 (mainly accounts with cheque facilities but low interest rates) increasing by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> over the past year. Demand for currency has also increased, with notes and coin in the hands of the public rising by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> over the past year, up from <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> in the preceding year. This acceleration in narrow measures of money is quite a common pattern in periods where interest rates decline, as the opportunity cost (in terms of <span class=\"no-wrap\">forgone interest)</span>of holding cash and low-yield cheque accounts declines. The rapid growth in M1 may also reflect ongoing innovation, where cheque facilities are increasingly offered in accounts which also have the characteristics of savings vehicles. Holdings in cash management trusts have increased strongly as well, rising by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 per cent</span> over the year to September. Although rates on instruments such as bank bills (the main determinant of cash management trust yields) have fallen, the flattening of the yield curve over the past couple of years has lessened the attractiveness of two- and three- year fixed deposits relative to yields of cash management trusts. Overall, the community's gross holdings of liquid assets have increased noticeably during the period of declining interest rates. ", " The adjustment to lower interest rates can also be seen in increased flows of funds into some other classes of assets. In addition to rapid growth in cash management trusts, listed property trusts and equity trusts also recorded significantly higher growth over the year to June 1997 than in either of the preceding two <span class=\"no-wrap\">12-month periods (Table 9)</span> although some of the increase in growth is likely to reflect rising asset values. ", " These data pre-date the recent instability in share markets. It remains to be seen to what extent those events affect the size and composition of these flows. Up to now, however, these financial portfolio changes by the private sector have illustrated well a part of the ‘transmission mechanism’ of monetary policy, whereby declines in short-term interest rates, if brought about by a credible policy regime, boost asset markets, and provide an environment conducive to ongoing investment activity. ", " While developments in Asia, and beyond, dominated very recent developments in capital markets in Australia, the setting of monetary policy was the main influence on movements in intermediaries' interest rates – the interest rates most likely to influence households' and businesses' decisions to borrow and spend. ", " For the reasons explained earlier, monetary policy has been eased in two steps since the previous Semi-Annual Statement, with the target for the cash rate reduced by a total of 1 percentage point to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span>. The monetary policy moves since July 1996 have reduced the cash rate by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ percentage</span> points from <span class=\"no-wrap\">7½ per cent (Graph 25)</span>. ", " Banks have reduced their borrowing and lending rates as a result of the latest two monetary easings, although in some cases not to the full extent of the fall in cash rates. Even so, interest rates on offer to household and business borrowers are below levels at the previous cyclical low in 1993/94. Interest rates on housing loans are at their lowest level since 1970, while those for business loans are at their lowest since 1973 (Graph 26). ", " The predominant indicator rate on <em>small business</em> variable-rate loans has been cut by the full percentage point reduction in the cash rate since May, to a level of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.75 per cent</span>. This is now 0.55 of a percentage point below its level in 1993/94.

Since the May easing, the predominant indicator rate on variable-rate loans to large businesses has fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.85 of a percentage point</span> to 8.45 per cent. Bank lending to large business is, however, concentrated in bill finance; bill yields have fallen in line with the cash rate.

Since May 1996, when banks began the process of reducing the margin on the standard housing product to meet the fierce competition from mortgage managers, this rate has fallen by 3.8 percentage points, 1.3 percentage points more than the reduction in the cash rate. ", " In addition to the standard variable-rate product, banks generally offer a wide range of housing loans, including basic (or ‘no frills’) loans at variable interest rates as well as ‘honeymoon’ and fixed-rate loans. Interest rates on ‘honeymoon’ loans and basic loans have generally been cut by 0.75–0.85 of a percentage point since May, whereas rates on fixed-rate loans, which reflect funding costs in longer-term capital markets, have fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.1–1.3</span> percentage points. ", " As was explained in the Bank's ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1997/aug/1.html\">Quarterly Report on the Economy and Financial Markets</a>’ published in the August <cite>Bulletin</cite>, most banks' decisions in May to reduce standard variable housing interest rates by less than the cash rate reflected several factors. One factor was the dynamics of the market for housing loans following the intense competition evident over the preceding year or more. Over that period, banks had cut housing interest rates by more than the cash rate had fallen. These additional reductions took banks' standard housing rates to around the level of rates charged by these institutions. As a result, banks had largely recovered their former market share by early in 1997, and therefore felt under less intense pressure to pass on to borrowers all of the May and July reductions in the cash rate. In the event, however, this action saw banks' market share fall away quickly again. ", " Another factor was that, while the cash rate is a reasonable guide to the cost of banks' funding in wholesale markets, their total cost of funds is also determined by costs of other sources of funds, such as for retail deposits. By May, interest rates paid on banks' retail deposits were already very low, leaving little room for them to fall further (Graph 27). The cost of retail funds was also held up by the delay in reducing interest rates paid on <span class=\"no-wrap\">so-called</span> deeming accounts – which reflect interest rates deemed by the Department of Social Security to be paid on pension recipients' bank accounts for taxation and welfare purposes. Deeming rates were not reduced until after the July easing, when they were cut by a percentage point, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> on large deposits and <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> on small deposits. In sum, the Bank estimates that banks' average cost of funds fell by a total 0.7 of a percentage point from the adjustment to deposit rates after the May and July easings, a result which is putting further downward pressure on banks' margins. Recent movements in banks' interest margins are set out in <a href=\"#box-e\">Box E</a>. ", " In response to the two cuts in cash rates since May, banks, on average, took about as long to reduce their interest rates on particular products as with the three previous easings in the second half of 1996; this is longer than it took banks to raise rates during the tightening phase of 1994. For housing loans, the average lag in passing on the cuts in cash rates has been over seven weeks; for small business, about five weeks. In both cases in 1994, the lag in raising rates was a little over two weeks (Table 10). ", " Consumer prices in underlying terms rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the September quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.5 per cent</span> over the year (Graph 28). On a year-ended basis the underlying inflation rate has fallen steadily from its most recent peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span>, reached in the March quarter of 1996. ", " The headline CPI continues to be affected by recent interest rate reductions which have held the headline inflation rate considerably below other measures. The September quarter figure was also reduced by the effect of rebates for health insurance introduced on 1 July, which are recorded as a reduction in the cost of premiums. Reflecting these factors, the headline CPI declined in the September quarter by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.4 per cent</span>, and by 0.3 per cent over the year. Mortgage interest rate reductions have detracted 1¾ percentage points from the movement in the CPI over the past year. ", " Falling import prices have for some time been contributing to the subdued underlying inflation results (Graph 29). This remained the case in the September quarter. The imported goods component of the CPI declined by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span> in the quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.5 per cent</span> over the year. The continuing declines in retail import prices reflect the gradual pass-through of the effects of earlier appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate, much of which took place over 1996. This effect can be expected to fade as the pass-through becomes more complete. The trade-weighted exchange rate has shown little further net movement over the past year, rising in the early part of this year before returning to around the levels of late 1996 in the middle part, then falling over recent weeks. Given the typically gradual nature of the pass-through into final prices, these shorter-term movements in the exchange rate over the past year are likely to have only relatively small effects on retail prices of imported goods in the period ahead. ", " Prices of domestically produced consumer goods have also been more subdued recently. They fell slightly in the September quarter and rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.8 per cent</span> over the year to September, continuing the general trend of deceleration evident in recent quarters (Graph 30). Strong competition from imported goods is likely to have contributed to this trend. In contrast, private-sector service price increases have picked up recently to be running at <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.6 per cent</span> over the latest year. ", " Producer prices have for much of the past two years shown less tendency to rise than underlying consumer prices. Over the year to December 1996, manufactured output prices increased by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span>, while building materials prices were similarly flat. More recently producer prices have been somewhat firmer, probably reflecting the stronger demand conditions in 1997, although their rate of increase to date remains moderate. Manufactured goods prices increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span> in the September quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span> over the year, while housing and non-residential building materials prices rose by 1.5 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.2 per cent</span> respectively over the year (Graph 31). Imported input prices showed a sharper pick-up in the September quarter, reflecting the recent exchange rate movements, but this followed substantial falls over the previous two years. ", " Recent developments in wages continue to be difficult to interpret. There have for some time been divergent trends between measures of private and public-sector wages, and to a lesser extent between aggregate wage measures and more specialised indicators of bargaining outcomes. The picture has been further complicated by large fluctuations in the estimates of aggregate wages growth in the two latest quarters. ", " All measures of average earnings compiled in the Average Weekly Earnings survey showed a sharp jump in the three months to August. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE), the measure which should be least affected by changes in average hours worked and compositional changes, increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span> in the quarter. This followed a rise of <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the previous three months (Graph 32). The other measures showed a broadly similar pattern. Taking the results at face value, and averaging the increases in AWOTE over the two quarters, they suggest that aggregate wages have continued to rise at around one per cent per quarter, about the same pace that has been evident for the past two years. Over the year to August they increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.1 per cent</span>. Flow-through of the recent safety-net decision will have contributed to the August outcome although the effect is relatively small. ", " Notwithstanding the flat trend in aggregate AWOTE growth, there has, at least until recently, been a decline in growth of the private sector component, offset by unusually high outcomes in the public sector. Over the year to May (the latest period for which data are available at the disaggregated level) public-sector AWOTE increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.2 per cent</span>. This figure remains well above the increases applying under currently active enterprise agreements in the public sector, and seems likely to reflect compositional changes in the public-sector workforce associated with ongoing restructuring. The increase in private-sector AWOTE over the year to May was <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.5 per cent</span>, having declined substantially from the peak of over <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> reached in 1995. ", " While the recent figures are difficult to interpret, it seems clear that this trend decline in private-sector wage growth has now come to an end, and that the figure for the year to May overstates the extent of the trend decline. If the aggregate wage outcomes for the three months to August are at all representative for the private sector, they imply a significant rebound in that sector's annual wage growth; what is not yet clear is its extent. For the sake of illustration, applying the aggregate quarterly increase in the three months to August equally to both sectors would imply a rise in annual private-sector earnings growth to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ per cent</span>. These results must be considered disappointing in an environment where underlying consumer price inflation is running at <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span>, producer price increases are running at a similar rate, and demand for labour has been flat. ", " Wage increases negotiated under enterprise agreements have continued to yield increases of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> on average, about the same rate that has prevailed for the past year (Graph 33). While there has been no general tendency for these increases to ease in the face of lower inflation and the weaker labour market, there is some evidence of increasing diversity of outcomes in response to differing conditions across industries. Wage pressures have been relatively strong in the construction sector, where skill shortages have emerged in line with strengthening activity. Construction agreements reported annualised increases of <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.1 per cent</span> in the June quarter. These pressures appear to have continued in the second half of the year. In contrast, wage outcomes in the metals and finance industries have eased a little during the past year, although they remain high. ", " Growth of executive salaries, as reported in the Cullen, Egan and Dell survey, remains stubbornly high at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span>, little changed from the rates of increase that have been reported for the past two years. These increases seem increasingly unrelated to trends in business conditions, particularly given the weakness of selling prices over the past year and the pronounced slowing of profit growth. ", " Award wages are now feeling the effect of the flow-through of the recent safety-net decision, which increased awards by $10 a week, equivalent to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1¾ per cent</span> for workers on average award wages. Much of this increase is likely to have been paid in the September quarter. The ACTU has now foreshadowed an additional claim, which is likely to be heard early next year. The claim seeks in its initial stage to increase all award wages by a flat dollar amount of $20.60 a week, which represents a <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.7 per cent</span> increase for those on the minimum award but a smaller proportionate rise for those on higher awards. The claim also contains a second stage which aims for an additional $38 increase in the subsequent year. ", " On most measures inflation expectations are close to historic lows, having declined substantially in the early part of the 1990s and generally undergoing a further downward shift in the past year. The general pattern has been that expectations have tended to follow trends in actual inflation with a lag, and, as a track record of low inflation has been built up during the 1990s, this has been increasingly taken into the public's expectations. Recognition of the low inflation environment may have been reinforced by the fact that the most recent period of rising inflation, in 1994/95, was successfully resisted and that inflation has subsequently fallen. On some indicators, however, expectations of inflation remain higher than actual rates, and higher than the target. ", " Consumers' inflation expectations, as measured by the Melbourne Institute's monthly survey, moved down in late 1996 and have subsequently remained at around their new lower level (Graph 34). The October survey reported an expected inflation rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 per cent</span>, representing the average expected increase in the Consumer Price Index over the year ahead. Results for this survey during the past year have generally fluctuated in the 3 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ per cent</span> range, around a percentage point lower than the average that had prevailed over the previous couple of years. ", " Medium-term inflation expectations of business respondents have shown quite a similar pattern to the results of the consumer survey. The NAB Survey recorded a sizeable downward shift in medium-term inflation expectations during 1996, but little further change over the past year. Like consumers, business respondents typically expect inflation to be slightly above the target, with the most common response being in the 3 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> range. ", " Near-term price expectations of producers have remained low in recent months and seem to show little impact from the current strengthening in demand conditions. In this sense they give a somewhat more subdued picture of price pressures than the recent results for producer price increases discussed above. According to the NAB business survey, retailers expect to increase their selling prices by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span> in the December quarter, following average quarterly increases of <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.4 per cent</span> according to the same survey in the first three quarters of the year. Manufacturers have generally held weaker price expectations than other industries for some time. The latest <span class=\"no-wrap\">ACCI-Westpac</span> survey of manufacturing businesses, taken in September/October, suggests flat prices, with roughly equal numbers of businesses expecting prices to rise as to fall in the December quarter. ", " Expectations of financial market participants, as indicated both by surveys and by market-based indicators, have been declining during the past year. In contrast to business and consumer survey results, they are also at levels consistent with the inflation target. A long-term market based indicator, the indexed bond yield differential, currently implies an expected average inflation rate over the next ten years of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. This indicator has been declining steadily for some time, in line with nominal bond yields, and is about a percentage point below the levels that were typical a year ago. A survey of financial market participants conducted by the Bank points to continued downward revisions of their near-term inflation forecasts over the past year. Economists surveyed immediately after the September quarter CPI release returned a median forecast of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.9 per cent</span> for underlying inflation over the year to June 1998, having been forecasting a <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.9 per cent</span> underlying rate a year <span class=\"no-wrap\">earlier (Table 11)</span>. ", " In the near term, the climate remains favourable to a continuation of the low rates of inflation seen over the past year. Notwithstanding the pick-up in growth that is currently under way, the economy still has ample capacity to satisfy expanding demand, and price expectations are generally low. At its current rate of growth, the economy is likely to be absorbing surplus capacity at only a moderate pace which would not generate the sorts of bottlenecks that accompanied the very rapid phase of the current expansion in 1994/95. Producers and retailers still report that they expect only very modest price increases in the December quarter. ", " Given these circumstances the prospects are that inflation will remain below <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the near future. Looking further ahead, however, there are signs that the trend reduction in inflation, which has reduced the underlying rate from over <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> to <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> over the past two years, may be close to having run its course. The inflation reduction has resulted from three main factors: a significant slowing in the rate of growth of demand and output, particularly in 1996; appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate, which rose by nearly <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over the same year; and a decline in growth of average wages, particularly in the private sector, over a two-year period running to around the middle of 1997. Prospects in all three areas are for a smaller restraining impact on domestic prices in the period ahead. ", " As discussed above, the path of the exchange rate has exerted an important influence on recent inflationary trends. To date, the main impact has come from the sharp appreciation that occurred during 1996. The <span class=\"no-wrap\">pass-through</span> of these effects to retail prices has been sufficiently gradual that the contribution of imported goods prices to the CPI by the September quarter 1997 was still negative, and there may be some further price reductions still to flow through. Nonetheless the overall effects of Australia's earlier currency appreciation will soon fade or begin to be offset by more recent, although smaller, movements in the other direction. In net terms the contribution of import prices to underlying inflation can be expected to shift from a negative to a broadly neutral position over the year ahead. ", " The restraining influence from domestic demand conditions evident over the past couple of years is also likely to become weaker. The economy is now growing at or close to trend after a period of slower growth that undoubtedly contributed to restraint of domestic prices. With monetary policy now in an expansionary setting, a continuation of the current stronger growth is in prospect. That in turn will mean that the cyclical forces that helped to bring the inflation rate below the target will, over time, be lessened. ", " With temporary exchange rate effects and cyclical factors having less of an influence, recorded rates of inflation can be expected to be a little higher over the year ahead as longer-term domestic forces reassert themselves. After a period of below <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> inflation, the inflation rate is expected to move back within the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> range, probably towards the end of 1998. ", " An important determinant of the trend in inflation will be the extent of any pick-up in domestic labour costs. In this regard recent developments have been less encouraging than had appeared likely a few months ago. The strong figure for earnings growth in the September quarter, while most likely an overstatement of ongoing wages growth, does suggest that the downward trend in private-sector wages growth has probably come to an end. On the latest reading, which is subject to considerable uncertainty, private wages appear to be growing at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ per cent</span>, and economy-wide wages at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. Wage increases at around these levels would appear consistent with the inflation target although, as noted earlier, the implied rate of increase in real wages is likely to be unhelpful to prospects for employment growth. ", "The <em>standard variable housing rate</em> loan has fallen by 3.8 percentage points over the period, which is 1.3 percentage points more than the fall in the cash rate, implying a sharp contraction in margins; this is also evident, though to a lesser extent, for <em>basic</em> housing loans. This reflects the increase in competition in the housing loan market, spurred on by the growth of mortgage managers. Against this, rates on <em>honeymoon</em> loans have fallen by less than the cash rate, as banks have pulled back from these types of loans.", "The indicator rates on small business <em>overdrafts</em> and <em>term</em> loans have fallen broadly in line with the cash rate, consistent with these margins remaining steady. However, as the interest rate on term loans is lower than for overdrafts, there has been some shift out of overdrafts into term loans. Banks have also introduced new products such as overdrafts and term loans secured by equity in residential property. The rate on <em>residential-secured overdrafts</em> has fallen by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 percentage</span> points more than the cash rate, as banks have come to recognise more explicitly the quality of security supporting business loans. As a result of the growing popularity of these new products, average interest received across all variable-rate small business loans has fallen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 percentage points</span> since mid 1996. This is larger than the fall in the cash rate, though this trend has only become apparent in the latest preliminary figures for the September quarter 1997.", "In the case of large business loans, the indicator rate for <em>overdrafts</em> has fallen by slightly less than the cash rate while the indicator rate for term loans has fallen by a little more. Overall, the preliminary figures for the September quarter 1997 suggest that the overall interest rate on loans to large businesses has fallen by slightly more than the cash rate since mid 1996.", " Over the past six months, bond yields in Australia have continued to fall relative to those in other countries, as markets have become more accepting of the sustainability of Australia's low inflation (Graph A1). While the improvement has been evident against the broad range of countries, the key market against which Australian yields are judged is the US. ", " The spread between Australian 10-year bond yields and corresponding US yields has fallen to an average of about 10 basis points in recent months. The fall in this spread continues the trend evident for much of the 1990s, the abrupt setback during the bear market of 1994 aside: in the second half of the 1980s, the spread of 10-year bonds in Australia to US treasuries averaged about 4.5 percentage points (Graph A2). ", " The sharp narrowing of the spread, to the point where it has almost closed, has occurred because Australia's better inflation performance relative to the US in the 1990s <span class=\"no-wrap\">(2.7 per cent</span> a year versus <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 per cent)</span> is working to offset other factors which would normally result in a premium for Australian yields over US yields. These include Australia's lower credit standing and the lesser liquidity of the Australian bond market. ", " Differences in the cyclical position of the Australian and US economies have also contributed to the narrowing of spreads over the past year or so. The US economy is further advanced in its economic cycle, and therefore likely to be closer to experiencing upward pressure on inflation and monetary tightening, factors which would be helping to lift bond yields there relative to those in Australia. ", " Much of the yield curve in Australia has moved to a position below that in the United States in recent months (Graph A3). In mid 1996, before the latest easing in inflation and wage pressures, the yield curve in Australia was well above that in the United States at all maturities. ", " As well as domestic considerations, the narrowing of the bond spread reflects the international setting: most countries' spreads to the US have narrowed (Table A1). Australia's performance should be assessed against those of other previously high inflation countries, such as Italy and Spain, which have also done about as well. Apart from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Sweden – on the high side – and Japan and Switzerland – on the low side – most industrial countries' bond yields are currently in a band around 5.5 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.0 per cent</span>. The main factor in this convergence is that inflation is universally low, although progress in reducing budget deficits in most countries, including Australia, has also helped. ", " Acknowledging the progress of other countries does not diminish the benefits that have flowed to the local bond market as a result of the return to low inflation in Australia. While bond spreads will no doubt continue to fluctuate, Australia's record on inflation in the 1990s, good prospects that this performance will be sustained and the program of Budget consolidation have put Australia in a much better position to withstand market pressures on bond yields that may arise from time to time. ", " The structural decline in inflation in Australia during the 1990s has allowed a major decline in interest rates. The fall in interest rates for home borrowers has been particularly marked, due to the additional effect of increased competition in the housing loan market. As a result, housing loan rates are now well below their low points reached in the early 1990s, when the economy was much weaker than at present, and are at levels last seen in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ", " Quite important implications have flowed from this structural change. The first is that the ‘affordability’ of housing has increased considerably. Servicing costs on a standard variable-rate loan relative to average household disposable income have fallen sharply, and are currently lower than at any time since housing loan rates were deregulated in the mid 1980s (Graph B1, upper panel). It would be possible to find periods prior to deregulation when the servicing costs for the standard loan were lower than at present, but that is not a relevant comparison since loans were much less widely available (at least from banks) and borrowers often needed to take out more than one loan in order to fund a house purchase. Hence, it is safe to conclude that the accessibility of housing finance has increased markedly over the 1990s. It is likely that this change, other things equal, will prove to be of considerable advantage to low-income earners. ", " Households are tending, in many instances, to use the decline in interest costs to service much larger loans. The average size of new loans approved to owner occupiers has increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">60 per cent</span> since 1990, and is now about 2½ times average annual household income (Graph B1, lower panel). It is also likely that more households have loans, though there are no timely data which measure that directly (and in fact, as of 1995/96, the majority of households were not paying off a housing loan, either owning their home outright or renting). The repayment burden would have fallen much further in the absence of this increase in loan size.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnb1\" id=\"rb1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> It is also likely that in some areas, the lower interest rates and larger loans are serving to accommodate upward pressure on house prices, though that is not widespread at this <span class=\"no-wrap\">stage (see main text)</span>. ", " These trends have lifted the levels of gross debt carried by the household sector considerably. For the purposes of making international comparisons, it is necessary to add other personal loans and loans to unincorporated businesses. Data compiled on this basis are shown in Graph B2. Until recently, Australian households and unincorporated businesses carried relatively little debt compared with those in other developed countries. As of 1996, Australia was closer to the median for this group of countries. As such, the present level of debt is not a major concern, though its current rate of increase (of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent)</span> is unlikely to be sustainable indefinitely in an economy where growth of nominal incomes is of the order of <span class=\"no-wrap\">5–6 per cent</span>. ", " The first <cite>Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, published in May this year, compared growth in labour and total-factor productivity in the current economic expansion with their growth in the corresponding phase of the two previous business cycles. The data presented showed growth in labour productivity in the current expansion to be substantially stronger than in the 1980s expansion, but weaker than in the 1970s. By contrast, growth in total-factor productivity – which is a more comprehensive measure of the efficiency with which <em>all</em> inputs in the economy are combined to produce output – was shown to be stronger in the current expansion than in either of the previous two expansions.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnc1\" id=\"rc1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> This was taken as evidence that the extensive structural changes in the economy over the past decade appeared to have led to an improvement in Australia's underlying rate of productivity growth. ", " This box updates the results presented six months ago. The addition of two more quarters of data, as well as revisions to the latest national accounts, now imply a larger increase in total-factor productivity growth than previously reported.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnc2\" id=\"rc2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> ", " There is some cyclical variation in measures of both labour and total-factor productivity; when comparing productivity performances between economic cycles, it is therefore appropriate to measure productivity over common phases of the cycle. With the current expansion having now run for six years since the trough in output in June 1991, a comparison of recent productivity growth with that in the previous two business cycles can be conducted on a comparable basis by measuring productivity over the six years from successive troughs in output. On this basis, trend labour productivity growth in the current expansion is still estimated to have been weaker than in the 1970s expansion, but significantly stronger than in the 1980s <span class=\"no-wrap\">expansion (Table C1)</span>. ", " The changing capital intensity of the economy explains some of the differences in labour productivity between business cycle expansions. Labour productivity growth was boosted in the 1970s as businesses tended to substitute capital for labour following the large increase in real wages. In the 1980s expansion, hours worked grew more rapidly than the capital stock in a climate of real wage restraint. When adjustments are made for these changes in capital and labour inputs by calculating total-factor productivity, a slightly different picture emerges. Total-factor productivity grew at trend rates of 1.2 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.8 per cent</span> in the first two expansions; in the 1990s expansion, it is estimated to have grown significantly faster at a trend rate of 1.6 per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph C1)</span>. ", " The Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes an estimate of employment in Australia each month, based on the Labour Force Survey in which 30,000 people are interviewed. The survey consists of eight sub-samples of roughly equal size. Each month, one of the sub-samples is rotated out of the survey and replaced by a new group of respondents, leaving seven sub-samples common to the survey in consecutive months. These seven common sub-samples, or cohorts, constitute the ‘matched sample’. ", " The <em>level</em> of employment in Australia each month is estimated most reliably using the full sample of respondents to the Labour Force Survey. By contrast, month-to-month <em>changes</em> in employment can be estimated more reliably using the matched sample. This is because the differences in employment experience <em>between</em> cohorts at any one time are much bigger than the changes in employment experience which occur in the typical month <em>within</em> a cohort. Hence, the change in the published employment figure between two adjacent months can be strongly influenced by the differences between the employment level characterising the cohort newly introduced into the sample and that in the cohort being rotated out. The matched sample eliminates this source of variability, and therefore provides a clearer signal of employment changes over short periods; over longer periods, these sources of variability do not matter as much because the random variations cancel out. ", " The matched-sample results can be derived from gross-flows data from the Labour Force Survey by calculating net flows into employment in those sub-samples common to successive surveys. To obtain estimates of changes in employment that can be compared with those from the full sample, a number of adjustments to the gross flows data need to be made.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnd1\" id=\"rd1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> In the approach used here, the results are first scaled up to allow for the smaller size of the matched sample. Second, the matched sample data are independently seasonally adjusted, since the seasonal pattern of the matched and full samples differs somewhat. Finally, a constant is added to ensure that average monthly employment growth since 1980 is equal in two samples.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnd2\" id=\"rd2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> This avoids a slight tendency of understatement stemming from the implicit assumption of zero population growth in the matched sample results, and also allows for any systematic difference in individuals' responses when they are surveyed for the first and subsequent times. ", " Estimates of employment growth from the matched sample developed, as described above, are compared in Graph D1 with estimates from the published employment data. Although the two estimates tend to move together over the medium term, they can differ from one another over short periods. The matched sample estimates of employment growth were weaker than the published series in late 1996 and early 1997, presaging a weakening in the published series later in 1997. More recently, the matched sample estimates have been suggesting a modest pick-up in employment growth. ", " The Bank monitors movements in banks' interest rate spreads – i.e. the difference between the average interest rate <em>received</em> and the average interest rate <em>paid</em> – from a variety of information supplied by banks. The most comprehensive data are from banks' published financial statements, though these are at a very aggregated level and available only half-yearly, with a lag. The Bank also collects, on a quarterly basis, data on the average interest rate received on business loans, together with ongoing data on indicator lending rates. These provide more timely, though less comprehensive, information. ", " Graph E1 plots data on the average spread of the four major banks for the period up to the first half of 1997, the latest period for which annual report data are available. The overall spread has declined significantly during the period since deregulation, from <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.0 per cent</span> in 1980 to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 per cent</span>. Since the mid 1980s, the graph also plots the spread on performing assets. The gap between this and the overall spread reflects the impact of non-performing loans. This was most significant in the early 1990s, when the spread on performing loans rose a little while the overall spread declined. As bad loans ran off over 1993 and 1994, the overall spread recovered, and banks responded by reducing the spread on performing loans. With that period of adjustment over, a clear downward trend in both measures of the spread has resumed since 1994. ", " An indication of what factors have been driving the change in the spread can be gained by comparing its two components – the average interest rate <em>received</em> and the average interest rate <em>paid</em> – to the cash rate. Over the period since mid 1996, as monetary policy has been eased, the average interest rate <em>received</em> by banks has fallen broadly in line with the cash rate. As discussed below, however, this average masks a divergent pattern among different loan products. The average interest rate <em>paid</em>, in contrast, has fallen by considerably less than the cash rate – hence the reduction in overall spreads. ", " As can be seen in Graph E2, over a long run of years, the relationship between average rates of interest paid and received, on the one hand, and the cash rate, on the other, is only a loose one. In particular, the cycle in the average interest rates on loans and deposits is less pronounced than that in the cash rate. The cash rate only provides an indication of the rates paid by banks for wholesale deposits. It can be thought of as a measure of banks' <em>marginal</em> cost of funds. The greater stability in banks' <em>average</em> interest rates reflects two main factors: in addition to funds raised in wholesale markets, banks also offer retail deposits where interest rates do not vary much; and they also have a sizeable proportion of deposits and loans at fixed rates on which interest rates change only on roll-over, rather than when the cash rate changes. ", " As noted, not all interest rates on loans have fallen in line with the cash rate: some have fallen by more and some by less. This is illustrated in Tables E1 and E2, which show the net change since the June quarter 1996, the period during which monetary policy has been eased, in a variety of indicator lending rates and, where available, the change in the average overall interest rates paid. ", " Table E1 shows movements in interest rates on various types of variable-rate loans. The points to note from the table are as follows: ", " Interest rates on bill lines have moved in line with the cash rate, as they are priced directly off yields in the money market. ", " Interest rates on fixed-rate loans are priced off capital market interest rates of relevant maturities, rather than the cash rate. Table E2 shows movements for 3-year fixed-rate loans and the movement in their funding cost, proxied by the 3-year rate in swap markets. For small and large business loans, the change in the average interest rate received on all existing fixed-rate loans outstanding is also shown. ", " <em>Indicator</em> rates have fallen broadly in line with the swap rate since mid 1996. However, the average interest rate received on all <em>existing</em> business fixed-rate loans has fallen by less than the swap rate. The smaller fall in the overall interest rate received than in the indicator rates for new loans reflects the fact that the latter have not yet worked their way through the stock of existing loans. Of course, on the deposit side, banks would be experiencing a corresponding phenomenon – i.e. the average cost at which existing fixed-rate loans are being funded has not yet fully reflected the recent falls in interest rates. As noted earlier, during periods of falling interest rates, these adjustment lags work to hold up both the average interest rate received and the average interest rate paid; during periods of rising interest rates, they work in the opposite direction. ", " In summary, banks' interest margins have narrowed over the past 18 months or so as monetary policy has been eased. Their overall deposit costs have not fallen in line with the cash rate, due importantly to the limited scope to further reduce retail deposit interest rates. At the same time, competition has nonetheless forced loan rates lower. This competition was first evident in the housing loan market, particularly from mid 1996 reflecting the expansion of mortgage managers into this market. It has now started to flow through into small business loan rates, as reduced housing margins have forced banks to look to increase market share in other areas. This process has resulted in banks introducing a range of new small business products offering discounted interest rates and better reflecting the type of security being offered. Until recently, the effects of this competition in small business finance were not evident in banks' aggregate figures on interest received, suggesting that the switch to lower priced products was only gradual. But the latest numbers from the major banks, which remain preliminary, are starting to show a more significant impact. ", " This competition should continue, though it is unlikely that margins on small business loans will fall to the same level as those on housing, due both to the higher risk on small business lending and to the greater difficulty new lenders are likely to face in contesting this market.

{"Date": ["Reserve Bank Bulletin – February 1999"], "Section": [" ", " The Economy and Financial Markets "], "Text": ["<p id=\"introduction\"> The growth performance of the Australian economy exceeded most expectations in 1998. In a year in which growth in the world economy halved, and in which the economies of many of Australia's trading partners experienced large outright contractions, Australia's GDP grew, according to the latest data, at above its trend rate. ", " It was not possible, however, to avoid altogether the effects of the weaker regional and global environment. Despite some success in finding new markets, Australia's export volumes are well down on their level in mid 1997, and the terms of trade have declined. Both these factors have contributed to a widening of the current account deficit. Domestic expenditure, however, rose at such a pace that the economy recorded strong GDP growth. This has resulted in a further decline in unused capacity in the economy, and a fall in the rate of unemployment. ", " At the time of the <cite>Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> in November, the Bank's expectation was that signs of a decline in growth, of which there were few at that time, would begin to emerge before long. Three months later, such signs are still relatively few. If anything, the bulk of recent information suggests a continuation of quite robust growth, and a resurgence in business and household confidence towards the end of 1998. ", " Internationally, the main feature over recent months has been the exceptional strength of the US economy. Despite the clear weakness in the manufacturing sector, the US economy overall continues to grow at an <span class=\"no-wrap\">above-trend rate</span>. Concerns over the possibility of an imminent credit squeeze and resulting economic downturn in the US, which dominated world financial markets generally in the third quarter of 1998, have receded since late last year. Since October, world share markets have rallied, currency and bond markets have generally become less volatile, and liquidity in developed countries' financial markets has improved, all aided by further easings of monetary policy in a number of countries. A new major currency, the euro, was also launched successfully in the wholesale foreign exchange market, replacing ten European currencies. Some elements of vulnerability remain, particularly in Brazil where pressures came to a head in mid January, forcing the authorities to float the exchange rate and tighten monetary policy as the currency depreciated. ", " Outside the United States, however, economic conditions generally are weak. Progress in re-starting growth in Japan is slow, and growth in parts of Europe appeared to weaken a little in the second half of 1998. In east Asia, economic activity in most of the countries worst affected by the currency and banking crises has stopped falling. The emergence of growth in this region is more likely than further contraction in the year ahead, but the assumption must still be that this will be rather tentative. Economic activity in Latin America is at risk of a sharp decline, resulting from the pressure exerted on Brazil by capital flight, and the flow-on effects of this to neighbouring countries. Most forecasts of global growth see little if any acceleration in 1999 at this stage. On this basis, a fairly difficult external environment for Australia must be assumed, with some resultant decline in Australia's growth the likely outcome. As noted above, however, this result appears to be occurring rather later than formerly thought. ", " Inflation remains lower than forecast. For some time, the Bank has expected that the combination of a strongly growing economy and a depreciating exchange rate would lead to some pick-up in the rate of inflation. These impulses usually take some time to flow through to the consumer, but the rise in wholesale import prices already observed suggested that such effects should have been expected towards the end of 1998 and into 1999. As was noted in the November <em>Statement</em>, however, there was always a possibility that, in the current circumstances, historical experience might not be an accurate guide to outcomes over the coming year. The most recent price data suggest that this is the case, with overall inflation remaining well below 2 per cent over the latest 12-month period. ", " A key question is whether such a situation is likely to be persistent or temporary. The breakdown in the normal relationship between the change in the exchange rate, wholesale import prices and consumer import prices suggests that profitability of wholesalers or retailers or both has declined. It raises the question of whether such a decline could be permanent, or whether the margins will soon be partly or wholly restored with consequent effects on the final prices for imported goods. While it is possible that there will be no move towards the restoration of margins, and hence no effect on final goods prices, this seems an unlikely outcome for a depreciation that has been as long-lasting as the current one. In the Bank's view, it is more likely to be a case of delay, with some effects on final prices coming through over the next 12 months. Even if the issue of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">pass-through</span> of the depreciation into final prices were to be resolved, there is still the equally difficult task of forecasting the underlying world rate of inflation. Over the past year or so, most countries have experienced very low inflation, in many instances well below earlier forecasts. It is unlikely that the current rate of inflation among industrial countries of around 1 per cent will fall further in the year ahead, but it is possible. ", " On balance, the outlook over the next year or so at this stage is for inflation to remain quite low. The Bank expects underlying inflation to increase gradually, on the assumption that there will be <em>some</em> effect due to higher import prices. Our present forecast is that it will reach 2 per cent by the end of 1999. Inflation as recorded by the CPI is likely to remain noticeably below 2 per cent, as the effect of the implementation of the Government's health insurance rebate will be to reduce the CPI. For the purposes of evaluating inflation relative to the target, the Bank will ‘look through’ that effect, just as it would ordinarily abstract from other one-time movements in prices resulting from government policy initiatives. In this regard, it is worth recording that the Bank intends to treat similarly the direct impact on the CPI of the proposed GST. ", " The conjuncture of unexpectedly good growth driven by strong domestic demand, albeit still with some expectation of a slowing in the year ahead, and lower-than-expected inflation, is unusual and makes for a slightly more complex decision process for monetary policy than is normally the case. There is a clear case for monetary policy to be relatively easy, and policy has maintained an expansionary stance over the past year and a half, as the international environment has turned unfavourable for Australia. Late in 1998, as the balance of risks appeared to be moving in the direction of greater international weakness, policy eased a little further, with the cash rate falling by 25 basis points to 4.75 per cent. This was followed by a fall in the exchange rate, which reached a low of US60.8 cents late in December, before rising on the back of stronger economic data and a firming in some commodity prices, which reduced market expectations of further easing. ", " The Bank's judgment is that the current stance of policy remains appropriate for the likely state of the economy over the coming year though, as always, policy will be continually reviewed in the light of incoming information. The period during which inflation has been below the 2–3 per cent target has proved to be longer than had been expected, but it is important to emphasise that the target is a <em>medium-term</em> one. It is designed to avoid the potential which would exist for instability in both the real economy and the financial sector were monetary policy to attempt to fine-tune the short-run path of prices. In the period ahead, the current policy setting will, in the Bank's view, provide support to growth and result in a limited and gradual drift upward in inflation to rates consistent with the target. ", " As explained in the November <cite>Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, conditions in world financial markets, including in the United States, deteriorated sharply in the third quarter of 1998 after the Russian government defaulted on its debt in August, substantially raising the risk premium on emerging market debt. In response to this market disorder, and to limit its effects on the US economy, the Federal Reserve reduced the Fed funds rate from 5.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent in three cuts of 0.25 percentage points on 29 September, <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 October and 17 November (Graph 1)</span>. As markets settled, the Fed shifted its monetary policy bias in November from easing to neutral. ", " Most other central banks in industrial countries also cut interest rates towards the end of 1998. In Europe, the downward movement was reinforced by the short-term interest rate convergence for Stage Three of European economic and monetary union on 1 January. Through the last quarter, countries with above-average rates moved down towards those of Germany and others at the bottom of the range, and late in the quarter all countries <span class=\"no-wrap\">cut rates (Graph 2)</span>. The market had expected interest rates to converge at 3.3 per cent, and the surprise <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> cut in core European rates was directed at supporting economic activity and financial markets in the face of recent financial turbulence. Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada also cut their benchmark interest rates in the past few months. ", " The easings of monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere were effective in stopping the deterioration in market conditions, which had been evident in the large widening in credit spreads (Graph 3). Liquidity has been returning to markets, albeit gradually, and volatility in most debt markets has declined. European bond markets quietened considerably ahead of conversion to the euro on 1 January. ", " The US share market rallied strongly, reaching new records in response to the easier monetary policy and to signs that economic activity was remaining stronger than earlier expected (Graph 4). Following the US lead, share markets in most other developed countries also rose. The devaluation and subsequent float of the Brazilian <em>real</em> in mid January and associated concerns about US and European bank exposures to Latin America had only a temporarily negative impact on share markets around the world. ", " Bond and share markets in Japan did not follow the trends in the other major markets. Japanese bonds have become particularly volatile in recent months, with yields on the 10-year benchmark bond jumping from an historic low of 0.68 per cent in mid September to over 2 per cent in early February, levels last seen in July 1997. The catalysts for this sharp correction were the downgrading of Japan's credit rating and a general concern about the ability of the market to digest substantially larger bond issues to finance budget deficits of close to 10 per cent of GDP in coming years. The Japanese share market initially rallied throughout October and November, albeit to a lesser extent than other world share markets, but lost these gains in December over concerns about the domestic economy. ", " Foreign exchange markets have also stabilised after the unprecedented movements in the US dollar-yen exchange rate in early October. The new European currency, the euro, which replaced ten European currencies, was introduced on 1 January without incident. The rates at which member countries' currencies were to be converted to the euro were announced on 31 December, taking effect from 1 January (Table 1). ", " The euro started trading at the value of one euro to US$1.174 and, while it initially appreciated, it has since weakened slightly to trade around US$1.13. The yen was more stable than in early October, and appreciated further in December and January in response to lower US interest rates and Japan's continuing trade surplus. ", " Developments in emerging markets have been much more mixed over the past few months, with Brazil remaining the main focus. ", " On 13 November, the IMF announced that it had reached agreement with Brazil on a US$41.5 billion restructuring package, requiring Brazil to move quickly from budget deficits to surpluses. The package differed from other recent IMF packages in that it aimed to prevent a crisis from developing, rather than responding to a crisis which had already occurred with, consequently, substantial funds available up front. Conditionality was also more finely honed to the problem at hand: fiscal imbalance. ", " In the lead up to, and immediately following, this package, capital outflows slowed, but they accelerated in January after Brazil's third most economically important state, Minas Gerais, announced that it would suspend debt payments to the federal government for three months, raising doubts about the ability of Brazil to meet its fiscal austerity plan. With foreign reserves around US$40 billion, net outflows in excess of US$1 billion a day were unsustainable and, on 13 January, the Brazilian central bank widened the trading band for the <em>real</em> against <span class=\"no-wrap\">the US dollar</span>, effectively devaluing the currency by 9 per cent. Market participants regarded this as inadequate, and outflows continued, leading the authorities to float the <em>real</em> on 15 January. In net terms, the <em>real</em> has now depreciated by almost 35 per cent against the US dollar since early January. ", " Share prices in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America fell substantially at first, but then rallied strongly following the float, even though interest rates have risen further in Brazil as the central bank tightened monetary policy to support the currency. Risk premiums also rose immediately in Latin America, although not, for the most part, in other emerging markets (Graph 5). On the whole, markets in east Asia have not been much affected by the Brazilian crisis. The impact on Russia was greater, where economic fundamentals and financial prices had been continuing to weaken and the government had defaulted on additional debt in December. ", " The direct effect of the Brazilian turmoil on east Asia was limited since economic fundamentals in most of emerging east Asia have firmed in recent months, capital flight had already taken place in 1997 and early 1998, and current accounts are strongly in surplus. Markets in Korea have been doing particularly well, with share prices and the <em>won</em> rising by 37 and 12 per cent respectively from the end of October to early February. In recent months, Asian interest rates have continued to fall. ", " Late in 1998, expectations about monetary policy dominated activity in local money and capital markets. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Short-term</span> market yields in Australia had been consistent with some expectation of an easing in monetary policy in Australia since around the time that the Federal Reserve eased interest rates in the United States in <span class=\"no-wrap\">September 1998;</span> at that time, yields in local short-term markets moved somewhat below the then cash rate target of <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> (Graph 6). When the Bank announced its easing of monetary policy in December, the yield on 90-day bills moved to around the new level of the cash rate of 4.75 per cent; and yields in futures trading priced in expectations of a further reduction in the cash rate by mid 1999. Longer-term interest rates also moved lower on the announced easing, the yield on 10-year bonds moving to a low of 4.72 per cent by mid December, a level which could only be sustained if short-term rates were to fall further. At this rate, bond yields in Australia were at their lowest since July 1964. ", " By January, however, as evidence came to hand of continuing robust economic growth in <span class=\"no-wrap\">the US and Australian economies</span>, the earlier expectations of further reductions in short-term interest rates were reversed. By late January, yields on 90-day bank bills and in futures trading were around 4.75 per cent – i.e. consistent with the current cash rate – while the yield on 10-year bonds rose to 5.25 per cent (Graph 7). Notwithstanding these reversals, money and capital market rates in Australia remain very low by historical standards, as does the structure of intermediaries' interest rates (see below). ", " The rise in bond yields in Australia in recent months was more than in the United States, so that the spread to <span class=\"no-wrap\">US Treasuries</span> moved up to about 35 basis points by late January. The fact that Australia has continued to grow more quickly than most other industrial countries was reflected in widening spreads on bond yields with these countries (Table 2), especially with expectations of further easing in monetary policy in the euro area, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United Kingdom and Canada</span>. The exception to this trend was Japan, where bond yields rose very strongly, from their historical lows. ", " Over recent months the Australian share market rose strongly, although not as much as the US market. The market reached a new high in early February, about 18 per cent above its low point at the time of world financial market disturbance around September. The market was buoyed by strong domestic economic data and the reduction in interest rates in early December. As has been the case for some time in Australia, banks and large industrial stocks showed the biggest rises in price, while resource stocks fell further in response to lower commodity prices globally. ", " From its historic lows of about US55 cents in August, the Australian dollar rose to a high of US64.5 cents in mid November. This was driven by the unwinding of short positions by hedge funds who were forced to cut back on their risk-taking after the losses they incurred in Russia and elsewhere over August/September. Thereafter, the exchange rate started to fall again as expectations of a monetary policy easing grew in late November, and it continued to decline following the easing in early December. By year's end, the dollar had fallen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> from its November high, to US60.8 cents. Subsequently, the strengthening in US economic data and in some commodity prices, together with solid Australian data, saw the Australian dollar recover (Graph 8). Foreign buyers were noted in particular as they rebuilt their Australian dollar investments, and by early February the exchange rate had risen to around US65 cents. The trade-weighted index has also risen, although a little less strongly than the rate against the US dollar. ", " The US economy has continued to record an exceptionally good combination of strong growth and low inflation. The current economic expansion is the longest since the 1960s, and its strength has for some time exceeded the expectations of most observers. Real GDP grew by 4.1 per cent over 1998, with the pace of growth increasing further in the fourth quarter (Graph 9). The strength of the US economy has been driven by robust domestic demand, which has more than offset the effects of weaker external conditions on export and import-competing industries. ", " Despite some job losses in the manufacturing sector, the labour market overall remained supportive of income growth: employment grew by 2¼ per cent over the year to December, and real wages by 1½ per cent. Spending has also been supported by the low level of interest rates and by sharp increases in financial wealth associated with rising asset prices. Reflecting these developments, conventional measures of household saving have declined to historically low levels. The low levels of saving, and the apparent role that share market growth has played in stimulating demand to date, may point to a source of risk in the outlook for consumer spending in the period ahead. At this stage, however, surveys suggest that consumers remain very optimistic. ", " Weaker external demand has had its most noticeable impact on the manufacturing sector, where growth in industrial production slowed to an annual rate of around 2 per cent in the December quarter. Nonetheless, growth in the economy overall is being supported by the recent reductions in interest rates, which also appear to have dispelled earlier concerns of an emerging credit squeeze. The combination of weak external and strong domestic demand has seen the US current account deficit widen. It was equivalent to around 3 per cent of GDP in the September quarter. ", " Despite the duration and strength of the current expansion, and the tightness of the labour market, US inflation remains subdued. The increase in the price of goods has slowed considerably over the past two years, in part due to increased competition in the tradeable sector, the higher exchange rate for much of the past year, and lower commodity prices. Prices in the more domestically oriented services sector are rising more quickly, but still by less than 3 per cent. Considering the strength of the US expansion over recent years, the inflation rate is remarkably low at around 1½ per cent. ", " The core economies of the euro area expanded moderately during 1998 but may have lost some momentum towards the end of the year. Weak external demand is constraining activity in Germany and France. This has been most apparent in the manufacturing sectors of these countries, where production growth has slowed considerably. In Germany, there are signs that part of this slowing also reflects a weakening of domestic demand: domestic manufacturing orders have fallen by 6 per cent since their peak in mid 1998. Domestic demand in France is faring better, although business confidence is faltering in both countries. Some other continental European countries are growing more strongly, possibly reflecting the expansionary effects of reducing their interest rates to French and German levels in preparation for the introduction of the single currency. ", " The UK economy is in quite a different cyclical position from continental Europe, with growth slowing substantially over the past year after a number of years of strong economic expansion. The decline in growth reflects a slowing in external demand and, until relatively recently, tight monetary conditions. Responding to the easing in demand and weaker inflationary pressures, the Bank of England has progressively reduced short-term interest rates since October by 200 basis points, to 5½ per cent. ", " With moderate growth and falls in oil and other commodity prices, inflation in the euro area remains low, at around 1 per cent. Inflation in the United Kingdom has been close to its target of 2½ per cent. ", " The Japanese economy is showing few signs of recovery from recession as yet. Output has declined by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> over the past year and a half, with private final demand particularly weak (Table 3). Consumer confidence has continued to deteriorate in recent months, fuelled by rising rates of unemployment, and tax cuts have so far been unsuccessful in generating a recovery in consumer spending. Businesses also remain very pessimistic. The <em>Tankan</em> survey for the December quarter reports that business sentiment, capacity utilisation, and businesses' assessments of their financial positions, were all at very low levels. These conditions have been reflected in declining capital spending. ", " Japan's export performance has also deteriorated over the past year. Trade with other Asian economies (which accounts for almost half of Japanese exports) has been adversely affected by the Asian crisis and by the net appreciation of the yen against most other Asian currencies. Japan's exports to Asia declined by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> in volume terms over the year to December. Exports to the US and Europe have fared better, in part due to the depreciation of the yen against those currencies for most of 1998. However, the recent rebound in the exchange rate, if sustained, will make it more difficult for Japan to export to those markets. Despite the overall weakening in exports, Japan's trade surplus has widened significantly, with the weakness in domestic demand resulting in substantial declines in imports. ", " Efforts to stimulate the economy through monetary and fiscal policies have continued. The Bank of Japan has allowed its overnight call rate to stay at just ¼ of a percentage point, and has continued to supply the system with liquidity. But low interest rates alone appear to have been less effective than normal in stimulating demand, given the degree of caution on the part of borrowers and lenders. In addition, deflation has contributed to a higher level of real interest rates despite the historical lows in nominal rates. The effect of the fiscal stimulus packages announced earlier in 1998 began to show up in the September quarter with a positive contribution to growth from public demand. Further public spending increases should follow, but it is not yet clear whether the overall fiscal stimulus will be enough to generate a more broadly based recovery in private incomes and spending. ", " A sustainable recovery will also depend importantly on a resolution of Japan's financial sector problems. Finding political consensus on the appropriate policy response has proved difficult, but some progress has been made over the past few months, and the process appears to be accelerating. The government has now nationalised two large banks, and has taken applications from most city banks for an injection of public funds. At this stage, however, only a small proportion of the funds set aside by the government for this purpose has been used. ", " With the exception of Indonesia, the initial crisis economies of east Asia showed some signs of stabilising during the second half of 1998, with industrial production in Korea picking up strongly according to the official data <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 10)</span>. Prospects for growth are being assisted by the reductions in interest rates that have taken place over the past half year, and, more recently, by the adoption of more expansionary fiscal policies. In Korea, export revenues continued to show little growth in US dollar terms. Over the past year, the available data suggest that this reflects some volume growth offset by reductions in US dollar prices of their exports. Depreciation of the <em>won</em> has allowed Korean export prices to increase strongly in domestic currency terms, which will assist the profitability of their export industries. To date, Thailand and Indonesia have had less success in boosting exports, with Indonesia, in particular, suffering badly from trade financing problems. ", " Domestic demand remains weak across the initial crisis economies, with rising unemployment and reduced asset values constraining consumption expenditure. More fundamentally, and notwithstanding some important progress, much remains to be done in the restructuring and strengthening of the financial and corporate sectors of all these economies. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, there is a clear contrast between the continued growth in China and Taiwan, albeit at a reduced pace, and the deep recessions being experienced in Hong Kong and Singapore. The Chinese economy recorded GDP growth of 7.8 per cent in 1998, the fastest in the region but down from an average of 9 per cent in the previous two years. The bankruptcy of Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation (GITIC) announced in January has highlighted concerns about other financial companies in China, although the financial sector was already known to be in difficulty. In Taiwan, the pace of growth over 1998 declined to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>, down from an average of 7 per cent over the previous two years, but appears to have strengthened in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, both Hong Kong and Singapore recorded declining output. ", " Recessions across most of east Asia and Japan reduced world output growth in 1998 to an estimated <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¼ per cent</span> from around 4 per cent in 1997, representing a marked departure from the forecasts made by the IMF and other forecasters at the end of 1997 or even as recently as May 1998 (Graph 11). The scale of revisions to forecasts seen over the past year reflects the unanticipated spread of the financial turmoil from the initial crisis economies to the rest of east Asia, to emerging markets more generally and, for a time, to the financial markets of the industrial countries. The IMF's latest published forecast for world growth in 1999 is 2¼ per cent. The composition of that growth is expected to be slightly different from that in 1998, potentially to the advantage of Australian exporters, as Asia is expected to contribute more to growth. These forecasts pre-date the recent strong indicators for the US economy, and may therefore understate the continuing momentum of growth in <span class=\"no-wrap\">the US</span>. ", " The forecasts also pre-date the events in Brazil in mid January, which must be viewed as an additional source of uncertainty for the world economy. Brazil itself accounts for only a small share of US exports (about 2 per cent), but Latin America as a whole is more significant, absorbing around 20 per cent of US exports. These export markets could obviously be affected by any tendency for the financial difficulties to spread across the region. A number of other Latin American countries are now in the difficult position of running high interest rates to protect their currencies at a time when their domestic economies are weakening, and in some cases contracting. There is also the risk that these events may contribute to financial market nervousness in the industrial countries. ", " The weaker international environment has not been supportive of world trade, which is estimated by the IMF to have increased by around 3½ per cent in 1998, compared with growth of nearly 10 per cent in the previous year. Growth of 4½ per cent is forecast for 1999. The nature of the Asian and Japanese financial crises has also had important implications for the distribution of global trade flows. The massive capital outflow from Asian economies has seen their combined current account swing from a small surplus in 1997 to an estimated surplus of nearly US$100 billion in 1998 (Table 4). The counterpart to this in the rest of the world has primarily been the widening of the US external deficit, reflecting the continued strong growth in the US economy while export opportunities weakened. ", " As noted earlier, inflation outcomes in 1998 were low in all the major industrial countries, with a year-ended outcome for the G-7 countries as a whole of roughly 1 per cent. Such a low aggregate outcome does not imply global deflation, although an increased number of individual goods are likely to experience absolute price declines. Deflation is a genuine problem for Japan, however, and for that reason alone, is of some concern for the global economy. ", " The Australian economy grew strongly throughout 1998 despite the unfavourable external conditions: the September quarter national accounts recorded year-ended growth in GDP of 5 per cent, and subsequent indicators point to further expansion in the December quarter (Table 5). Most sources of output growth exhibited strength over the past year, the only significant exception being exports, although the ability of some exporters to find new markets staved off what otherwise could have been large falls. Growth has been supported by a number of factors in the recent period, including the low level of interest rates and the ready availability of credit, as well as the assistance to exporters and import-competing industries from a lower exchange rate. In addition, conditions in the household sector have generally been conducive to strong growth in consumer demand. ", " Overall, the economy has been stronger than expected in the recent period, and appears to have entered 1999 with considerable momentum. The main area of weakness is likely to remain the export sector, where prospects are that the international environment will remain difficult for some time. There are also signs that the housing sector is unlikely to contribute as strongly to growth in the period ahead as it has recently, and there has been a decline in near-term business investment intentions. Nonetheless, general indicators of business and consumer confidence picked up strongly towards the end of 1998. ", " Growth of retail sales, after a slower period around the middle of the year, strengthened in the second half. In the December quarter, retail sales increased by 0.5 per cent in real terms, to be 2.7 per cent higher than <span class=\"no-wrap\">a year earlier (Graph 12)</span>. Over the second half of the year, sales increased by 1.9 per cent in real terms. Monthly sales figures point to solid growth through most of the second half of the year, although they show a decline in December. This latter result may have been affected by changes in the seasonal pattern that have been evident over the December/ January period in recent years, and it is noteworthy that weak December figures have tended to be followed by a bounce-back in January. Some smoothing of the two figures is likely when seasonal factors are re-analysed and presented in July. Overall growth in sales during the past year has been broadly based across most categories of retailers, although there has been some weakness recorded for household-goods retailers, possibly reflecting loss of market share to department stores. ", " Motor vehicle purchases have also been strong. In 1998 as a whole, the number of new car registrations was <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span> higher than in 1997, although monthly figures suggest a levelling out, albeit at very high levels, towards the end of the year. The strength in motor vehicle sales has reflected a very competitive pricing environment, as well as the low level of interest rates, both of which have contributed to affordability. The ageing of the car fleet in recent years has probably also contributed to a desire by consumers to upgrade the car stock. Although these factors are likely to persist in 1999, motor vehicle purchases seem unlikely to contribute to overall consumption growth to the same extent as they did in 1998. ", " Total consumption expenditure of households has been increasing more strongly than retail sales for some time, partly reflecting the strength of motor vehicle purchases. There has also been relatively strong growth of spending on services, such as recreation, travel and communications, that are not included in retail trade. This, in turn, is part of a longer-term increase in the share of spending accounted for by services. Over the year to the September quarter, total consumption increased by 3.9 per cent. Consumer spending growth has, for the past couple of years, outstripped the growth in household incomes, resulting in a gradual decline in the household saving rate. ", " The overall strength in consumption has been supported by a high level of consumer confidence. Despite a weakening in the early to middle part of 1998, consumer sentiment, as measured by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index, remained above its long-term average throughout the year (Graph 13). The deterioration in confidence early last year appears to have mainly reflected nervousness about economic prospects, which in turn is likely to have reflected news about the problems affecting Australia's trading partners and international financial markets. Despite these concerns, consumers remained relatively up-beat in their assessments of their own financial situations, and respondents to the survey over the past 18 months have consistently reported greater confidence in their personal financial situations than in general economic conditions. Both aspects of sentiment picked up strongly in the latter part of 1998 and early 1999, bringing overall consumer sentiment to its highest level in <span class=\"no-wrap\">four years</span>. ", " Increases in household wealth have also contributed to the favourable environment for consumption growth. The household sector's financial wealth has increased strongly over the past year, partly as a result of the strength of the share market (see section on ‘<a href=\"#financial-conditions\">Financial Conditions</a>’ below). Two additional factors, the AMP demutualisation and the Telstra privatisation, have also resulted in a significant boost to available household wealth in the recent period. While the AMP demutualisation transformed rather than created wealth, it did enable households to liquidate wealth that was previously inaccessible. In addition, the privatisation of Telstra and subsequent strong rise in its share price created capital gains for many households who were not previously shareholders. Both of these developments have contributed to a trend, which was already in place, towards an increase in the proportion of households owning shares. One consequence of this trend may be that consumer spending is being more strongly boosted by a rise in share prices than would have been the case in the past, when shares were more narrowly held. The AMP demutualisation, which was probably the more important of the recent special factors, is likely to have had its main impact on consumer spending in the second half of 1998, and this impact can be expected to wane in the year ahead. ", " Forward indicators of housing activity appeared to reach a peak around the middle of 1998, with the number of building approvals declining in the second half of the year. In the December quarter, the number of building approvals was 8 per cent lower than six months earlier. Loan approvals for housing have been more robust, picking up in the latter part of the year after a weaker period around the September quarter, but they have nonetheless shown little growth over the past year as a whole. The overall level of dwelling investment, which includes alterations and additions as well as work on new dwellings, is currently around 27 per cent higher than at the time of the most recent trough. ", " The recent building approvals data may overstate any weakening in housing activity in the second half of 1998. Changes to building approval procedures in NSW and Queensland around the middle of 1998 have meant that building approvals can now be issued by private agencies, rather than the local councils surveyed by the ABS. The change may have led to some under-reporting of the number of approvals in those States. This appears to be supported by the fact that sharp falls in the recorded number of building approvals are not apparent for the other States, and also appear out of line with the loan approvals data (Graph 14). ", " The most appropriate interpretation of the recent indicators is probably that building approvals have declined a little, but that the overall level of housing activity is likely to remain close to current levels during 1999. Work in the pipeline should sustain construction levels for some time into the current year, and the housing upswing, unlike most in the past, does not seem to have generated a level of overall construction significantly out of line with underlying demand. Moreover, high levels of affordability should continue to support demand. Also noteworthy is that alterations and additions, which tend to be less cyclical than new construction, now account for as much as 45 per cent of all housing activity. ", " Recent developments in house prices are not suggestive of significant imbalances between supply and demand. On average, house prices are now rising only moderately, following a period of rapid growth in 1997 and early 1998 driven in large part by sharp increases in the inner-city suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. Rents in most of the major capitals are also rising at a moderate rate, which is consistent with supply and demand being fairly close to balance. The main exceptions to this are Canberra and Tasmania, where declining populations have resulted in decreased demand for housing and downward pressure on prices. ", " Measures of business sentiment recovered in the latter part of 1998, following declines in the first half of the year prompted by fears of sharply reduced external demand and slower domestic growth. The NAB survey for the December quarter shows that overall indicators of business confidence and expected business conditions picked up to around their level of a year ago, although the mining sector became more pessimistic. Expectations concerning export sales improved, but remain below their long-run average. The Dun and Bradstreet survey confirms a general improvement in confidence across most industries. More specialised surveys of the manufacturing sector, the ACCI-Westpac and Colonial State Bank surveys, also suggest that conditions improved noticeably, following a sharp deterioration earlier in the year. The improvement relates more to domestic than to export sales (Graph 15), although the latter has improved significantly of late. ", " The most recent surveys of sentiment postdate information on corporate profitability which, as measured by gross operating surplus, was flat in the September quarter. Nonetheless, profits rose by around 12 per cent over the year to September and, as a share of GDP, were higher than their average for the past decade. The <span class=\"no-wrap\">above-average</span> level of profitability seems consistent with the tendency for many firms to have reported their own conditions as being better than their assessment of the general outlook. Consistent with earlier surveys of sentiment, the flatness in September quarter profits primarily reflected difficulties in the manufacturing sector. Small business profits are a bit below their decade-average share of GDP. ", " Business investment in equipment increased strongly in the September quarter. Part of this may reflect some slippage of expenditure from the surprisingly weak June quarter and, given the sharp fall in volumes of imports of machinery and industrial equipment apparent in December quarter data, may well have been reversed subsequently. This would not be inconsistent with results from the ABS capital expenditure survey released in November, which pointed to a weakening in the near-term outlook for business equipment investment. Based on average realisation ratios, the survey suggests little change in nominal investment in 1998–99 as a whole, which would imply a slight fall in real terms after allowing for rises in imported equipment costs. For this to occur for the year as a whole would require significant declines in real terms after the September quarter. ", " These survey expectations are always subject to uncertainty, and it is possible that they will be revised upwards given the recent rebound in business confidence. Nonetheless, the composition of investment expectations seems broadly consistent with trends in business sentiment. The roughly unchanged level of expected investment in nominal terms, according to the survey, comprises a large decline in mining investment – to around 25 per cent lower than last year – roughly offset by small increases in expenditure in other sectors (Graph 16). This, in turn, would be consistent with the pattern of recent surveys of profit expectations, which are reasonably solid for retailing and manufacturing but quite gloomy for the mining sector. ", " It is possible that mining investment would have been weak in 1998–99 even without the crisis in Asia, simply because its tremendously rapid growth in recent years made it quite likely that it would experience a pause at some stage. However, the capital expenditure survey indicates that investment intentions in the mining sector have been revised down substantially in the past six months. This development, and the deferral of some very large projects, seems mainly attributable to weakening external demand and falling commodity prices. ", " Investment in buildings and structures was quite strong last year, rising by 15 per cent over the year to September (Graph 17). However, several large projects (particularly in the mining sector) are nearing completion. The amount of new work entering the pipeline should be sufficient to roughly maintain the current level of activity for a few more quarters, but the flattening out of approvals in recent months suggests that, at this stage, there is limited impetus for further growth in the medium term. Also, while much of the mining investment has been centred on Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, Queensland, a disproportionately large share of building investment is centred on New South Wales. This largely reflects Olympics-related investment and many of the Olympic venues will be completed over the latter part of this year, while a number of hotels are scheduled for completion in early 2000. ", " The office property market is experiencing some increases in available space, as several developments are completed. This has led to rising vacancies in some office centres and, in general, a steady supply of new developments and refurbishments has meant that rents have been stable and price increases modest. Despite the rapid increase in work done over the past year, the value of outstanding office projects is presently about three times the level of two years ago, suggesting continued growth in supply of office space for some time. One difficulty for these markets is that prospective tenants may be reluctant to commit to new premises at a time when growth in demand for their output may be expected to slow. ", " Businesses appear content with current holdings of inventories according to surveys, and stocks-to-sales ratios appear to be broadly in line with historical trends at present. In the early part of 1998, stock accumulation accounted for a significant part of the strong growth in output; stock building in the private non-farm sector contributed about a percentage point to expenditure and output growth, and about half of that was accounted for by the manufacturing sector following a run-down in stocks the year before. This source of growth in demand did not continue in the subsequent quarters and, at present, there seems little pressure in aggregate for firms to either run down their stock levels or to build them up more rapidly than normal. ", " Recent employment data have been quite volatile but it is clear that the recovery in the labour market, which began in late 1997, continued throughout 1998. Employment rose by slightly more than 2 per cent over <span class=\"no-wrap\">the year (Graph 18)</span>. Much of the more recent strength in employment has been in the part-time component, although the past 18 months have seen strong growth in full-time employment as well. The rate of employment growth sustained during 1998 allowed the unemployment rate to fall below <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> towards the end of the year. In the December quarter, the unemployment rate averaged <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.7 per cent</span>, its lowest level since 1990 and well below its average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.3 per cent</span> a year earlier. ", " Recent employment growth has been consistent with general economic developments with respect to both sectoral performance and timing. Job growth has been highest in construction, property and business services, and finance, all of which are areas where growth in demand and output has been relatively strong. Employment has generally been weaker in those industries that are more dependent on external demand, particularly manufacturing, and to a lesser extent mining and agriculture. ", " Developments in recent quarters suggest that employment continues to respond broadly to movements in output growth with a lag (Graph 19). One implication of this lagged response is that non-farm labour productivity growth tends to pick up initially when output growth increases, as businesses expand output by using existing resources more intensively before increasing their levels of employment. This may have been amplified in the recent period by a more cautious approach to hiring due to the more uncertain business climate. The overall effect has lifted labour productivity growth well above historical averages recently; over the year to the September quarter, <span class=\"no-wrap\">non-farm</span> labour productivity rose by 3 per cent. ", " Forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of job vacancies, suggest that labour demand remains robust. The ANZ measure of job advertisements increased further through the December quarter and, despite a decline in January (when figures are often volatile), has increased by 12 per cent over the past year. The ABS vacancies series, which was unusually volatile during 1998, rose sharply in the December quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">14 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier (Graph 20). Hiring intentions also appear to remain firm, with all the major surveys recording little change in the net balance of companies expecting to increase employment. ", " Australia's exports have continued to be adversely affected by the unfavourable conditions overseas. The value of exports (excluding gold) declined by 3 per cent in the December quarter, and by around 2 per cent over the past year. The decline in value terms recorded in the December quarter appears to have been accounted for by a sharp fall in export prices, implying that volumes were fairly flat in the quarter and showed little net growth over the year. This flat performance contrasts sharply with earlier years. Over the period 1990–97, exports grew at an average annual rate of 9 per cent in volume terms, and at a similar rate in value terms. ", " The effects of weaker external conditions have been most evident for manufactured and services exports. For a number of years, these were the fastest-growing components of Australian exports, but they began to weaken around the second half of 1997 as the crisis-affected economies in east Asia turned down. Services exports were affected by a sharp downturn in tourist arrivals from east Asian countries, which was only partly offset by stronger arrivals from other sources. Both services and manufactured exports declined further in the second half of 1998. Exports of resources have generally been more resilient than the other components, and continued to grow well into 1998. This pattern broadly reflected the greater success by resource exporters in finding alternative markets for their products in the face of weaker demand from east Asia. In the second half of 1998, however, resource exports declined in value terms, probably reflecting the effect of lower commodity prices. Rural exports were the only component to increase in value in the second half of 1998, reflecting increased production resulting from more favourable weather conditions. ", " Since the onset of the east Asian crisis in mid 1997, the value of merchandise exports to the initial crisis-affected countries has fallen by 15 per cent (Graph 21). Exports to other countries in the region (excluding Japan) fell by about 11 per cent in the first half of 1998, but appear to have stabilised since then. There has also been a decline in exports to Japan recently, after unusually strong growth in 1997. To a significant degree, the impact of the loss of export sales to these markets since mid 1997 has been offset by stronger growth in sales to the United States, to Europe, and to other markets. As noted above, much of this reflected successful re-direction of resource exports. Over the second half of 1998, however, exports to the US and Europe fell by around 6 per cent, with a decline in rural exports, particularly wheat, and manufactures. ", " Growth in the volume of imports has weakened noticeably during the past year, and particularly in the second half of the year. In the September quarter 1998, import volumes fell slightly, and preliminary indications point to a further slight fall in the December quarter. With strong price increases, the <em>value</em> of imports increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> over the year. The restraint in import volumes over the past year or so appears mainly attributable to the depreciation of the Australian dollar against currencies of our import sources and the resultant rise in import prices at the docks. ", " Largely reflecting the profile for motor vehicle imports, consumption import volumes declined in the second half of the year after growing strongly in the first half. Capital imports in underlying terms (excluding civil aircraft) rose strongly in the September quarter, but retraced this gain in the December quarter, with imports of machinery and industrial equipment falling sharply. Imports of intermediate goods appear to have picked up strongly in the December quarter after a slight fall in September. Service imports fell through much of 1998, although this may have been arrested in the December quarter. The fall reflected, in part, declining purchases of business and technical services related to, for example, computing and telecommunications. These services are purchased primarily from industrial countries whose currencies have appreciated significantly against the Australian dollar, which may have prompted some substitution towards domestic suppliers. The decline in service imports also reflects a shift in the pattern of Australian tourism abroad in favour of cheaper destinations, probably to take advantage of divergent exchange-rate movements. ", " With imports having grown strongly in value terms over the past year and exports showing only a small increase, the current account deficit has widened significantly. In the September quarter 1998, the current account deficit was equivalent to 5 per cent of GDP, after averaging 4.7 per cent of GDP in the first half of the year and <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.7 per cent</span> in the second half of 1997 (Graph 22). The widening in the current account position reflects an increase in the trade deficit, with the net income deficit having remained roughly stable over the past year. Monthly trade data point to a further increase in the trade deficit in the December quarter, and a corresponding widening in the current account deficit to around 5½ per cent of GDP. ", " Australia's net foreign liabilities increased slightly in the September quarter to around 60 per cent of GDP, reflecting a rise in net foreign borrowing and, to a lesser extent, falls in the market value of Australia's foreign equity assets. Depreciation of the exchange rate has had very little effect on the valuation of net foreign liabilities, as Australia's gross foreign-currency liabilities are roughly equal to holdings of foreign-currency assets. This has also meant that exchange-rate depreciation has had no noticeable effect on the net income deficit. The ratio of net income payments to exports, a standard measure of the debt-servicing burden, has continued to fall, albeit modestly, reflecting declines in world interest rates; currently this ratio is around its historical average. ", " Prices of most commodities have continued to weaken in recent months. Most notably, the recently negotiated contracts for coking coal resulted in price falls of around 18 per cent in US dollar terms (Graph 23). The market has been affected by adverse conditions in the world steel industry, where a global oversupply has forced major steel producers such as Japan to reduce production. ", " The effect of weaker external demand is also apparent in base metal prices, which fell by 8 per cent in SDR terms over the December quarter and by around 20 per cent over the past year. Prices for rural commodities also fell by about 20 per cent over 1998 but tended to be more stable over the last few months of the year, with some recovery in wheat prices offsetting weaker beef prices. Overall, commodity prices have declined by 15 per cent over the past year, including by around 5 per cent in the December quarter, in SDR terms (Graph 24). The depreciation of the Australian dollar has offset this decline to some extent: the commodity price index declined by 6 per cent over the year when measured in Australian dollars. The terms of trade fell by around 2–3 per cent in the December quarter and by around 8 per cent over the year. ", " The reduction on 2 December 1998 of the Bank's target cash rate saw financial intermediaries subsequently announce lower indicator rates on most variable-rate loans (Graph 25). While the cash rate has returned to the previous cyclical low of 1993/94, intermediaries' lending rates some time ago moved well below their levels at that time (Table 6). ", " The extent of the cuts following the monetary policy easing varied among intermediaries and from product to product; the average lag with which changes in variable-rate lending rates were passed on to existing borrowers was noticeably less than the average lag in the five easings of 1996/97. For business borrowers, the lags were also shorter than in the tightening phase of 1994. Movements are summarised in Table 7. ", " For housing loans, some banks passed on all of the most recent easing in the cash rate, while others passed on the bulk of it; a number of banks in this latter group, in effect, moved their interest rates into line with those of their major competitors. On average, banks cut interest rates on standard variable and basic housing loans by around 20 basis points, to 6.50 and 5.90 per cent respectively. ", " Mortgage managers generally passed on the full amount of the reduction in the cash rate, slightly widening their price advantage relative to banks. Standard variable loans from mortgage managers are available at 6.10 per cent, while basic loans are around 5.75 per cent. In part, the more complete pass-through of the cut in the cash rate by mortgage managers reflects the fact that mortgage managers' funding is sourced exclusively from short-term wholesale markets, in which interest rates tend to move with the cash rate. By contrast, banks also raise a significant proportion of their funding from retail deposits on which rates are already negligible, with almost no scope to reduce them further, i.e. banks' average cost of funds fell by less than the reduction in the cash rate and by less than mortgage managers'. The larger reduction of mortgage managers' lending rates may also reflect a decision, based on competitive pressures, to try to arrest the decline in their share of new housing loans. In 1998, this share returned towards its lower level of 1996, as banks recovered ground by introducing more competitively priced products. ", " On personal loans, most lenders reduced interest rates on residentially secured revolving lines of credit – commonly referred to as ‘home equity’ loans – where the average interest rate fell from 6.90 per cent to 6.60 per cent. Interest rates on other personal loans, including for credit cards, were not generally reduced. ", " Interest rates on the range of small business loans were typically reduced by around 25 basis points after the cut in the cash rate; some banks reduced rates on some products by less than this while others cut some rates by more. On the major small business products: indicator rates on residentially secured term loans and overdrafts were reduced by 25 basis points, to averages of 6.65 and 6.95 per cent respectively; the indicator rate on term loans secured by other assets was reduced by 30 basis points, to an average of 7.15 per cent; the indicator rate on overdrafts secured by other assets was reduced by 15 basis points to an average of 7.55 per cent. ", " The reduction in indicator rates announced by some banks early in 1998, independent of any move in monetary policy, has been translated into lower total interest costs for small businesses, resulting in a narrowing of banks' interest margins in this line of business. This is evident in the continued fall in the average interest rate paid on small business loans, which includes customer risk margins as well as advertised indicator rates. This weighted average rate was 8.8 per cent in September 1998 (the latest available data), 60 basis points lower than in the March quarter. The fall in the average interest rate paid on small business variable-rate loans between mid 1996, when the latest cycle of easing of monetary policy began, and September 1998 amounts to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.8 percentage</span> points, 1.3 percentage points more than the reduction in the cash rate over the same period. ", " Banks were more selective in reducing indicator rates on loans to large businesses. Two major banks which had held these rates steady since the previous easing of monetary policy reduced them by 25 basis points. Other major banks generally left unchanged rates on products which had been reduced in mid 1998 independent of any change in the cash rate. Indicator rates on variable-rate term loans to large businesses now average <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.90 per cent</span>, while overdraft rates average 7.95 per cent. Since mid 1996, indicator rates for large business have fallen by about the same amount as the cash rate. ", " While competition for small business loans has been evident in reduced indicator rates and explicit pricing of security offered, competition for lending to large business seems to have been occurring at the level of customer risk margins, with some discounting of interest rates on variable-rate loans apparent. The weighted-average interest rate on variable-rate loans to large business (excluding bills) was 7.6 per cent in the September quarter, about 0.5 of a percentage point below the average indicator rate. About 60 per cent of loans to large businesses are bill facilities, with less than 20 per cent priced from indicator rates on variable-rate loans. ", " Interest rates on fixed-rate lending typically reflect movements in yields of comparable maturity in capital markets. After the brief reversal in June, as the exchange rate weakened, the downward trend in fixed-rate loans was renewed over the second half of 1998 (Graph 26). Interest rates on three-year, fixed-rate housing loans are currently 6.4 per cent, half a percentage point lower than in June, and well below the previous cyclical low of 8.75 per cent in early 1994. Fixed-rates for small business loans are also at low levels, with indicator rates on <span class=\"no-wrap\">three-year</span> loans currently around 6.7 per cent. The continued low structure of long-term interest rates, and confidence that inflation is likely to remain low, saw another bank introduce a fixed-rate housing loan for a term of ten years; two major banks now offer fixed-rate loans with terms as long as this. Interest rates on these products are around 7 per cent. ", " Credit outstanding grew by more than 10 per cent over the year to December, well in excess of the economy's nominal rate of growth (Table 8). Within the total, credit to households continues to grow strongly, with personal credit increasing by more than 15 per cent over the past year; growth in credit for housing may have eased slightly in recent months, but remains close to 12 per cent. Business credit growth has been slightly more volatile over the past year, but appears to have been picking up over the past few months. Recent data suggest that business loan approvals have held up, providing further evidence that demand for business credit is firm. ", " Currency in circulation increased by around 8 per cent over 1998, consistent with the combination of relatively robust consumer demand and low interest rates. Growth in the deposit-based monetary aggregates, M1, M3 and broad money, was around 5–7 per cent over the year with a significant proportion of this growth accounted for by large increases in issues of certificates of deposit. With deposit growth relatively low, banks and NBFIs funded the steady growth in the supply of credit by using alternative sources of funds and, on occasion, reducing their holdings of non-loan assets. Such behaviour was particularly evident in the first half of 1998 when banks increased their offshore borrowing and reduced their holdings of government securities. ", " Growth in the value of funds under management declined in the September quarter, primarily reflecting the fall in values of domestic and major overseas equity markets. Nonetheless, growth has remained very strong (Table 9), and is likely to have picked up again in the December quarter given the strong performance of most major equity markets during that period. The bulk of funds (around three-quarters) continues to be held in domestic and overseas equities and long-term debt securities but, given that cash management trusts continue to be the fastest growing recipient of funds, the share of cash and deposits (now a bit less than 8 per cent) has been rising. ", " Growth in personal credit continues to be driven by strong growth in revolving credit facilities, including overdrafts and credit cards. Part of the increased use of these facilities reflects substitution away from personal instalment loans, and thus does not explain the pick-up in growth of total personal credit. It may also be the case that credit cards are being used increasingly by households to make payments previously made by other means. One sign that this may be the case is the fact that the number of non-cash credit card transactions rose by about 40 per cent over the past year. It could also be the case that growth in personal credit has been overstated to some extent (and housing credit a bit understated) by the reporting by some banks of home-equity products, which are used in part for housing, entirely as personal overdrafts and other personal loans. On the other hand, as has been noted above, a genuinely strong increase in personal credit is consistent with the strength of consumption expenditure. ", " The past few years have witnessed a rapid expansion and change of composition in household balance sheets. Household liabilities increased by 13 per cent over the year to the September quarter, driven by strong growth in both personal and housing debt, associated with strong consumer spending and confidence, low interest rates and relatively easy access to funds. Households' financial assets, which are around three times the value of liabilities, increased at a slower rate than liabilities over the past year, although by a larger absolute amount. This meant that households' net financial wealth continued to increase over the year. ", " The rebound in equity prices in the December quarter should have seen it improve further. ", " These developments suggest that, in aggregate, household balance sheets are in good shape, with higher levels of wealth than in the past and more diverse portfolios. An area of possible longer-term concern, however, is that higher levels of household debt, and an increased holding of equity investments, may mean that households are more exposed to financial market volatility than before (Graph 27). In addition, the aggregate figures are likely to mask some significant variations in asset and liability holdings across households. For example, many households with relatively recent home loans would be more highly indebted than the average, and the debt exposure of this group is increasing as the size of the average new loan continues to rise. ", " Growth in business investment has been supported by the low cost and ready availability of finance for businesses. There has been a gradual shift in the mix of finance towards a greater use of debt. The (private) corporate sector raised around $3 billion in equity and almost $10 billion in debt (either from financial institutions or directly from capital markets) in the September quarter, implying a further increase in the ratio of corporate debt to equity from the levels of several years ago. However, the low interest rate environment means that servicing burdens remain well below their average of the past decade. Also, the corporate sector's consolidated holdings of financial assets rose strongly in the second half of last year. ", " The modest widening of the spread between government and corporate bond yields in late 1998 prompted concerns in some circles that businesses were finding it more difficult to obtain finance. There is, however, little evidence to support such a view. Direct debt raisings did slow for a brief period in late 1998, but these represent a very small proportion, around 5 per cent, of total funding for Australian businesses. Funding from other sources remained readily available. The largest single source of finance, retained earnings, accounts for around half of the corporate sector's total funding, and is not directly affected by these problems. Credit from financial intermediaries, which typically accounts for around 25 per cent of total corporate funding, continued to grow at a solid pace. New equity raisings, normally around 20 per cent of total funding, also appear to have been little affected by the developments in debt markets. Available survey data suggest businesses themselves did not experience problems; according to the latest ACCI-Westpac survey, for the December quarter, manufacturing firms have experienced no increased difficulty in obtaining finance over recent times. ", " Inflation remained low during 1998 at levels of just over 1½ per cent. The Consumer Price Index increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span> in the December quarter and by 1.6 per cent over the year to the December quarter (Graph 28). Measures of underlying inflation point to price increases of around 0.3 per cent in the quarter (Table 10). The Treasury underlying CPI increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the December quarter and by 1.6 per cent over the year, the same annual rate of increase as recorded the previous quarter. ", " The December quarter CPI is the second to be compiled on an ‘acquisitions’ basis, which excludes mortgage interest and consumer credit charges. The movement in the CPI over the year to December 1998 therefore contains two quarters (March and June) still constructed on the old basis; however, since there were no significant interest rate movements in that period, there is no longer any effective difference between the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year-ended</span> movement in the CPI and that of a consistent acquisitions CPI. Differences between the headline and underlying measures of inflation now reflect the exclusion of volatile items or other special factors from the underlying measures. In the December quarter, the main factors increasing the CPI relative to underlying measures were sharp increases in the prices of fresh fruit and vegetables and domestic holiday travel. These were partly offset by declining petrol prices. ", " Service prices have continued to rise noticeably more quickly than goods prices. Over the latest year, private-sector service prices increased by 2.7 per cent, compared with goods price increases of 1 per cent. This difference seems attributable mainly to the greater exposure of the goods-producing sector to international competition, whereas service prices are likely to reflect more closely the trends in domestic labour costs. Prices of imported goods in the CPI have been declining almost continuously over the past three years (see below), and the pressure of competition has probably constrained the ability of many domestic <span class=\"no-wrap\">goods-producers</span> to raise prices. As discussed below, there is a puzzling contrast between these continued declines in import prices at the consumer level and the higher prices recorded at the docks. Nonetheless, it is clear that, at the consumer level, import prices are having a restraining influence on overall goods prices. ", " Motor vehicle prices provide a good example of this process. The retail price of imported motor vehicles fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.9 per cent</span> over the year to the December quarter, and competition from imports has seen the retail price of domestically produced vehicles fall by 2.7 per cent over the same period. Overall, motor vehicle price declines have reduced the increase in the CPI over the past year by 0.2 percentage points, and the Treasury underlying inflation rate by 0.3 percentage points. ", " The depreciation of the Australian dollar in the period since early 1997 has been followed by an increase in the landed price of imports but, as noted above, not yet by any increase in import prices at the retail level. Since the first half of 1997, the Australian dollar has depreciated by 10 per cent in import-weighted terms and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">17 per cent</span> against the major currencies. On both measures, it has been relatively stable for the past few months. Reflecting the exchange-rate depreciation, landed import prices increased by 13 per cent between the March quarter 1997 and September quarter 1998, the period corresponding with the bulk of the exchange-rate movement, before declining by 1 per cent in the December quarter. Taken at face value, these developments suggest that the first stage of pass-through, from the exchange rate to landed import prices, may be largely complete. ", " Average historical experience would suggest that second-stage pass-through of these price increases to the retail level should now be occurring (Graph 29). As noted above, however, imported retail prices are still falling, and have been doing so for much of the past three years (Graph 30). In the December quarter, the imported goods component of the CPI declined by 0.7 per cent, to be 1.3 per cent lower than a year earlier. Although the fall in motor vehicle prices discussed above accounts for most of this fall, the prices of other imported goods also declined in the quarter, to be 0.4 per cent lower over the year. In the case of cars, the decline in retail prices of imported cars occurred despite an increase of 5 per cent in the landed price over the past year. ", " A possible explanation for the contrast between landed and retail import prices is that the rise in landed import prices may be overstated. It may be the case that suppliers from countries with sharply lower exchange rates have reduced their effective export prices, in US dollar terms, to an extent not fully reflected in official data. This might occur, for example, if recorded prices for intra-firm trade were not frequently revised in US dollar terms even when the effective price to the purchaser (including such things as sales incentives and rebates) was changing. If this has been occurring, the import price index would tend to overstate price increases for goods imported from countries whose exchange rates were depreciating against the US dollar. If correct, that would mean that the first-stage pass-through has been smaller than the official import-price data suggest, and that the eventual effect on retail prices will also be correspondingly smaller. ", " Another possibility is that the contrast between the landed and retail import price movements may simply reflect a longer-than-usual delay in the pass-through to the retail level. Increased use of exchange-rate hedging in recent years may have given importers greater insulation from exchange-rate movements than in the past; to the extent that this is occurring, cost increases would still be experienced when the hedges expire. It is also possible that competitive conditions are inducing wholesalers and retailers to absorb import price increases to a greater extent than seen in the past. Although this would be difficult to reconcile with the current strong demand conditions, there is some evidence of pressure on wholesalers' and retailers' margins in the NAB business survey, with recent results showing historically high numbers of wholesalers and retailers reporting that ‘too low an exchange rate’ is expected to be the major constraint on their profitability. It remains to be seen whether any such compression of margins is sustained, or whether import price increases are eventually passed on in line with average historical experience. ", " For manufacturing firms, the impact of the exchange-rate depreciation on costs has largely been offset by the weakness in commodity prices, especially oil prices, which have declined in Australian dollar terms by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> over the past year. The price of imported inputs rose by only 1.5 per cent over 1998, allowing total material costs to fall (Table 11). As a consequence, inflation in the prices of domestically produced manufactured goods has remained very low at the wholesale level. Surveys of manufacturing firms suggest a continuance of this trend into the March quarter. For example, the ACCI-Westpac survey found a net balance of respondents expecting to lower their prices in the March quarter. Prices of materials used in construction have also shown little evidence of inflationary pressure, increasing by only 1–1½ per cent over 1998. ", " Despite reasonably strong demand for labour, much of the available data suggest that overall wage inflation remained moderate in the second half of 1998. The Wage Cost Index (WCI), a measure of wage inflation across a fixed basket of ‘constant quality’ jobs, increased by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter (including bonuses), to be 3.4 per cent higher over the year to the September quarter. The small increase in the June quarter, followed by a sizeable increase in the September quarter, probably reflects a concentration of pay increases at end June and end December. Other wage surveys have recently displayed similar quarterly volatility. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) increased by 1.8 per cent over the three months to August and by 4.2 per cent in year-ended terms (Table 12). ", " New enterprise agreements have continued to yield wage rises noticeably lower than two to three years ago. In the September quarter, the average annual rate of increase for wages in new federal agreements was below <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> for the third quarter in succession. Wage increases in the private sector were slightly higher, at just above 4 per cent in the latest quarter (Graph 31). Reflecting the more subdued outcomes of recent enterprise agreements, annual wage rises in currently active agreements declined to 4 per cent in the September quarter, well down from the peak of 5 per cent in mid 1997. ", " Nonetheless, some pockets of wage pressure have been apparent, notably in the construction sector, where output has risen rapidly over the past year. Recent enterprise agreements in the construction sector have been yielding wage increases well above the economy-wide average. In the September quarter, construction sector agreements yielded average annualised increases of 7.3 per cent, similar to the levels seen in that sector around a year ago. The WCI for the construction sector has also been increasing faster than the economy-wide average, to show an increase of 4.1 per cent over the year to the September quarter. ", " Consumers' inflation expectations, as surveyed by the Melbourne Institute, have been noticeably higher in 1998 than in 1997 (Graph 32). This may reflect consumers anticipating price increases for many retail goods flowing from the recent currency depreciation. The median response obtained from this survey has also been unusually volatile over the past eight months, and may be suggestive of greater uncertainty on the part of consumers. In January, the median expectation was 4.6 per cent, up sharply from 3.4 per cent in December, after oscillating across this range for several months. ", " Inflation expectations of those involved directly in wage and price setting have remained low, and in some cases declined further. The Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training's (ACIRRT) survey of trade union officials, conducted after the release of the December quarter CPI, obtained median forecasts for inflation of 1.8 per cent over the year to June 1999 and 2.3 per cent over the year to June 2000 (Table 13). Business surveys imply a continuation of low inflation. ", " Financial market economists, as surveyed by the Bank, have revised down their expectations of inflation following the December quarter CPI result. The median expectation of underlying inflation for the year to June 1999 is <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.7 per cent</span>, rising to 2.1 per cent for the year to June 2000. Expectations for the headline CPI are slightly lower in the current year, partly reflecting the impact of the health insurance rebate in the March quarter. Financial market participants also remain confident of low inflation in the longer term. The inflation expectation implied by the price of 10-year indexed bonds has declined further in recent months, to a current level of 1.8 per cent. ", " The inflation outlook has for some time been characterised by weak domestic inflationary pressures, combined with an expectation that exchange-rate depreciation would soon exert upward pressure on import prices. Recent developments suggest that domestic demand and output are now stronger than had earlier been expected, while the inflationary impact of currency depreciation has yet to be seen in consumer prices. ", " The data on import prices, as discussed above, show a sharp contrast between prices at the docks and those at the consumer level. Consumer import prices so far appear to have been unresponsive to rising prices at the docks, and have continued to decline more than a year after the Australian dollar began its sharp depreciation. While this may just mean a longer-than-normal delay in the commencement of pass-through to consumer prices, it may also be an indication that the eventual pass-through is likely to be smaller than average and to occur more slowly. On balance, the possibility of a positive, but significantly lower-than-normal, contribution of exchange-rate depreciation to inflation, which was canvassed in the November <em>Semi-Annual Statement</em>, is now more likely. ", " Domestically, inflationary pressures remain subdued although, with the economy having grown at a significantly above-trend pace over the past year, domestic cost and price pressures will, in time, be stronger than would otherwise have been the case. Inflation expectations are generally low, with the exception of those recorded in the consumer survey, which appear to envisage a significant price impact from the currency depreciation. Wage costs on average are continuing to grow at a pace that is consistent with the containment of inflation. Although there have been some large wage increases agreed in the construction sector recently, these do not appear to be spreading more widely. The CPI will also be affected by the introduction of the health insurance rebate, which will reduce the March quarter 1999 CPI. It would also be affected by the introduction of the proposed GST and accompanying changes to other taxes, which would lead to a net increase in the CPI in the following year. ", " Allowing for a delayed and smaller-than-usual contribution to inflation from currency depreciation, and a continuation of the fairly moderate domestic price and cost pressures, inflation is likely to rise only gradually from its current level. The Bank's assessment is that inflation excluding one-off factors will increase gradually, reaching <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> by the end of 1999 and moving slightly higher over the following year. CPI inflation is likely to remain below 2 per cent during 1999, given the impact of the health insurance rebate, after which it is likely to rise to the same rate as underlying inflation. Both CPI and underlying inflation as measured would be expected temporarily to increase further during the latter part of 2000, as a result of the proposed introduction of the GST. Monetary policy will look through these one-off effects on the price level and focus on the ongoing component of inflation. ", " The main sources of uncertainty for the inflation outlook concern the impact of international competition, and the speed and extent of the prospective pass-through of the exchange-rate depreciation. These factors to date have contributed to lower-than-expected inflation outcomes, and the forecasts assume that the impact of <span class=\"no-wrap\">exchange-rate</span> depreciation remains smaller in the period immediately ahead than in average historical experience. Should the historical relationships re-assert themselves more strongly, a more noticeable pick-up in inflation could be envisaged. Alternatively, if international competitive pressures intensified even further, the dampening effect on inflation may be greater than currently anticipated.

{"Date": ["Reserve Bank Bulletin – November 1998"], "Section": [" ", " Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy "], "Text": [" Download the complete <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1998/nov/pdf/bu-1198-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Statement</em></a> <span class=\"filesize\" aria-label=\"PDF file size 386 Kilobytes\">386<abbr title=\"Kilobytes\">KB</abbr></span> ", "<p id=\"introduction\"> The events of the past six months have been dominated by news of financial instability, while changes in the underlying world economy have unfolded at a much more gradual pace. The financial market turmoil that began in Thailand in mid 1997 has now circled the globe and encompassed markets in major industrial countries, most notably the United States. At the time of the Bank's previous <em>Semi-Annual Statement</em>, the turmoil had spread from Thailand to the whole south-east Asian region. Since then, it has moved through three further phases: in June, it affected Japan, causing a sharp weakening of the yen and a fall in the share market; by August, the effect had spread to Russia, which eventually devalued its currency and announced a moratorium on repayment of government debt; and by September, it had an impact on the US and European banking systems. ", " The defining characteristic of markets recently has been an abrupt change of attitude towards risk taking. After a number of years in which a high appetite for risk on the part of international banks and borrowers had led to a large increase in leveraged cross-border flows of capital, circumstances changed sharply in mid 1998. An important part of the mechanism by which this change fed back to markets in industrial countries was the activities of hedge funds, which had borrowed heavily from banks in industrial countries to invest in emerging market assets. The collapse of emerging market asset prices following the actions of the Russian authorities left hedge funds nursing large losses, which in turn exposed banks that had provided funding to them through both equity and debt. In addition, banks, and especially investment banks, had large positions on their own account in emerging markets on which losses were incurred. ", " Asian financial markets, which had been subject to exceptional volatility over the preceding year, came through the latest episode unscathed, reflecting the fact that most of the ‘hot’ money had already exited these countries. In fact, the fall in the US dollar and the easing of US interest rates caused exchange rates in the region to strengthen and allowed the downward movement in interest rates, which had begun there in the June quarter, to proceed more quickly. In all these countries, apart from Indonesia, short-term interest rates are either at or below pre-crisis levels. This bodes well for economic conditions in the countries which were hardest hit by the crisis, some of which appear to be seeing some stabilisation now in economic activity. Their recovery is, nonetheless, likely to be gradual. ", " Elsewhere in the world, the underlying economic environment has changed little. Japan remains in recession, though with some hopeful signs that policy action may begin to assist in setting the scene for a recovery. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Europe continues</span> to expand, but with large disparities in economic performance among countries. The biggest change, however, is the emergence of question marks over the outlook for the US economy, arising from the possibility that the sudden risk aversion evident internationally might extend to domestic US financial activity, amplifying forces already at work to produce a slowing in US growth. It is by no means clear that such an outcome will eventuate, not least because the Federal Reserve responded pre-emptively to the possibility by easing monetary policy on two occasions. But it has to be acknowledged that uncertainty about the US, and therefore the global, outlook has recently been greater than for some years. ", " Australian financial markets in the past six months have continued to be affected by global developments. This was most evident in the exchange rate, with the Australian dollar coming under a couple of bouts of intense speculative selling pressure which drove it to new lows against the US dollar. Several countries experiencing similar pressures raised interest rates sharply in response. In Australia's case, the Bank judged that, on this occasion, the most appropriate way for it to deal with the exchange rate pressures was by intervention in the foreign exchange market, since the selling pressures reflected speculative activity rather than any loss of confidence in policy settings in Australia. The Bank undertook two main rounds of intervention, in May/June and August/September. Overall, the Australian financial system has so far come through the global turmoil without serious mishap. ", " The Australian economy has also weathered the first year and a half of a very difficult international environment exceptionally well, despite a quite substantial loss of export sales to Asia. On the most recent data, real GDP growth was running at a pace of around 4 per cent in late 1997 and through the first half of 1998. Growth is now likely to be noticeably lower than that, though indications confirming this are rather fewer than might have been expected thus far. Business confidence has fallen a little, but there are few signs at present of any abrupt and widespread scaling back of actual or planned activities. Certain sectors of the economy – notably manufacturing and mining – are finding conditions quite tough, but other areas continue to expand. At the same time, inflation has remained low, and over the most recent 12 months has been below the Bank's medium-term target. ", " These favourable outcomes owe something to the economy's own capacity to adjust to changed circumstances, including the success of exporters in finding new markets. But macroeconomic policy has also made an important contribution to the favourable outcome. The task for monetary policy has been to try to minimise the damage to the economy from the Asian crisis, and to ensure that the medium-term inflation target is achieved. It was always recognised that the first of these would involve some decline in the exchange rate. At the same time, it is well known that such periods of adjustment can often be traumatic, engendering financial and economic uncertainty, because it is in the nature of markets that financial prices are liable to overshoot. Instability in the exchange rate can itself damage confidence and disrupt business planning. An overly large decline in the exchange rate, if persistent, can also increase the risk of a rapid increase in inflation. ", " Despite these risks, this period of adjustment has to date occurred with comparatively little disruption to the domestic economy and financial conditions. Steadiness in monetary policy settings has contributed to this. Policy has had room to adopt this approach in this episode, unlike other episodes in Australia's history, mainly because of the success in maintaining low inflation and reasonable growth over recent years and the continued confidence of markets in the framework for macroeconomic policies generally. ", " The coming year looks as though it will be no less challenging for the Australian economy, and for monetary policy. With developments in the world economy again likely to be influenced by sharp changes or reversals in financial markets, the outlook can change over quite short periods. Even interpretations of the US outlook, which will be so important to Australia's growth next year, are subject to quite frequent revisions. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, it is hard to see circumstances in which growth in Australia will not decline somewhat from the good outcomes achieved in 1997 and the first half of 1998. At this stage, and given current exchange rates, the Bank still anticipates some further gradual rise in the annual rate of inflation as higher prices for imported products are gradually passed through. It appears unlikely, however, that the inflation target will be exceeded, given that domestic cost increases remain quiescent. ", " Monetary policy is seeking to steer a relatively steady path through these frequent changes in outlook and market sentiment. In evaluating current settings, the Bank takes into account not only the level of official interest rates, but also those faced by borrowers (which have declined over the past year), the level of the exchange rate, which is assisting exporters, and the state of asset and credit markets. This combination seems to have been broadly appropriate for the economy's evolving conjuncture, but as usual, policy settings will remain under continual review in light of changing international and domestic circumstances. ", " The first signs that the financial turmoil was spreading beyond the emerging Asian markets came in the June quarter when markets in Japan came under pressure. The channels through which this contagion occurred were partly financial, since Asian economies had been the destination of much Japanese investment, but also included economic links. Asian countries had been very important export markets for Japanese firms and the rapid weakening in their economies exacerbated the recessionary conditions in Japan. The subsequent loss of confidence in Japanese policy-making saw the yen and the share market weaken sharply, and Japanese long bond yields fell below 1 per cent (Graph 1). As well as the weakening economy, the fall in the yen reflected extraordinarily low Japanese interest rates that gave rise to the so-called ‘yen-carry’ trade, which involved borrowing yen and converting the proceeds into higher yielding assets in other currencies. Large speculative positions were built up in this way by international banks and hedge funds. ", " As the yen weakened, it put pressure on the competitiveness of Asian countries and raised fears of further devaluations in the region including, importantly, China and Hong Kong. As noted below, the Australian dollar also became caught up in this. ", " It was against this background that the US Fed intervened to support the yen in mid June, causing it to strengthen from 147 to 134. This took pressure off other currencies for a time, including the Australian dollar and, by July, international markets had become quite settled. ", " The calm was again disturbed in August when Russia devalued and announced a moratorium on foreign debt repayments. There had been signs of increasing problems in Russia since late May, but investors drew comfort from the assumption that, since Russia was on an IMF program it would not devalue, let alone default. In the event, this confidence was misplaced. The rouble lost three-quarters of its value against the US dollar, short-term interest rates rose, at the worst of the crisis to about 160 per cent, and share prices fell heavily. Major Russian financial institutions collapsed as the crisis deepened. ", " The debt moratorium and rouble devaluation caused heavy losses to banks and hedge funds. Moreover, because the move also made investors suspicious of other emerging markets, credit spreads widened elsewhere, particularly in Latin America. Up until then, countries in Latin America had been only tangentially affected by the global turmoil, but threads common to crises elsewhere rapidly appeared in August: intense downward pressure on currencies, sharp rises in interest rates, and heavy falls in equity markets, with share prices in the region down by an average of 35 per cent from late July to early September. ", " Brazil was the main focus. With the economic fundamentals – especially the budgetary position – viewed as weaker than in other large Latin American economies, it was subject to strong exchange rate pressures, despite a rise in short-term interest rates to around 40 per cent. Since mid 1998, Brazil's foreign reserves have halved, to US$40 billion. One concern was that if the <em>real</em> were devalued, other Latin American countries, which had been successfully pursuing orthodox macroeconomic policies, might also be knocked off course by contagion effects of the sort evident in Asia in 1997. To prevent this, the IMF, with strong US support, is negotiating a package of support for Brazil. ", " Asian markets seemed generally detached from this phase of the crisis, with the exception of Hong Kong where hedge funds took aggressive short positions in August, both in the foreign exchange and equity markets. The move aimed to profit either from a fall in the exchange rate or, more likely, a weakening in the share market as interest rates rose in response to exchange rate pressures. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority responded by intervening in both the foreign exchange market and the equity market to prevent speculative profits being realised. This approach was successful in pushing share prices higher, and causing speculators to retreat. It received support from the US monetary easings and the fall in the US dollar. ", " By late August, stories were starting to circulate in markets about heavy losses sustained by hedge funds and investment banks as a result of their emerging market activities. A number of firms went public on their financial position, in an attempt to calm investors and bank creditors, but with financial prices still moving against them these early statements of losses proved conservative. By early September, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund run by people that many regarded as the best and brightest of the US financial industry, announced that it had lost virtually all its capital. The extent of its positions were so large that the US Fed concluded that its failure would have systemic implications and it co-ordinated a rescue package involving some of the world's most prominent banks, which had been heavy lenders to LTCM (among other hedge funds). ", " As the situation unwound, there was a sharp fall in the US dollar, averaging 10 per cent in trade-weighted terms, but including a fall of 20 per cent against the Japanese yen. This weakening reflected partly the changed outlook for the US economy and monetary policy, but the move against the yen was also driven by the unwinding of short-yen positions by hedge funds after their credit lines had been cut back. Most of the fall in the US dollar/yen exchange rate took place over two days – 7 and 8 October – in what was the biggest exchange rate change for a major currency pair in such a short period since the move to floating exchange rates in 1973. It took the exchange rate back to its level in mid 1997, before the outbreak of the Asian market crisis, with generally beneficial effects for Asia. ", " At the same time as the dollar fell, signs of stress rapidly appeared in the US financial system, and also in European markets. These took three main forms: ", " The US Federal Reserve reacted to the disruption in US markets, particularly signs that the flow of credit through markets was being curtailed, by easing monetary policy on two occasions. This reflected a sharp turnaround from the Fed's earlier bias (held as recently as July) to tighten. The first of these easings took place at the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting in late September; the second was an inter-meeting move two weeks <span class=\"no-wrap\">later (the first inter-meeting change in monetary policy  since April 1994)</span>. In total, the Federal funds rate was reduced by 0.5 percentage points, to 5 per cent. A number of other countries have also eased in the past month or two. With the exception of Japan and some countries in Europe, all the countries that have eased recently had earlier tightened some time between early 1997 and mid 1998, either because of excessive demand pressures or because of downward pressure on exchange rates (<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). ", " It is, of course, too early to tell whether these policy adjustments will be successful in their broad objectives of stabilising economic activity, but there has clearly been a noticeable calming in markets around the world since they were implemented. Credit spreads in the US and on emerging market debt have come off their peaks, although they remain well above longer-run norms; issues of corporate debt have resumed, after coming to a standstill in early October; and share prices have risen strongly. In short, at this stage markets are showing confidence that the Fed may have acted sufficiently quickly to prevent the pronounced slowing in US economic activity that some had earlier feared. ", " Nonetheless, the risk-taking that characterised the bull market of recent years, which was associated with very low risk premiums, is unlikely to return for some time. Greater wariness about credit quality following the problems incurred by hedge funds and other Wall Street firms means that the boom in financial market activity of the past five years will be curtailed as banks become more cautious, at least for a time, while rebuilding balance sheets. ", " Closer to home, financial markets in the Asian region have recently taken a noticeable turn for the better. Signs of improving market confidence had been evident for some months but the US monetary easings gave this a decided lift. Exchange rates, which at their trough in January this year were down about 50 per cent against the US dollar from mid 1997 levels, have recovered to be down around 30 per cent. Even the Indonesian rupiah has risen strongly, from 15,000 to the US dollar as recently as July to about 8,500 (still, of course, down by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">70 per cent</span> from its pre-crisis levels). Interest rates in most countries have fallen to pre-crisis levels and, in the case of South Korea and Thailand, well below. The exception is Indonesia where interest rates remain very high, although off their peaks. Share markets across the region have risen on average by about 30 per cent since end September, though they are still on average down about 40 per cent from mid 1997 levels. ", " The global turbulence was reflected in Australian markets mainly through the exchange rate. In 1998, there have been three main episodes of pressure on the currency. The first – in January – was associated with problems in the emerging markets of Asia, and was discussed in the previous <em>Semi-Annual Statement</em>. The two subsequent bouts of pressure – in May/June and August/September this year – flowed respectively from events in Japan and Russia (Graph 5). ", " Over the second half of 1997, the Australian dollar had developed quite a close relationship with the yen, and by early 1998, it had become commonplace in markets to talk about the Australian dollar being part of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘yen-bloc’ (Graph 6)</span>. With the yen beginning to weaken more noticeably in the June quarter, as the economic outlook for Japan deteriorated and speculators became confident in shorting the yen, the Australian dollar began to fall more quickly as well. ", " The Bank never subscribed to this ‘yen-bloc’ view of the Australian dollar, as the model underlying it seemed to be flawed to the extent that the economic performance of the two economies was very different despite the strong trade links, making it difficult for the close relationship of the currencies to persist in the longer term. Nonetheless, the Bank did not seek to prevent the fall in the Australian dollar from February through April as the yen weakened. ", " In mid May, however, the Bank intervened – in a low-key way – in the foreign exchange market, to ensure settled conditions around the time of the Budget. Then, in late May and early June, the Bank returned to support the exchange rate when aggressive tactics by hedge funds, both in the size of their short positions and their market behaviour, caused the exchange rate to start to fall sharply, even against the weakening yen. ", " The Bank intervened as the exchange rate fell towards US60 cents, buying a total of $2.6 billion in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollars</span>. This brought the total intervention during the May/June period to $3.2 billion. The size of the intervention reflected the scale of the speculative bets put in place against the Australian dollar at this time. However, the selling pressure was such that the Bank's purchases were sufficient, initially, only to slow the fall in the exchange rate, which eventually reached US58.2 cents. One consequence of the Bank's intervention, however, was that speculators were left with substantially larger short positions, at a less profitable exchange rate, than they generally expected. As events unfolded, this set the stage for the Australian dollar's later rise, as substantial short covering of the Australian dollar also took place when the joint intervention was undertaken by US and Japanese authorities to strengthen the yen. By July, the Australian dollar had regained US63 cents, where it had been in May before the attack. ", " The period of calm proved brief. The outbreak of the Russian crisis in August, which was judged by markets to have potential negative implications for commodity prices due to possible dumping by Russia, again caused the exchange rate to weaken. Further, the Australian dollar was used by hedge funds and other speculators as a vehicle to hedge exposures in other, less liquid, markets where they had been caught. The exchange rate moved down to around US55 cents. On this occasion, the vulnerability of the Australian dollar was highlighted by the fact that the Bank of Canada raised interest rates to support the Canadian dollar, often seen as a close substitute for the Australian dollar. The Bank did not raise interest rates, but again bought Australian dollars over late August/ early September – $0.7 billion in total – a process which, on this occasion, moved the exchange rate noticeably higher. ", " The exchange rate steadied during September at a little under US60 cents but then rose sharply in October when hedge funds scrambled to cover positions following losses sustained as the yen rose sharply against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span>. The rise in early October of about US6 cents over eight days was the largest appreciation in a similar period since the Australian dollar was floated in December 1983. The reduction in US interest rates, to a level on a par with Australian rates, also helped by closing the differential that had previously favoured the US dollar. ", " The exchange rate had settled around US63 cents by early November, up by 14 per cent from its low in late August. Over the same period, it weakened against the surging yen (by 7 per cent), which limited the rise in the exchange rate in trade-weighted terms to around 4 per cent. The trade-weighted index remained 5 per cent below its level in early May, and around 10 per cent below its level in early 1997. ", " The cash (policy) rate target has remained at 5 per cent, where it has been since mid 1997. Market yields in Australia, however, have fluctuated in response to the changing pressures on the exchange rate, and with the moves in US monetary policy. Until late in May, short-term market yields were a little lower than the cash rate as investors continued to price in the possibility that the five easings between mid 1996 and mid 1997 would be followed by a sixth. These expectations were revised abruptly, however, as the exchange rate fell in early <span class=\"no-wrap\">June (Graph 7)</span>. A similar pattern of short-term interest rates was evident in late August and early September as the exchange rate again fell heavily. In both episodes, the yield on 90-day bills moved well above 5.5 per cent, reflecting strong expectations that monetary policy would be tightened to steady the exchange rate. This was quickly reversed as talk of the possibility of a US easing emerged and the Australian dollar appreciated. The yield on 90-day bank bills fell to below 5 per cent by the time of the first easing in US monetary policy at end September. It fell further when the Fed eased a second time, and subsequently remained below the cash rate, indicating some expectation of an easing, though not necessarily in the immediate future. ", " The bout of exchange rate pressure in early June also saw bond yields rise from their then cyclical low, of about 5.35 per cent, to 5.8 per cent. The rise in yields at the time of the exchange rate weakness late in August was larger, with the yield on 10-year bonds rising above 6 per cent, but this proved very brief as the wide differential relative to US bonds quickly attracted buyers. Since then, the continued drop in bond yields globally, the recovery in the Australian dollar, and the buoyancy in short-term interest rates have seen bond yields in Australia rally to new lows (Graph 8). The yield on 10-year bonds fell to about 4.85 per cent in mid October, their lowest level since February 1965, before settling a little above 5 per cent. ", " Australian interest relativities to the US have changed significantly over the past six months. At the short end, the easings by the Fed have resulted in the US policy rate moving into line with that in Australia; Australian short-term rates had been 50 basis points below those in the United States since July 1997. At the long end, bond yields in Australia moved down by more than those in other major countries early in 1998, to a level below US rates by May. As the exchange rate then weakened, local bond yields moved back above US rates, reaching a differential of about 100 basis points late in August. Subsequently, this differential has narrowed to about 30 basis points. ", " There is some evidence of widening margins within Australia on lesser quality credits. New issues of corporate debt have also declined. But these developments are on a more modest scale than in US debt markets, partly reflecting the fact that securities markets represent a much more limited source of funds for Australian corporates. While Australian banks are reported to have cut back on interbank exposures to foreign (particularly US) banks, lending to Australian companies and households remains healthy (see chapter on ‘<a href=\"#financial-conditions\">Financial Conditions</a>’ below). There is no sign of a credit crunch developing in Australia. ", " Prospects for global economic growth and stability depend even more heavily than usual on the United States. At the same time, uncertainty over the outlook for the US economy has increased over recent months. ", " This is not because of the slowing in US growth: evidence for this had been accumulating over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">course of 1998</span> and recent developments were in line with expectations. Some slowdown was overdue because through both 1996 and 1997 US GDP had expanded at nearly 4 per cent per annum, whereas the US economy's potential growth rate is normally thought to be about 2 to 2½ per cent. Even though this had been accompanied by a better inflation performance than might have been expected on the basis of historical relationships, a slowdown in growth has been seen as desirable, in order to prevent, at some stage, an increase in US inflation, with then a heightened risk of recession. The only real question had been whether a tightening of US monetary policy would be required to bring such a slowing about. As was noted above, as recently as July, the Federal Reserve had signalled that it was close to such a tightening. ", " Such a step proved unnecessary as evidence of the US economy's deceleration became clearer. Although the third quarter national accounts recorded a stronger GDP increase than expected, at 3.4 per cent over the year, there are a number of signs that growth is easing (Graph 9). US exports, which had grown at around 10 per cent over 1997, have declined during 1998. This is partly as a result of weaker world markets but also due to the high value of the US dollar; import penetration into the US economy has increased for the same reason. These effects have had a noticeable impact on the manufacturing sector, where output growth has fallen sharply and employment stopped growing. It remains true that other parts of the US economy show strength: service-related industries are continuing to expand at a strong pace, and employment gains continue; and housing starts rose to their highest level in over 10 years in the September quarter, helped by low interest rates. But overall, there are reasonably clear signs that the strong growth of recent years is now giving way to a more moderate pace of expansion. ", " As noted above, some slowing was anticipated, and desired, by US policy-makers. What concerned them during September and October was the possibility that with these forces already in operation to dampen growth, a sudden desire to shed credit risk by lenders, amid a general atmosphere of financial market panic, would increase the risk of an unnecessarily sharp slowing. The events described in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#financial-markets\">Financial Markets</a>’ above saw, for the first time, questions raised about the strength of some large US financial institutions. It was this, rather than the possible trade linkages to emerging markets (which are not as important to the major countries as financial linkages) which appeared to prompt the two pre-emptive easings of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in September and October. ", " There has subsequently been much discussion of a possible ‘credit crunch’. That term is usually taken to mean not just a rise in the price of credit to risky borrowers, but a serious lack of availability of credit at virtually any price even to large numbers of credit-worthy borrowers, driven by lenders' desire to protect their own balance sheets. While there has been some increase in the cost of credit to domestic borrowers, as described in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#financial-markets\">Financial Markets</a>’ above, the recent events in the US could not be described in those terms, nor is it clear that such an outcome is in prospect. Even so, the outlook for the US economy is more uncertain than it has been for some years. In the period immediately ahead, continuing employment growth, albeit below the pace seen earlier in the year, and the decline in the cost of personal finance stemming from the low level of US bond yields, should help to sustain consumption growth. On the other hand, with share prices having performed strongly over recent years, US households' spending has grown faster than income, savings rates have declined to very low levels and debt burdens increased. That conjuncture could mean that consumer demand might be prone to retrenchment were there to be significant further declines in financial wealth. ", " The expansion in Europe is continuing, though it remains quite uneven. The French economy has been growing strongly, led by the expansion in investment and consumption. German growth has been less consistent, with weak consumer demand; business confidence has declined in Germany in recent months. In the United Kingdom, activity is slowing from above-trend growth rates. Several smaller countries are recording much higher rates of growth, but are nonetheless reducing interest rates in the run-up to the commencement of European Monetary Union on 1 January next year. Overall, the monetary stance of Europe is quite accommodative, and is becoming more so. ", " The exposure of European financial institutions to emerging markets is quite substantial (Table 3), though this has not, so far, been the subject of discussion in Europe to the same extent as in the United States. ", " The Japanese economy remains extremely weak (Graph 10). Output has been contracting since the <span class=\"no-wrap\">middle of 1997</span>, and the latest national accounts data (for the June quarter) showed declines in almost every major category of expenditure. Employment has weakened and unemployment has risen to levels previously unknown in modern Japan. With falling incomes, and prices continuing to decline, households have not been inclined to expand consumption expenditure, despite the income tax cuts. Private investment expenditure also continues to decline, a response to rising excess capacity, and the declining availability of credit. ", " Japanese policy-makers face an extraordinarily difficult task in turning the situation around. Their approach has three major parts. The first is the maintenance of extremely low interest rates. The Bank of Japan's overnight rate was further reduced in September to 0.25 per cent. The second element is an expansion in public spending. An amount equivalent to around 2 per cent of GDP is scheduled to be spent on public works in the second half of this year – income tax cuts equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP are also scheduled – and there are now early signs of this spending having an impact in the construction sector. The government is also considering further spending initiatives and further income tax cuts. There has been a number of such packages over the 1990s. They have usually been effective in adding to growth while they were in operation, but in recent years the private sector of the Japanese economy has not gained sufficient momentum to cope with the loss of fiscal stimulus once the packages were completed. ", " One reason for that has been the state of the Japanese banking system, which has been a serious constraint on the economy for some time. Credit outstanding has declined over the past year, as banks have sought to combat serious problems of asset quality by restraining new loans (though some of the decline in outstandings is due to write-downs of bad loans). This process constrains borrowers, and dampens economic activity, which in turn risks a further worsening of banks' loan books. ", " The third element in the policy response has been a series of measures aimed at assisting the banking system to cope with its problem loans. For a long time the effectiveness of these measures was hampered by the reluctance of individual banks to accept assistance, and disagreement at the political level on details of implementation. A new package passed the Diet in October, apparently overcoming the worst of the political stand-off. The total amount of funding (some of which has been held over from earlier and now superseded packages) is <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>60 trillion, equivalent to 12 per cent of Japanese GDP. While the total size of bad loans in the banking system is larger than that, this represents a substantial resource to assist in strengthening the banks. The process of implementation will, as always, be critical; it is too early to tell as yet how this is proceeding. ", " There are signs that in those east Asian economies where economic contractions have been largest over the past year, activity may now be stabilising (Table 4, Graph 11). In countries which began to slow a little later, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, it may be too early to reach this conclusion. ", " One factor which will be helping a number of the countries in Asia is that the decline in exchange rates has conferred a substantial boost to their exporters. Export values measured in US dollars have been flat, or in some cases fallen, over the past year. It is possible that in volume terms exports from Asia to the rest of the world are expanding noticeably, with falling US dollar prices and a decline in trade between countries within the region explaining the relatively weak US dollar value of exports. Nonetheless, a lack of access to trade credit may still be hampering export efforts, and of course the price of imports into the region, which are often used in the production of goods for export, has risen sharply. ", " Prospects for some stabilisation of domestic demand in many countries in Asia also appear to be improving. As noted in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#financial-markets\">Financial Markets</a>’, interest rates in most instances have been declining, and in a number of cases short-term market rates are now below those which prevailed prior to the onset of the crisis in the middle of last year. Budgetary restraint is also being eased, including in those countries under IMF programs. These trends are being assisted by the fall in the US dollar against the yen and the decline in US interest rates, which have eased the disparities in competitiveness between the countries in Asia, and allowed exchange rates against the dollar to be maintained at less cost to domestic economies. ", " Hence the short-term outlook for economic activity in east Asia, while hardly bright, appears to be improving. Prerequisites for a continued trend towards recovery are that markets for Asian goods in major countries continue to grow and remain open and that adequate domestic demand in Asia is sustained. The latter must be complemented by efforts to restructure and strengthen banking and corporate sectors, so that the benefits of more expansionary domestic policies can flow through to businesses and consumers. Progress appears to be being made on these fronts, though much remains to be done. ", " Economic indicators so far in 1998 have been a little stronger than might have been expected given the deterioration in external conditions. Over the year to the June quarter, real output increased by just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>, with slightly stronger growth experienced in the non-farm economy (Table 5). Growth has been sufficient to generate some solid gains in employment over the past year. ", " There are a number of signs, however, that the economy is shifting to a pace of growth somewhat below trend. Business investment weakened in the June quarter, and investment in housing is levelling off, although housing affordability remains high. Stock-building is likely to be lower in the second half of 1998 than in the first half, contributing to some weakening in the growth of production. At the same time, household expenditure has continued to grow, driven in large part by employment gains which have boosted incomes, and by strong household borrowing. ", " The external environment remains the major source of uncertainty. Exports have been a drag on growth during the past year, primarily reflecting declines in exports to east Asia. Although this influence has to some extent been offset by increased sales to other regions, the external environment could become more difficult still particularly if growth in the US economy slows more sharply than currently expected. These uncertainties are also making it difficult for businesses to plan ahead, particularly in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Given the weaker external outlook and resultant uncertainties for the domestic economy, it is likely that overall growth in the Australian economy will decline over the year ahead. ", " After a period of very strong growth in the second half of 1997, the rate of growth of private consumption has returned to something more like its longer-term trend. In real terms, retail spending increased by 1½ per cent in the September quarter after increasing slightly in the previous quarter (Graph 12). In part this uneven pattern reflects difficulties in capturing the changing seasonal pattern of retail sales around mid-year, and a more reliable indicator of the trend can be gained by taking the two quarters together; this suggests that sales over the recent period have been increasing at an annual rate of around 3 per cent. Spending has been supported by increases in household borrowings and by the recent pick-up in income and employment growth. ", " Retailers have experienced quite disparate conditions. Sales of food, hospitality, clothing and soft-goods have been strong, while household goods retailers have experienced falling sales over the past year. This pattern is a little surprising given the strength of housing investment, and may reflect a lag between stronger housing activity and expenditure on household items. If so, stronger spending on these items could be expected over the next few months; this would be consistent with results of the Consumer Sentiment survey, which show that a majority of consumers still feel it is a good time to buy a major household item. On the other hand, it is possible that increased car affordability has encouraged households to devote a greater share of disposable income to car purchases, and to defer purchases of household goods to some extent. ", " Over the year to June, spending on motor vehicles increased by 19 per cent. More recent data suggest that motor vehicle registrations have fallen back after their mid-year surge, though they remain at a high level. The immediate factors behind the very strong growth in sales of new cars have been a combination of competitive pricing and attractive financing deals. Competition in the car market was initially led by some imported brands which pressured domestic producers to reduce prices, and there has also been some aggressive discounting by dealers. Much of the strength in motor vehicle sales has been in the imported component, with vehicle imports rising by about 50 per cent over the past year. Low interest rates have seen a substantial increase in borrowing to finance vehicle purchases. ", " Longer-term factors also seem supportive of a high level of demand for cars. The average age of the Australian car fleet is relatively high by international standards, and has been rising since the 1980s. This suggests that new car sales during the 1990s have generally not been sufficient to replace scrapped cars as well as satisfy new demand, and that this difference between car sales and total demand has been met by extending the age of existing vehicles. The current level of motor vehicle registrations is much closer to what would be required to satisfy new demand. ", " Consumer sentiment, as measured in the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey, has declined over the past year but remains above its long-run average. Continuing a trend that has been in evidence for much of the year, there is a contrast between attitudes to the economy as a whole and assessments of consumers' personal financial situations – consumers remain quite up-beat about their own circumstances while showing less confidence about the economy (Graph 13). Consumers' expectations about unemployment deteriorated slightly in October and remain below average. ", " The easing in consumption expenditure in the first half of 1998 occurred in parallel with a slowing in household income. Real household disposable income increased by 3 per cent over the year to June, but at an annual rate of only 1 per cent in the first half of 1998. With spending still growing faster than income, however, the savings ratio has declined. The more recent healthy gains in employment should support income growth and spending, and may enable consumers to lift savings somewhat. Recognition of increased household wealth associated with the AMP demutualisation should be having its main effect in the second half of 1998 and will also be a supportive influence for household spending. ", " Forward indicators of housing activity suggest that housing demand is now easing, although existing work in the pipeline should support some further expansion in construction activity over the next few quarters. Dwelling investment expenditure increased in the June quarter, to be 12 per cent higher than a year ago and around <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span> above its level at the start of the recovery in late 1996. As is usually the case, growth so far in this upswing has been mainly driven by construction of new dwellings, but investment in alterations and additions, which tends to be less cyclical, has also made an important contribution (Graph 14). There has also been a medium-term trend towards increased building of medium-density dwellings, probably reflecting demographic trends and increased community preference for that form of accommodation. ", " Loan approvals for housing have fluctuated considerably in recent months but have shown little net growth for some time. They remain at a high level, with the value of loan approvals over the past year having averaged around a third higher than the cyclical trough. The overall rise reflects a combination of increased numbers of loans approved and growth in the average loan size, which in turn reflects rising house prices and increases in the size and quality of homes constructed. ", " Trends in local government building approvals present a similar picture. By the middle of 1998, building approvals had increased by around 30 per cent, in terms of numbers of dwellings, from their cyclical trough, and by around 50 per cent in terms of total value. In recent months, however, building approvals have declined, and in the September quarter the number of approvals was 11 per cent below the June quarter level. This result seems consistent with the easing in demand suggested by loan approvals, although the recent figures may be less reliable than usual. Governments in New South Wales and Queensland have recently permitted private agencies to issue building approvals. This change has resulted in some local councils being slow in supplying complete building approvals data to the ABS. ", " Movements in house prices continue to reflect rather different demand conditions across capital cities. House price increases over the past year have been strongest in Sydney and Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, Perth and Adelaide. Within the Sydney and Melbourne markets, house price increases were initially led by strong rises in prices in the inner suburbs. These pressures have clearly eased in the past six months, even though prices in the middle and outer suburbs, which began to pick up somewhat later in the cycle, are still increasing. ", " The current housing cycle is different from previous episodes over the past two decades in some important respects. In particular, the run-up in housing approvals and commencements has not been as large, relative to underlying demand, as in previous cycles. The current upswing appears to be reaching a peak with a level of activity close to the medium-term level of underlying demand, in contrast to previous cycles when peak activity considerably exceeded underlying demand. An important reason for this is that there was not a particularly large backlog of excess demand at the time the upswing commenced. Another characteristic of the current upswing is that a greater proportion of activity is now accounted for by alterations and additions, which tends to be less cyclical than new construction. Finally, unlike previous cycles, the apparent peak in housing activity is occurring at a time of low interest rates and high levels of housing affordability, which should continue to support demand. All of these factors should make for a more dampened cyclical behaviour of the housing sector than has been typical in the past. ", " While production continued to expand at a solid pace over the past year, national accounts data suggest that a significant part of overall production growth in the first half of 1998 was absorbed by stock-building. The increase in stocks was concentrated in the manufacturing sector, reflecting re-stocking after inventories were run down during 1997, although the slowing in manufactured exports may also have contributed. Despite the high level of stock-building, stocks-to-sales ratios of businesses do not look to be excessive; nor do surveys suggest any widespread intention to reduce stocks. Nonetheless, the high rate of stock-building seen in the first half of the year is unlikely to continue, a factor which would contribute to some dampening in the growth of production. ", " Measures of general business sentiment have been steadier in recent months after declining during the first half of this year. The NAB survey for the September quarter shows that indicators of expected business conditions, encompassing profitability, employment and trading conditions, rose slightly after weakening in June (Graph 15). Like consumers, businesses tend to be more pessimistic about the general economic outlook than in their assessments of their own circumstances. Exporters have shown the sharpest deterioration in confidence. The ACCI-Westpac survey of the manufacturing sector, which is quite heavily exposed to external demand, shows a bigger deterioration in confidence since the beginning of the year than recorded in other surveys, but also points to some stabilisation in confidence more recently. The Dun and Bradstreet survey, which gives greater weight to the service industries, gives a more positive reading overall, pointing to an expected rebound in sales and new orders in the December quarter. In general, the fact that most measures of confidence have stopped deteriorating in the recent period may reflect a recognition that firms' sales to the domestic market have continued to expand despite the deterioration in the international environment. ", " Business confidence may also have been shored up by stronger profit results recently. Following a fairly protracted period of moderate growth in profits, businesses have experienced some recovery in profitability over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span>, according to official data. Total profits of the corporate sector, as measured by gross operating surplus, increased by 11 per cent over 1997/98 after increasing by just 1 per cent over 1996/97. This increase has seen gross operating surplus as a share of GDP rise to 15.6 per cent, somewhat above its decade average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">14.8 per cent</span>. The strength in profits reflects the strong increase in domestic demand over the past year, which has helped businesses to achieve some good results particularly in the wholesale and retail, transport and storage, and services sectors. ", " Growth in profits of small business, as measured by the gross operating surplus of unincorporated enterprises, has also picked up in the past six months but has been more moderate than that for the corporate sector. As a share of GDP, profits of small businesses before interest, taxes and depreciation have remained relatively steady and at a level a little below their average for the past decade. The current low level of interest rates has contributed to a level of profits after interest at around 6½ per cent of GDP, marginally higher than their decade average. ", " Despite the resilience of profits in the March and June quarters, all of the major business surveys have indicated a downward revision in profit expectations for the next 12 months. In net-balance terms, profit expectations from both the NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys are below their respective long-run averages, though well above their troughs of the last recession. ", " Business investment spending weakened in the first half of 1998. After allowing for transfers between the public and private sectors, new investment by businesses declined by 7 per cent over the first half of the year, with the weakness concentrated in the plant and equipment component. Despite the decline, the level of business investment in the June quarter was still 2 per cent higher than a year earlier, reflecting strong growth in equipment investment in the second half of 1997. ", " The recent decline in business investment comes after a period of around five years of strong growth during which investment in real terms had increased at an average annual rate of 10 per cent. Notwithstanding these strong increases over an extended period, businesses do not generally appear to be over-stretched in their investment spending at present. The upswing in business investment, coming off a low base in the early 1990s, has only returned investment spending to a level around its historical average in relation to GDP (Graph 16). This is true for both the plant and equipment and the construction components of investment spending. Other factors would appear supportive of further investment growth: corporate profitability is at above-average levels, as noted above, and interest rates are low. In these circumstances, the main immediate risk to the investment outlook would arise from the effect of the international economic downturn on business confidence. ", " Business surveys are providing mixed readings as to investment intentions at present. Estimates from the latest ABS Capital Expenditure survey for 1998/99, conducted in late July and early August, suggest that, at this stage, businesses are still planning to increase their investment spending in the year ahead, though at a more moderate pace than has been typical in recent years (Graph 17). According to the survey, the expected level of capital expenditure over the year ahead was 12 per cent higher than the corresponding expectation recorded the previous year. This result, which refers to nominal spending, would imply a moderate increase in real terms, allowing for the expected increase in prices of imported investment goods. ", " Most industries reported expectations of increased investment spending in 1998/99, with mining a notable exception. The recent scaling back of planned mining investment appears to reflect both the high levels reached in 1997 and weaker demand conditions in east Asia. The overall strength of the Capital Expenditure survey is somewhat at odds with business surveys that have reported a downgrading in investment plans. The NAB survey, for example, reported that capital expenditure plans have been revised down sharply in September after being largely unchanged over the previous few quarters. ", " Leading indicators of investment in buildings and structures (which represents around one quarter of total business investment) continue to be quite positive. Private non-residential building approvals picked up solidly in the June quarter (Graph 18). While these approvals have eased back in the September quarter, they remain at a level which would be supportive of further growth in construction activity over 1998/99. The recent strength in building approvals continues to be concentrated in New South Wales, which has accounted for nearly 45 per cent of total approvals over the past six months. The large stock of work yet-to-be-done for both non-residential buildings and engineering construction projects should also help underpin growth in construction activity in the near term. The strength in this area continues to be driven by a number of large private-sector infrastructure projects along with several large mining projects currently underway although, as noted above, planned investment in new mining projects is now being curtailed. ", " The momentum in the domestic economy has contributed to a significant pick-up in employment growth over the past year. Over the year to September, total employment increased by 2.4 per cent, compared with an increase of 1.1 per cent the previous year (Graph 19). The most recent monthly figures suggest that employment continued to expand at a good pace through the September quarter, although not too much significance should be attributed to individual monthly movements. Since the start of the year, employment growth has been broadly matched by an increase in labour-force participation, with the result that the unemployment rate has remained steady, around an average of just over 8 per cent. In September the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 per cent, down by around 0.5 percentage points from the level prevailing in mid 1997. ", " The pick-up in demand for labour over the past year has been most evident in those industries which are usually most sensitive to the business cycle. Retail employment rose sharply in the three months to August, while employment in the construction industry is now 10 per cent higher than a year ago. In contrast, manufacturing employment has declined in each of the past four quarters, probably reflecting the impact of lower overseas sales by manufacturers. Public-sector employment, which declined during 1997, has risen slightly in recent quarters. ", " Full-time employment has performed well recently, increasing by 2.2 per cent over the past year and at a slightly faster pace over the past six months (Graph 20). This is a substantial pick-up from the flat or declining level of full-time employment recorded until late last year. Part-time employment has maintained a steadier upward trend in the past few years. The mix of employment growth between these two components typically reflects a combination of cyclical and longer-term influences. Most of the cyclical behaviour of employment in recent years has been accounted for by the full-time component, partly reflecting a greater-than-average intensity of full-time employment in industries that are cyclically sensitive. In contrast, the dominant longer-term influence is the more rapid average rate of growth of part-time employment. This reflects both changing work practices and an increasing community preference for part-time work. ", " The pick-up in employment growth recorded over the past year follows a period of above-average growth in output, and appears consistent with the average relationship between output and employment evident <span class=\"no-wrap\">over the 1990s</span>. This lag accounts for much of the short-run variability in labour productivity. Thus, while activity growth eased slightly in the June quarter, the recent acceleration in employment resulted in a reduction in labour productivity growth from the exceptionally high rates recorded over 1997. Over the four quarters to June 1998, productivity per person in the non-farm sector increased by around 2 per cent, close to its average annual rate of increase during the 1990s. ", " Although businesses appear to be anticipating a decline in output growth, surveys do not seem to suggest that declines in confidence are having an independent dampening effect on labour demand. According to the NAB survey, businesses' employment expectations have declined somewhat since the start of the year but picked up in the September quarter (Graph 21). The survey also suggests that, like other aspects of business conditions, firms remain more optimistic as to their own likely employment levels than they do about the outlook for the economy more generally. Forward indicators of labour demand are still pointing to further gains in employment in the short-term. The ANZ and DEETYA measures of vacancies continue to rise, and in September both were more than 15 per cent higher than a year earlier. The ABS job vacancies series declined markedly in the September quarter, reversing sharp increases in March and June, but still showed private-sector vacancies to be 7 per cent higher over the past year. ", " Farm output declined by 4.3 per cent in 1997/98, after a strong outcome including record crop production in the previous financial year. Following drought-breaking rains in the middle of the year, farm production is expected to rebound strongly in 1998/99. Although there has been some damage to crops from excess rainfall and frosts in some areas, the size of this year's wheat crop is currently anticipated by ABARE to be 21.9 million tonnes, which would be 13 per cent higher than the previous year and the second highest on record. ", " Conditions in the wool market have deteriorated as demand from the major wool-consuming countries (Japan, Korea, China and western Europe) weakens further. Wool exports fell by over 10 per cent in 1997/98. These conditions have prompted the Federal Government to propose legislation that would freeze sales of wool from the stockpile. The Government is also considering the possible sale of the stockpile. Improved saleyard prices, dry seasonal conditions in parts of Australia and the downturn in live cattle exports resulted in higher meat production in 1997/98. Meat exports to Japan and the US rose strongly in the year, offsetting the weakness in exports to South Korea and Indonesia. ", " Exports have weakened in response to the slowdown in Asia, though the ability of many exporters to find alternative markets for their products has meant that this reduction has been contained in some cases. Non-rural export volumes (excluding gold), fell in the December and March quarters, which was the period in which the loss of sales to Asia was concentrated. They then rose in the June quarter, but appear to have fallen again in the September quarter, to be about 4 per cent lower than a year earlier. This compares with an average annual rate of growth of 9 per cent recorded over 1990–96. Rural export volumes, which are largely supply determined, fell over the first half of the year, but from an historically high level (reflecting record farm production in 1996/97) and appear to have performed well in the September quarter. ", " The decline in exports to Asia was fairly widespread across countries, but particularly marked in the case of sales to Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. In contrast, exports to the US and EU have increased sharply since the Asian downturn (Graph 22). Excluding gold, the value of exports rose by around 22 per cent to the US, and by around 17 per cent to the EU over the four quarters to September. The share of these two destinations in Australia's total exports rose from 19 per cent in 1996/97 to around 22 per cent in the first three quarters of 1998. Exports to Japan strengthened through 1997, but have weakened subsequently. ", " Diversion has been far more pronounced for resource exports than other merchandise exports. In fact, volume growth in resource exports (excluding gold) has been stronger over the past year than it has been through <span class=\"no-wrap\">the 1990s</span>. Most of this growth is in shipments of metal ores and minerals, coal and other mineral fuels, which together account for just under 60 per cent of resource exports. Gold exports also grew solidly over this period, but some of this is explained by re-exports of gold imported from Asia. Since the onset of the Asian crisis, both Australian gold imports and exports have grown strongly due to the re-processing of gold from Asia, and the re-exporting of this gold, mostly to the EU and Switzerland. ", " Exports of services have also been affected by the Asian crisis. As noted in the previous <em>Semi-Annual Statement</em>, tourist arrivals from the most troubled Asian countries fell dramatically in the second half of 1997. These now appear to have stabilised, at about 50 per cent of pre-crisis levels. Arrivals from other countries have shown a slight tendency to increase more quickly, helped by the lower exchange rate, but this has not offset the weakness in Asian tourism. ", " The pattern of departures by Australians appears to have responded to changed price incentives. Overall departures are increasing more quickly, but much of this appears to be explained by an increase in visits to New Zealand and Asia, presumably reflecting exchange rate developments; departures to the US and Europe have declined. ", " Growth in import volumes has slowed. In part this reflects the fact that growth in domestic demand has declined from very high rates in 1997, but a lower exchange rate is probably also playing a role. Imports of goods and services increased at an annual rate of a little under 6 per cent over the first half of 1998, compared with an annual rate of over 9 per cent over the second half of 1997. The most recent trade data suggest a further decline in growth of import volumes in the September quarter. ", " Weaker growth is seen across most of the categories. Growth in consumption imports has declined considerably from its strong start to the year, driven primarily by a levelling off in motor vehicle imports. Growth in imports of capital goods has also slowed, while service import volumes have been falling for some time. ", " As a consequence of the recovery in exports and the slowing growth of imports in the June quarter, the trade deficit narrowed to 1.3 per cent of GDP, from 1.7 per cent in March. This in turn contributed to some improvement in the current account deficit which declined to 4.7 per cent of GDP (Graph 23). Although commodity prices have fallen considerably over the last year (see ‘<a href=\"#commodity-prices\">Commodity  prices</a>’ section), the weaker currency over 1998 has ensured that export prices expressed in Australian dollars have remained reasonably steady. However, the terms of trade are now declining as import prices rise in response to the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. Thus, while export and import volumes have been relatively flat in the September quarter, the deterioration in the terms of trade is likely to result in some widening in the trade deficit, to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1¾ per cent</span> of GDP in the quarter. This will be reflected in the current account deficit. ", " Australia's net foreign liabilities have remained around 60 per cent of GDP over the past two years or so; two-thirds of these liabilities are debt. While a significant proportion of Australia's gross foreign debt is short term and denominated in foreign currencies, the majority of this debt is owed by the official and financial sectors and is largely hedged. While practice among private corporations varies, a significant proportion of their foreign debt has also been hedged, either through financial markets transactions or through ‘natural hedges’ because it is matched by foreign-currency revenues. ", " Australia's ability to service its foreign liabilities, as measured by the ratio of interest and dividend payments to exports, remains near its historical (post-deregulation) average and significantly below the levels over the past few years. The bulk of Australia's net income deficit is accounted for by interest payments on foreign debt. Despite the substantial depreciation of the exchange rate over the past year, the net income deficit as a proportion of exports has been broadly unchanged. This reflects the fact that higher interest payments on net foreign currency debt in $A terms have been broadly matched by higher income receipts on net foreign-currency equity assets. ", " Commodity prices have continued to fall. In SDR terms, Australia's commodity prices are now around 19 per cent below the peak recorded prior to the onset of the Asian crisis (Graph 24). Price falls have been spread across most components, but continue to be most pronounced for rural goods and base metals. In the three months to October, the falls were concentrated in rural goods, whose prices fell by over 9 per cent, and base metals, whose prices fell by 5 per cent. ", " Weaker demand growth in some of the major industrial countries is likely to be the main explanation for these falls. It is sometimes suggested that economic downturns in a number of developing countries may also affect commodity markets substantially. Slower output growth in the emerging markets certainly implies that their own demand for commodities is lower, which at the margin must be exerting downward pressure on prices, but this is still likely to be less important than developments in Japan, the US or Europe. ", " On the supply side, it has been suggested that those emerging markets that produce commodities could seek to acquire foreign exchange by dumping produce onto world markets, reducing prices and disrupting other countries' exports of commodities. Table 7 shows the countries which are important suppliers of some commodities which Australia exports. ", " The extent of these pressures should not be overestimated, however. For one thing, it is not clear how much short-run additional production capacity these producers have. In the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), a need for export income over a number of years had already resulted in a substantial increase in commodity production earlier in this decade. If even higher rates of production were not previously viable, then falling commodity prices will make them less profitable now. These producers also might find it difficult to invest in new plants, which take a considerable time to come on-stream in any event, due to the problems in the financial sectors in many of these countries and the difficulty in attracting foreign capital. ", " In summary, it is not clear that increased supply by emerging market countries will place much additional downward pressure on commodity prices. The outlook for growth in the industrial countries is still likely to have the largest influence on commodity prices. ", " It is worth noting as well that price falls to date are not as large as the falls seen in several previous episodes <span class=\"no-wrap\">(<a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>)</span>, though further declines might yet occur. For example, industry analysts suggest that Japanese steel producers will be seeking lower prices for iron ore and coking coal in negotiations with Australian producers currently under way. ", " Despite the continued weakness in commodity markets, the depreciation in the Australian dollar against the major currencies has meant that, in domestic-currency terms, commodity prices are currently a little above their level prior to the onset of the crisis in Asia. This is supporting the profitability of rural and resource producers. ", " Even though there has not been any change to monetary policy in the past six months, interest rates faced by many borrowers have continued to come down as competition among banks has reduced their margins. For example, the average indicator rate on small business loans fell over the June quarter, from 8.75 per cent to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.7 per cent</span> (Graph 25). Loans secured by residential property generally attract no risk margin and are frequently offered at rates below the average variable rate; predominant indicator rates on residentially secured facilities are 6.9 and 7.2 per cent for term loans and overdrafts respectively. ", " In the case of housing loans, banks' interest rate on standard <em>variable-rate loans</em> has remained largely unchanged, at 6.7 per cent since late 1997, while mortgage managers' variable rates have been steady at 6.3 per cent. However, many banks have recently reduced honeymoon rates by approximately 50 basis points to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.5 per cent</span>, and some mortgage managers have begun to offer these products. With margins on housing loans having narrowed considerably across the board in recent years, financial intermediaries seem to have returned to the strategy of earlier in the 1990s, whereby banks and mortgage managers focused their competitive energies on attracting new customers. ", " Taking a longer-term perspective, since mid 1996, when the first of the five easings in monetary policy took place, rates for a wide range of variable-rate loans have fallen by more than the cash rate. This is illustrated by figures in Table 8, which show movements in these interest rates. The table also includes figures for the overall cost of business loans, where available, which incorporate customer risk margins in addition to the relevant indicator rate. ", " Since mid 1996, the predominant interest rate on standard-variable housing loans has fallen by 3.8 percentage points, or 1.3 percentage points more than the cash rate. The average overall rate paid on small business variable-rate loans has fallen by 3.6 percentage points, or 1.1 percentage points more than the cash rate since mid 1996. Interest rates on these loans are well below the previous cyclical trough in 1993, and in fact are the lowest for about 30 years (Graph 26). ", " Fixed-rate loans, about 20 per cent of banks' total loans, are generally priced from yields of comparable term in swap markets and, accordingly, margins on these loans are better measured relative to movements in swap rates rather than the cash rate. The figures in Table 8 show that, since mid 1996, indicator interest rates on fixed-rate products for terms of three years have moved broadly in line with the swap rate – i.e. margins on these loans have not come down as in the case of variable-rate loans, as they had always been significantly lower. These rates, of course, apply only to new loans. The average interest rate received on all outstanding fixed-rate business loans has fallen by about a percentage point less than the swap rate, because the fall in indicator rates has not yet worked its way through the stock of outstanding loans. ", " Banks have also been aggressive in the personal lending market. While variable interest rates on banks' instalment loans have not changed, those on residentially secured lines of credit – the fastest growing sector of this market – have fallen by 40 basis points, to around 7 per cent, since the start of the year. The interest rate is much lower than that for traditional instalment loans, which average 9.4 per cent if security is offered, and 12.4 per cent if the loan is unsecured. ", " In contrast to loan rates, which have generally fallen by more than the cash rate in recent years, the average interest rate paid by banks on deposits has fallen by less than the cash rate. This is because the cash rate is not a comprehensive measure of banks' <em>total</em> cost of funds, as banks fund their lending from a variety of sources, including retail deposits, wholesale deposits, debt issues and overseas capital markets. Most notably, interest rates on transaction and investment accounts have fallen only slightly, because they were already at low levels. ", " With interest rates on loans falling by more than those on deposits, the interest spread of banks has declined in the past year. The overall interest spread is shown on Graph 27. Since 1996, this spread has declined from <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.8 per cent to 3.2 per cent</span>. This is part of a longer-term decline from around 5.0 per cent in 1980 – an early point in the process of deregulating financial markets in Australia. ", " Measures of real interest rates (defined as nominal interest rates adjusted for expected inflation) continue to suggest that these are below historical averages, as is to be expected when monetary policy is seeking to have an expansionary impact on the economy. While there is no single definitive measure of real interest rates, as they depend on inflation expectations which are not directly observable, several estimates based on either actual past inflation or survey measures of expected inflation are shown in Table 9. Declines in real borrowing rates over recent years reflect a combination of reduced cash rates and compression of intermediaries' lending margins; in recent months there has also been some increase in inflation expectations (discussed in detail in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#inflation-trends-and-prospects\">Inflation Trends and    Prospects</a>’), which also acts to reduce some measures of real interest rates. According to the measures reported in Table 9, real interest rates on standard variable-rate loans both for housing and small business are now below their cyclical troughs reached in the early 1990s, by a percentage point or more. Real cash rates are above their trough but lower than their average over the past five years. Real interest rates as measured by yields on indexed bonds are also near historical lows at about 3.5 per cent, roughly a percentage point below their average for the 1990s. ", " Credit growth has eased slightly in recent months (Table 10), although the overall expansion of credit, at a rate of 10.9 per cent over the past year, remains well in excess of the economy's nominal growth rate. The moderation is attributable to a decline in the rate of growth of business credit which, after a period of quite rapid growth in the second half of 1997 and some strength in the middle of this year, has slowed to a rate of 7 per cent over the past three months. Lending for housing strengthened over the first half of the year, but has shown some signs of easing off in August and September. Personal credit continues to grow rapidly. ", " Over the course of 1998 growth rates in the broader deposit-based monetary aggregates, M3 and broad money, have increased significantly, bringing them more into line with credit growth. The stronger growth in M3 has been driven mainly by issues of certificates of deposit by banks. Broad money has increased less quickly than M3, reflecting little growth in deposits with non-bank financial intermediaries. Corresponding with the overall increase in deposit growth, financial intermediaries have been funding less of their credit expansion over the past six months through net raising of funds abroad. Currency growth, after initial signs of softening earlier in the year, has strengthened over the past couple of months, perhaps partly reflecting recent strength of spending by consumers. ", " Funds under management rose firmly in the June quarter, with growth remaining particularly strong in cash management and public unit trusts. While the bulk of assets of these funds is held in domestic equities, recent uncertainty in financial markets appears to have encouraged fund managers to increase their exposure to cash and deposits in the last two quarters. The strong inflows of funds to cash management trusts and negative valuation effects in equity funds also boosted overall exposure to cash. ", " The expansion of managed funds is part of a longer-term shift in the destination of savings, which has seen a decrease in the reliance on traditional low-interest savings vehicles and a substitution towards higher-yielding assets such as shares or managed funds. These changing consumer attitudes can be seen from the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Westpac-Melbourne</span> Institute Survey of Consumer Sentiment, which traces the long-term decline in consumers' preferences for deposits, and their increasing attraction towards equity investments (Graph 28). This change in households' perceptions has been particularly marked over the past five years. ", " The strong growth in personal credit over the past year reflects the favourable borrowing conditions which have helped to support household spending. There has been rapid growth in revolving credit in the form of overdrafts and credit-card lending. Banks have continued to encourage these forms of borrowing through the promotion of overdraft products, particularly those secured by residential property, and the use of reward programs associated with credit cards. Over the past year the number and value of credit-card transactions has increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span>, far outstripping the growth in consumer spending. To some extent this trend reflects a change in consumers' means of payment rather than a change in their net financial position. Nonetheless, credit-card debt outstanding to banks has increased by around 20 per cent over the past year. Motor vehicle finance has also expanded rapidly, in line with the growth in demand for cars. In aggregate, households appear to have remained sufficiently comfortable with their financial circumstances to take advantage of the current favourable borrowing conditions, with the result that household spending over the past year has increased more quickly than incomes. ", " Total household borrowing, comprising borrowing for housing and for other personal purposes, increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> over the year to September, considerably faster than the growth of household incomes. This has resulted in a continued upward trend in the ratio of household debt to disposable income (Graph 29). However, there has not been a commensurate increase in household interest payments, which have remained relatively stable as a share of household income since early last year. This in turn suggests that average interest rates paid have tended to fall, reflecting reduced rates on some personal loans and on fixed-rate home loans. Mortgage managers may also have contributed to lower average interest payments. The debt-servicing burden of households remains well below recent peaks. ", " Consistent with the pattern in business credit, funding from other sources showed strength around the middle of the year but appears to have eased recently. According to the quarterly financial accounts, the corporate sector raised $10.7 billion in new equity in the June quarter and $12.8 billion of debt, after quite small raisings in the March quarter. Indications for the September quarter are that financial market conditions were less conducive to corporate debt and equity raisings from the market. Reflecting good profit growth in the recent period, internal funding from retained earnings is at a high level. In the June quarter, the level of retained earnings was equivalent to 8½ per cent of GDP, compared with a decade average of 8 per cent, and accounted for around a third of total corporate funding. ", " High average levels of equity raisings over the past two years have seen the corporate debt to equity ratio in the non-financial sector levelling out at fairly moderate levels (Graph 30). The combination of moderate gearing ratios and low interest rates means that the corporate sector's interest burden remains well below its historical average. ", " Inflation remains low, but with signs of a gradual pick-up. The Treasury underlying CPI increased by 0.4 per cent in the September quarter, the same as in the previous quarter, to leave the annual rate at 1.6 per cent, up slightly from the low point reached last December. Other estimates of core or underlying inflation confirm a slight pick-up in inflation from the recent trough, but all show an inflation rate of less than 2 per cent over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Table 12, Graph 31)</span>. ", " Private-sector goods prices have been more subdued than services prices over the past year, increasing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.2 per cent</span>. Prices of imported goods included in the CPI, as discussed below, have continued to decline, although there have been strong increases recorded in import prices at the wholesale level. At the same time, domestically produced goods have recorded only small increases. The absence of strong price pressures for domestically produced goods suggests that the business environment faced by producers remains competitive, and may also reflect rapid productivity growth in the recent period which has helped to hold down growth in unit labour costs. Private-sector service price increases, after running at a rate of over 3 per cent for some time, eased in the September quarter to show an increase of 2.4 per cent over the year (Graph 32). ", " The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.2 per cent in the September quarter, and by 1.3 per cent over the year. The quarterly increase was held down slightly by declines in petrol prices and by reduced gas and electricity costs associated with the Victorian Winter Power Bonus and Energy Concession Scheme. ", " This is the first quarter of data for the 13th series CPI which, as discussed in detail in <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>, contains some important changes in the method of calculation. For monetary policy purposes, the most important of these changes is the adoption of an ‘acquisitions’ approach to the measurement of housing costs and other items purchased on credit. In practical terms this means that mortgage interest charges and consumer credit charges are now excluded from the index, while the purchase price of new houses (excluding land) is included. Since the CPI is not revised, the historical series remains under the previous basis up to the June quarter 1998. As a result, the change in the CPI over the year to September 1998 is still affected by interest rate reductions that were being passed on to borrowers in the December quarter last year. The Bank's estimate of a consistent acquisitions-CPI, which excludes this effect, shows an increase over the year of 1.8 per cent. This has picked up from a rate of 1.4 per cent over the year to the June quarter (Graph 31). ", " The decline in the exchange rate over the past year or more has important implications for the outlook for inflation. The effect of these movements occur in two phases. The first, in which wholesale prices of imports respond to the lower exchange rate, typically occurs quite rapidly, over the space of six months or so. The second stage, involving the pass-through of higher prices across the docks to consumers, typically takes much longer. ", " In evaluating the first stage of this process, the situation is complicated to some extent by the divergent movements in the Australian dollar against major currencies compared with its movement against Asian currencies. Since the middle of 1997, the exchange rate has declined by around 17 per cent against the currencies of the major industrial countries, and by 7 per cent overall in ‘import weighted’ terms (Table 13), reflecting the share of Asian countries in the sources of Australian imports. Movements in wholesale import prices recorded in the recent period appear to have been larger than would be explained by movements in the import-weighted exchange rate; over the past year, import prices at the docks, as measured by the import price index, have increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span>, and they are 14 per cent higher than at their trough in the June quarter 1997 (Table 13, Graph 33), with some further rise likely. This appears to reflect the disproportionate influence of the major industrial countries on world prices of the goods that Australia imports. The rise in import prices also suggests that this first stage of pass-through of the currency depreciation has, as is typical, occurred quite quickly. ", " The increases in import prices at the docks have yet to flow through, however, to prices paid by consumers. In the September quarter, the imported component of the CPI continued to decline, to be down by 1.7 per cent over the past year. While much of the decline in the September quarter was accounted for by motor vehicles, prices of other imported goods have also continued to fall slightly. While this second stage of adjustment is usually quite protracted, historical experience suggests that it would normally have begun by now. ", " The absence of any such pass-through a year after the initial declines in the exchange rate may be indicative of factors other than the usual response lags. In particular it is possible that competitive pressures in product markets are making it more difficult than usual for retailers to pass on the cost increases induced by exchange rate depreciation. It is certainly the case, for example, that competitive pressures remain intense in the car industry. The question remains whether this represents a temporary delay in pass-through, of a quarter or two, or whether a more persistent effect is to be expected. ", " While manufacturers' costs for imported inputs have been increasing quite rapidly, indicators of domestic producer prices continue to indicate an absence of significant inflation pressures. Reflecting the currency depreciation, and rises in import prices at the docks generally, costs of imported inputs for the manufacturing sector increased by 6 per cent over the year to September (Table 14). This has been largely offset, however, by declining prices of domestically sourced inputs, particularly primary products. Manufacturers' output prices have remained subdued, rising by only 1.5 per cent over the year. Building-materials price increases have also remained quite modest and continue to run at annual rates of less than 2 per cent. ", " Average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) increased by 1.7 per cent in the three months to August, following an increase in the previous three months of 0.6 per cent. The series continues to exhibit considerable volatility from quarter to quarter, but it would appear that recent trend growth is around 4 per cent; the increase over the latest year was 4.1 per cent, much the same annual rate of increase as has been recorded for the past couple of years. A possible factor contributing to the latest quarterly increase may be a tendency for pay rises to be more heavily concentrated around the end of the financial year, something that would not yet be fully reflected in seasonal adjustment factors. It is also possible that pay rises associated with the April safety net adjustment pushed up the overall increase in the quarter. ", " Wage increases specified under new enterprise agreements have remained well below the levels seen a <span class=\"no-wrap\">year ago (Graph 34)</span>. In the June quarter (the latest available data) new enterprise agreements yielded average increases of 3.8 per cent, about the same as in the previous quarter but a percentage point lower than in the June quarter 1997. In the private sector, these are currently running at 4.0 per cent. Preliminary indications are that bargaining outcomes have remained at around this level in the September quarter. There continue to be some large settlements in the construction industry, reflecting the strength of labour demand in that area, while there have been relatively modest bargaining outcomes in retail and other service industries. ", " Other indicators of wage costs suggest that wage pressures have eased over the past year (Table 15). The ABS wage cost index increased by 0.4 per cent in the June quarter, and at an annual rate of just under 3 per cent over the three quarters for which data are available. While it is still too early to assess the reliability of this indicator, the data available so far support the impression that the AWOTE measure may have been overstating the overall rate of wage increases. The NAB survey, which reports estimates by businesses of their average increase in labour costs, points to a gradual slowing of wage increases over the past year. Inflation in executive pay may also have moderated, according to the Cullen Egan Dell survey. Executive salaries, which had consistently grown at an annual rate around 6 per cent for several years, increased by 5 per cent over the four quarters to September. ", " The ACTU has announced a new minimum wage claim which is likely to be considered early next year. Increases in minimum wages in the past two years do not appear to have had a large impact on aggregate wage growth but have seen some sizeable increases in real wages of the low-paid. As such, their main economic impact is likely to be on employment of low-skilled workers rather than on aggregate wages and inflation. The current claim is for an increase in the minimum wage of $26.60 a week, to $400, amounting to an increase of 7 per cent for those at the minimum; the $26.60 increase would apply to all minimum award rates of pay up to $527.80 per week, from where a 5 per cent increase would apply. This compares with last year's claim for a $20 increase, which eventually led to increases of between $10 and $14 being awarded. ", " Although inflation has remained subdued during 1998, the prospect of higher retail prices flowing from the exchange rate depreciation has raised consumers' expectations for inflation in the near-term. The Melbourne Institute's survey of consumers' inflation expectations, while very volatile in recent months, shows a clear rise in expectations from historical lows late last year (Graph 35). In October, consumers expected prices to rise by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.7 per cent</span> during the year ahead, although it is a feature of this survey that expectations are consistently higher than actual inflation. The greater volatility of the survey results in recent months may reflect uncertainty generated by the sharp movements in the exchange rate. ", " A survey of trade union officials conducted by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT) after the release of the September quarter CPI, obtained a median forecast of 2.0 per cent inflation over the year to June 1999 and 2.4 per cent over the year to June 2000 (Table 16). This latter projection is significantly lower than in the previous survey taken three months earlier. A similar picture emerged from the Bank's survey of financial market economists, also taken after the CPI release, which gave a median inflation forecast of 2.2 per cent over the year to June 1999 and 2.4 per cent over the year to June 2000. These forecasts, especially for the coming year, are noticeably lower than in the previous survey. ", " Surveys of the selling price expectations of firms offer no clear consensus on the near-term outlook for inflation. Respondents to the NAB survey of non-farm businesses expect to raise prices by 0.4 per cent in the December quarter, similar to their expectations in recent quarters. The same is true when the retail sector is considered separately. In contrast, the ABS survey shows retail firms expecting to raise prices in December by 0.8 per cent, the highest quarterly rate of increase in three years. Surveys of manufacturers, such as ACCI-Westpac, generally imply a continuance of very moderate price growth. ", " While higher import prices may temporarily raise inflation, it is expectations about the medium-term that are likely to be the more important influence on price and wage-setting. In this regard, the NAB survey continues to show an increasing number of businesses – now nearly 40 per cent – who expect inflation to average less than <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> over the medium-term. The longer-term expectations of financial market participants, as implied by the price of indexed bonds, have remained close to 2 per cent during 1998. ", " The exchange rate depreciation since mid 1997 has not yet flowed through into higher consumer prices, but can be expected to have an impact over the next year. Inflation over that period therefore will hinge on the net effect of subdued domestic inflationary pressures and the import price pass-through. ", " On the basis of historical relationships, and given current exchange rates and rates of wages growth, the rise in wholesale import prices already in evidence would be expected to lift the overall CPI inflation rate to a peak of around 3 per cent during 1999, following which a gradual decline could be anticipated. ", " Recent data suggest the possibility that the run-up in inflation might be somewhat less than that if unusually competitive conditions were to continue to put a dampener on pass-through at the consumer level as they appear to have done so far. Were the world economic situation to continue to weaken, it is also conceivable that competitive pressures in international markets might contain import prices at their source, though it is hard to find concrete evidence of this in published data at present. If the import price pass-through is simply slower, of course, the short-term peak in inflation would be lower, but also more prolonged. ", " Beyond the next year, price trends are more likely to be driven by domestic factors. Were inflation expectations to pick up noticeably as a result of the temporary rise in inflation, and be reflected in price and wage decisions, currently low levels of domestic inflation would pick up, sustaining overall inflation at higher rates once the exchange rate effects have been completed. The risk of that outcome appears to be low at present, even though inflation expectations have moved up in some cases. Another risk on the up-side for inflation is the possibility that the exchange rate might again weaken, though as always the impact of this would depend on what other forces were associated with the exchange rate movement. ", " Overall, the Bank's current assessment is that inflation – in both CPI and underlying terms – will be consistent with the target of 2–3 per cent over the foreseeable future. ", "  Falls in bank share prices. In broad terms, prices of bank shares in the US and Europe halved between mid July and early October (Graph 2). This was an important factor dragging down share prices more generally, with the overall US share market losing 20 per cent and European markets falling by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span>. The calming influence of the US monetary easings (see below) has seen about two-thirds of these losses subsequently reversed.   <!-- Graph Start --> <div class=\"image-graph\" id=\"graph2\"> <figure> <figcaption><div class=\"title\">Graph 2</div></figcaption> <img src=\"images/graph-1198-1-02.gif\" alt=\"Graph 2: Banking Share Price Indices\"> </figure> </div> <!-- Graph End -->  ", "  A flight into government bonds issued by highly rated countries.

", " From early 1997 until recently, there had been a widespread tendency among industrial countries, albeit a gradual one in some cases, towards higher policy interest rates. In some countries, this was aimed at restraining incipient inflationary pressures arising from strong demand, and in others it reflected attempts to limit falls in exchange rates.

Amid signs that inflationary and wage pressures might have been stronger than earlier thought, the Bank of England made a further tightening of 0.25 percentage points in <span class=\"no-wrap\">June 1998</span>. ", " While most of the increases described above reflected concerns about emerging inflationary pressures as economic activity picked up, the increases in New Zealand interest rates which began in the middle of 1997 were associated with a fall in the exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar. Like the Australian dollar, the New Zealand currency came under downward pressure from the middle of 1997 following the outbreak of the Asian crisis, and the increases in interest rates acted as a counterweight to prevent too rapid a fall in the Monetary Conditions Index – the exchange and interest rate composite used to guide monetary policy in New Zealand. Between mid 1997 and mid 1998, short-term interest rates in New Zealand rose from around 7 per cent to about 9 per cent. ", " The four countries which raised interest rates in 1997 and into 1998 have all reduced them recently. In New Zealand, where interest rates began to fall in late June 1998 as signs became clearer that the economy was in recession, short-term interest rates have since fallen to around 3.5 per cent. The US eased in late September and again in mid October, on each occasion by 0.25 percentage points, reducing the Fed funds rate to 5.0 per cent. These easings were in response to turmoil in US financial markets. Canada quickly followed the US on each occasion, effectively reversing half the August rise in rates. The UK eased in both early October and early November, by 0.25 percentage points and 0.50 percentage points respectively, to 6.75 per cent. ", " The decision by 11 European countries to adopt the Euro as the single currency at the start of 1999 means that their policy interest rates need to converge by that time. At the start of 1996, short-term rates in the 11 countries ranged from 3.40 per cent to 9.0 per cent. Through 1996, interest rates in all 11 countries <span class=\"no-wrap\">fell (admittedly by different amounts)</span> as, like the English-speaking countries, they responded to softer economic activity (see middle panel of Graph). In 1997, however, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Ireland and Austria raised interest rates as economic activity in these countries picked up and inflationary pressures increased. More recently, those at the high end of the range have implemented cuts so that rates now range from 3.20 per cent to 5.75 per cent. ", " Through the first half of 1998, the expectation was that short-term rates in these countries would eventually converge at the weighted average – 3.75 per cent. But with inflationary pressures turning out to be less intense than earlier thought, expectations in recent months have swung to favour convergence towards the bottom end of the range. ", " The path of official interest rates in the Scandinavian countries is shown in the bottom panel in the Graph. Like other industrial countries, they too eased through 1996 and then began to tighten in the second half of 1997. Sweden reversed its tightening in June 1998 – cutting rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.25 percentage points</span> to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.10 per cent</span> – as inflationary pressures turned out to be less than earlier expected. It eased further in early November, to 3.85 per cent. ", " Norway and Denmark, on the other hand, raised interest rates substantially further in 1998, mainly in response to exchange rate pressures. In the case of Norway, rates were raised from <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.50 per cent</span> to <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span>, while in Denmark they rose from 3.75 per cent to 5.75 per cent. Since then, Denmark reversed some of this, cutting rates in three steps to 4.40 per cent, but Norway has left rates unchanged. ", " One of the revelations that emerged from the recent market turmoil was that the positions being carried by hedge funds, and the extent to which banks had funded them, were much bigger than most observers had appreciated. These firms were able to run large positions relative to their capital bases because markets have evolved ways of funding positions which are very economical in terms of capital requirements. This box outlines typical ways in which market participants can leverage themselves in financial markets. ", " In securities markets, positions are usually funded through repurchase agreements, or repos. These are a form of collaterised loan, on which the lender takes a margin or ‘haircut’ to protect itself against adverse movements in the price of the securities used as collateral. In government securities markets in most industrial countries, haircuts usually run at 2 per cent of the value of the loan, though they can vary with the maturity of the security. Thus, a hedge fund that had $2 billion in capital could, through repos, borrow enough to fund a holding of $100 billion of securities by applying the capital to haircuts – i.e. it could gear up 50 times. ", " The haircuts involved on repos in emerging market securities are larger than those on Treasury securities but still allow substantial gearing. Because these markets had performed well over a run of years, and their price volatility had declined, haircuts had been below levels which could absorb recent falls in values. Lenders reacted by calling in increased margins, and the de-leveraging that followed proved very disruptive to market conditions as positions were forcibly and quickly cut. ", " Gearing can also be generated through derivatives markets since purchases or sales of derivative contracts do not require immediate payment of the full face value of the contracts; rather, only a margin needs to be paid. As initial margins are typically less than 2 per cent for bond contracts and less than 6 per cent for equity contracts, investors can take on exposure to market positions that are many multiples of their capital. With options, the extent of gearing that can be attained depends on the premia that investors need to pay, which vary with market conditions and the characteristics of the options. In most cases, however, the premium is only a small percentage of the face value of the option, so very high gearing can be attained. ", " In foreign exchange markets, the ability to acquire positions without having to commit capital is relatively unconstrained. This is because most deals tend to involve the exchange of one currency for another, rather than the exchange of cash for securities, and therefore haircuts are not taken. ", " There are two key elements involved in taking a speculative currency position: first acquiring the position; and second arranging the funding. Taking recent events in Australia as an example: hedge funds sold Australian dollars in June to establish short positions in order to profit from the expected fall in the currency. This was done by arranging deals with a bank to sell Australian dollars in exchange for US dollars for normal ‘spot’ settlement (i.e. within two business days). Because the hedge funds were establishing short positions, in the sense that they did not own a corresponding amount of Australian assets to start with, they needed to generate Australian dollars within two days to meet the deliveries to which they had committed. ", " The typical way in which such a short position would be covered is by entering into a foreign currency swap transaction. Under the first leg of the swap, which is timed to coincide with the settlement date of the spot transaction, the hedge fund would buy Australian dollars and sell US dollars – i.e. the reverse of the spot transaction – so as to effectively cancel out the flows of funds, as shown below. In the second leg of the swap, the hedge fund would provide Australian dollars and receive US dollars on an agreed future date. ", " Through these transactions, a hedge fund is able to take a position in the currency market without needing to supply either Australian dollars or US dollars until some point in the future. Effectively, all it has is a forward commitment, which requires neither capital nor any immediate funding. ", " The cost of the swap to the hedge fund is the difference between Australian and US interest rates for the period of the swap. This is built into the exchange rates agreed for the second leg of the swap, so again there are no up-front payments. ", " Swaps can be undertaken for any term, but are mainly for short periods – out to one week. If the exchange rate has fallen before the maturity of the swap, the short-seller can buy Australian dollars in the spot market at a profit to deliver into swap commitments. If not, the position can be rolled forward for a further period (or, of course, closed out at a loss). ", " The only constraint on the size of the positions hedge funds can undertake through these transactions is the willingness of banks to provide forward foreign exchange facilities. This depends on the banks' assessment of the risks involved and on the amount of capital they need to allocate to support the facility in accord with prudential requirements. Banks only undertake the transactions with the counterparties for which they have established credit limits, which restricts the types of counterparties which can access large positions in this way. But hedge funds, with a history of high returns and a substantial market reputation had no trouble gaining access to large credit limits from banks, particularly as they generated so much income for banks through their trading activities. In fact, so strong was the standing of hedge funds that they often insisted that banks which wanted to deal with them also provide funding. ", " From the banks' side, there are constraints in the form of capital requirements imposed under the Basle capital adequacy rules. These, however, apply only to swap contracts for settlement in more than 14 days, and even these are very small. For example, the capital requirement on swaps with maturities between <span class=\"no-wrap\">14 days</span> and one year amount to only 0.04 per cent of the value of the contract. In other words, a $A100 forward facility provided to a (non-bank) investor requires the bank to set aside 4 cents of capital. ", " There has been much discussion of the effect of the Asian economic slump on the Australian economy. To date, the main direct impact has been seen in reduced exports to east Asia. Less easily quantifiable is the potential impact on Australia of the broader world slowdown now expected by official forecasters. This box provides a perspective on the economic downturn, by outlining channels through which the Australian economy is being affected, and comparing the overall external slowdown with previous episodes. ", " Exports to Asia fell towards the end of 1997 and in the first few months of 1998. By mid 1998, exports to the initial crisis economies – Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines – were one third or more below the level where they might have been had trend growth of the previous five years continued. In addition, exports have declined to other Asian countries which were not immediately part of the crisis, but which were subsequently affected, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, China and Taiwan. ", " The decline in sales to Asia has been partly offset by increased sales elsewhere, including the United States and Europe. The diversion of exports was particularly pronounced for resources, where growth in volumes over the past year has not slowed at all, and has been higher than the average for the 1990s. Exports of manufactures and services have been hit, with the result that total non-rural exports (excluding gold) have declined over the past year. ", " The loss of sales to Asia accounts for only part of the loss to Australians from the deterioration in international trading conditions. In foreign currency terms, lower prices are being achieved for the bulk of Australia's exports to all destinations. This amounts to a fall in Australia's terms of trade – that is, the purchasing power of Australia's exports in terms of imports has declined. Between mid 1997 and the September quarter of 1998, the terms of trade is estimated to have fallen by about 4 per cent. This lowers the purchasing power of national income. ", " The absolute fall in commodity prices has been more than offset by the decline in the exchange rate, so that in Australian dollar terms export prices have in fact risen. In other words, the income loss which arises from a decline in the terms of trade has been passed on to users of imports. ", " There are also potential indirect effects of the external changes. Lower income growth, occasioned by lost exports and lower terms of trade, can be expected to result in lower growth in aggregate demand, and therefore some further reduction in growth in domestic output compared with what otherwise would have occurred. It is likely these forces are beginning to affect the economy now. There is also the possibility of confidence effects, should business or households abruptly curtail their spending plans independently of current income. So far, these effects appear to have been quite minor, though confidence could remain vulnerable to further deterioration in external conditions. Working in the other direction, the increase in the relative price of imports should induce substitution away from imports and towards domestic <span class=\"no-wrap\">import-competing</span> goods and services, adding to domestic output. ", " Graph C1 and Table C1 compare this episode with previous downturns in world economic growth over the past two decades, using a number of different benchmarks. The current downturn in world economic growth, as estimated by the IMF, is of comparable size to that in the early 1990s but is somewhat less than that in the early 1980s or mid 1970s. This estimate reflects the weakness in east Asia and Japan as well as an assumed moderate decline in growth in the United States. The decline in growth in Australia's particular group of trading partners is much more substantial than anything seen in the past two decades. However, the resilience of the economy to date suggests that it is global growth, rather than growth in trading partners, which is of most importance. Both the decline in the terms of trade and the fall in commodity prices to date are less than those of the previous three episodes, noticeably so for the terms of trade. Exports have declined in volume terms by a little more over the past year than in the two preceding episodes, though the fall in the early 1980s was much larger. ", " Since 1993, the conduct of monetary policy in Australia has been based on an inflation target. The <a href=\"/monetary-policy/framework/stmt-conduct-mp-1-14081996.html\"><em>Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy</em></a>, issued by the Treasurer and the Governor in 1996, formalised the target as ‘keeping underlying inflation between 2 and 3 per cent, on average, over the cycle’. Although no specific measure of underlying inflation was referred to in this statement, it has been customary to evaluate monetary policy in terms of the so-called ‘Treasury underlying’ rate. Other measures of underlying or core inflation can be calculated, but on any measure, it is clear that the inflation target has been achieved in the 1990s (Table D1). ", " The concept of underlying inflation has been used to avoid the distortions associated with the most common measure of inflation – the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The main difficulty with using the CPI to evaluate monetary policy has been the inclusion, since 1986, of mortgage interest charges as a measure of the cost of owner-occupied housing. Ideally, for monetary policy purposes, a consumer price index should measure changes in the price of consumer goods and services and not the price of assets or the costs associated with financing their acquisition. Moreover, the inclusion of interest rates meant that the CPI would move perversely following a change in the monetary policy instrument: a rise in interest rates aimed at reducing medium-term inflation pressures would push the measured CPI <em>up</em> in the short term. ", " Recently, the Australian Bureau of Statistics implemented changes to the calculation of the CPI which will significantly reduce the problems in using the published CPI to evaluate monetary policy. Beginning with the September quarter release, the CPI is now being constructed using an ‘acquisitions’ approach to measuring prices, rather than the ‘outlays’ approach used previously. As a consequence, the cost of housing services for owner occupiers will now be measured by the cost of acquiring a new dwelling (excluding land) rather than the outlays involved in servicing the mortgage which financed the purchase. ", " The behaviour of the new CPI is not known with certainty, but a reasonable guide from recent history can be obtained by substituting an index of prices of new dwellings for interest charges in the existing CPI. This is the series labelled ‘acquisitions’ CPI in Graph D1. This shows that the ‘acquisitions’ measure is much less volatile than the CPI, demonstrating that much of the observed volatility in the CPI was induced by the inclusion of interest rates. ", " Since 1990, the average rates of inflation as measured by these series were each between <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 and 3 per cent</span> (Table D1). Over this particular period, the ‘acquisitions’ CPI recorded a slightly higher rate of inflation, on average, than the underlying series – by a few tenths of a percentage point per year. This is because prices for certain items excluded from the underlying series (in particular, tobacco and health) have recorded higher rates of increase than the average over the period. Overall, however, the trends are not markedly different and it seems unlikely that the conduct of monetary policy would have been different had the target been specified in terms of an acquisitions-based CPI rather than underlying inflation. ", " On the assumption that the ‘acquisitions’ CPI above is a reasonable guide to the behaviour of the new CPI, and given the wider community recognition of the CPI, the Bank's judgment is that the inflation target – maintaining inflation of 2–3 per cent on average over time – can now be understood as referring to the published CPI. The CPI will still be affected from time to time by temporary factors which do not signify persistent trends in inflation, but given the average nature of the target such fluctuations should not make for too many problems for policy. Of course, the Bank will continue to analyse underlying inflation measures, as these can be informative about the influence of such temporary factors on the CPI. ", " The Treasurer has agreed that this approach is consistent with the intent of the <a href=\"/monetary-policy/framework/stmt-conduct-mp-1-14081996.html\"><em>Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy</em></a> of August 1996.

The expansion, now nearly through its eighth year, is the longest since the 1960s. Growth last year again exceeded 4 per cent, which is above the trend experienced during the previous 20 years, at a time when the global growth environment has been anything but strong. The resulting moderate growth in employment has seen a further gradual decline in the rate of unemployment, which over recent months has been at its lowest for nearly a decade. ", " This outcome has been better than either the Bank or other forecasters had foreseen. The impact of the Asian crisis, and the associated global economic slowdown, had been expected to lead to some decline in Australia's overall growth rate, despite the evident strength in private domestic expenditure underpinning aggregate demand. As it has turned out, overall growth has declined by a good deal less than those forecasts envisaged, and the risks of a sharp decline in the near future have lessened. ", " At the same time, inflation has picked up slightly, but more slowly than the Bank's forecast a year ago. Over the year to March, inflation in underlying terms was 1¾ per cent. A key reason for the very low results recently has been that few tangible effects have so far emerged of the depreciation of the exchange rate which occurred between mid 1997 and the end of 1998. This is an experience shared by some other countries whose currencies have declined, in a world environment of generally very low inflation and highly competitive pricing. Domestic pressures for higher prices generally remain reasonably subdued as well. The Bank expects inflation in underlying terms to be about 2 per cent during 1999, the same as its forecast in February, and a continuation of Australia's excellent inflation performance during the 1990s. CPI inflation will remain below that over the coming year, as a result of the recent changes to health insurance arrangements. ", " This combination of strong growth and exceptionally low inflation is quite unlike the experience of the preceding thirty years. That such a performance has been maintained, almost two years after the Asian crisis first broke in Thailand, is indicative of the extent to which the Australian economy's underlying strength and resilience have been improved over time. These changes have included better arrangements for macroeconomic management, but also extensive improvements in the economy's structural features. Some importance must also be attached to the way in which the international economy has changed over recent years, particularly the increasingly competitive environment in a number of important global industries. Nonetheless, as yet we have only an incomplete understanding of these phenomena, and particularly of the extent to which they make for a persistent change in the economy's growth potential, as opposed to a temporary one. ", " International economic conditions continue to disappoint. Growth remains elusive in Japan, and weakened in Europe late last year. Such growth as there is on a global basis remains heavily dependent on the continuing strength of the US economy. Commodity prices, despite some recent gains, remain low, and it is still a difficult environment for those Australian producers who earn their incomes through exports. The effect of this is clear in Australia's declining terms of trade, and a widening in the current account deficit. ", " There are, however, some encouraging signs in Asia, where the contractions in economic activity in several of the initial crisis countries have ended, and where Korea in particular is recovering faster than expected. In addition, international financial markets have recovered from the sharp dislocations experienced in the second half of 1998, and have taken on a more positive tone, helped by significant easings of monetary policy in the major countries over the past six months. Share markets in many countries have reached new highs, debt markets are again accommodating substantial new issues by major corporations, and capital has begun to flow back into some emerging markets. The change in sentiment has affected currency markets as well, and the Australian dollar has risen. ", " The buoyancy in asset markets, together with a quite pronounced lift in measures of business and household confidence, is a noticeable feature also of the Australian scene. It is widely thought that factors such as the gains made by investors in privatisations and demutualisations helped to sustain household confidence and spending in 1998. But general asset market gains have continued since then. In the five months since the Bank eased monetary policy in December, the Australian share market has risen by over 10 per cent. Housing prices in the two largest cities are rising at a rate well in excess of the general rate of inflation. ", " In light of the weak world economy and the current subdued state of investment intentions in Australia, it is still reasonable to expect somewhat lower GDP growth during 1999 than the very strong growth recorded in the two preceding years. The risks of a larger decline in growth have diminished, however, since late last year. Indeed, the current buoyancy of asset markets, and business and household confidence, point to the possibility that this forecast, like earlier ones, could turn out to be too pessimistic. This shift in the balance of risks on the growth outlook, and the inflation forecast suggesting outcomes consistent with the target over the coming year, have been the key elements in the Bank maintaining an unchanged stance of policy over recent months. ", " The past six months have seen a remarkable recovery in world financial markets from the events that followed the default by Russia last August. Concerns about a worldwide credit crunch and deflation have been replaced by a surge in credit, greater optimism about the world economic outlook, and new records in many share markets. An important part of this transformation has been easings of monetary policy by central banks in all developed countries, led by the US Federal Reserve. ", " The Federal Reserve reduced the Fed funds rate from 5.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent in three steps in September, October and November, largely to prevent a credit crunch from developing. Interest rates in the euro area were reduced by member central banks to 3 per cent in December 1998, and again by 0.5 per cent in April, as evidence of continued sluggishness in growth in the core of the euro area accumulated. Japan cut its target call rate from 0.25 per cent to 0.15 per cent in February and subsequently guided overnight interbank interest rates to (fractionally above) zero. Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Norway have also cut their benchmark interest rates; in the last four cases, reversing or partially reversing rises earlier in 1998. ", " The Fed's action ensured that the financial market fragility in the United States and in most other developed countries that became evident in the September quarter last year did not persist for long. Conditions in some emerging countries took longer to settle, particularly in Latin America where concerns about credit risk were particularly highlighted by the Russian default because of their chequered financial past. Credit spreads remained very wide and eventually took their toll on Brazil, where persistent capital flight caused the authorities to devalue, and then float, the exchange rate in January. While this caused some hiccups in other emerging markets, the flow-on effects were relatively mild, helped by the easier monetary policy stance in developed countries and the fact that, by then, the economies in some of the Asian countries had already showed signs of stabilising. ", " In developed countries, the recovery in financial markets over the past six months or so is most obvious in the sharp rally in US share prices. The Dow Jones index has risen by over 40 per cent since its trough last year, breaking 10,000 in late March and reaching a new high above 11,000 in early May (Graph 1). Other indices – which are either more broadly representative (like the S&amp;P 500), have a higher technology weight (like NASDAQ), or have a higher small-firm weight (like the Russell 2000) – also show that share prices have risen strongly since the trough last year (Graph 1). Many commentators now regard at least some parts of the US share market as being in a financial ‘bubble’, leading to concerns that a share market correction could have a substantial negative impact on US economic growth and, consequently, the world economic outlook. ", " Share prices in other countries also rose, mainly in response to US developments but domestic factors also played a role (Graph 2). In Europe, increases over the past six months have been similar to those in the US, although share prices in Germany have not recovered to their mid 1998 peak. In Japan, share prices are about 30 per cent higher than six months ago, with most of the rise taking place in the past month or two, as markets have anticipated the start of a recovery in the Japanese economy. Bank stocks have rallied by over 65 per cent since plans to inject public funds of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.5 trillion yen (US$63 billion)</span> and private funds of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 trillion yen (US$17 billion)</span> into banks' capital were announced last October. ", " In bond markets, yields have generally risen after monetary policy was eased, a sign that those easings were successful in dispelling concerns about deflation (Graph 3). Over the past half year, US bond yields have risen in net terms by over 100 basis points, to 5.3 per cent. They were higher at one point but the outbreak of the Balkan war caused some ‘safe-haven’ buying of US securities. European bond yields have risen only marginally from their January lows; falls in inflation to below 1 per cent and sluggish economic activity have limited the rise. In Japan, bond yields rose more than elsewhere in late 1998, even though the Japanese economy remains the weakest among industrial countries. The reason for the sharp rise was perceptions about supply pressures in the Japanese government bond market following the announcement that the Trust Fund Bureau – a public body – would be curtailing previously large purchases of bonds in the market. Yields rose from a historical low of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.7 per cent</span> in early October to over 2.5 per cent in January. This rise in government long-term interest rates – a benchmark against which many private loans are priced – raised fears that it might stifle the provision of credit in the economy, and various steps were taken to massage the yields down again, including the resumption of purchases by the Trust Fund Bureau. These measures have seen bond yields fall back to around 1.4 per cent. ", " Foreign exchange markets in recent months have reflected the much stronger cyclical position of the US economy <span lang=\"fr\">vis-à-vis</span> Europe and Japan. The US dollar has strengthened by 11 per cent against the euro since the latter was introduced on 1 January, and by 6 per cent against the yen, at around the 120 yen level. ", " All in all, the major currency markets have been less volatile lately – a development which may reflect the reduced position-taking by hedge funds following the losses they suffered in late 1998 and the subsequent tightening of credit standards by the banks that had been funding them. This may, however, prove to be only a temporary respite. While data only cover a proportion of the industry and are not subject to due diligence, market reports indicate that investment flows into hedge funds have resumed in February after three months of substantial outflows. Moreover, there are reports that traditional investors such as pension/superannuation funds and US university endowments are shifting a portion of their investments into hedge funds as a form of diversification. ", " The so-called ‘emerging’ markets, which had been shunned by investors during 1998, have recovered even more strongly than developed markets over the past six months. In November, the IMF announced a US$41.5 billion restructuring package for Brazil. Compared to previous IMF programs, the package was not only better directed to the problem at hand – fiscal policy – but was also more pro-active and front-loaded. It did not, however, dispel market doubts about the ability of the Brazilian Government to meet the conditions and, as noted, the authorities were ultimately forced to devalue. But the crisis passed quickly and, more importantly, showed few signs of spreading to other emerging markets. ", " Exchange rates in Asia showed little impact from the Brazilian devaluation and, more recently, have risen. Some of these countries have used the improved sentiment and the foreign exchange inflows associated with current account surpluses as an opportunity to boost foreign exchange reserves and repay debt. Korea's usable foreign exchange reserves are now over US$50 billion, up from a trough of US$8 billion, and they have repaid <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$4.8 billion</span> of the US$28.6 billion disbursed under the IMF program. The impact of events in Brazil on other Latin American countries was more severe but, even there, there has been a noticeable recovery in financial markets in recent months. ", " The strengthening in exchange rates has allowed the authorities in all emerging markets to cut interest rates. Interest rates are now at below-crisis levels in east Asia, apart from Indonesia where interest rates still remain high (though off their peaks) <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 4)</span>. In Latin America, apart from Brazil, interest rates have generally returned to pre-crisis levels (Graph 5). ", " Lower interest rates have resulted in a more supportive climate for the financial restructuring that is underway in east Asia. Progress has been made in the initial crisis east Asian economies in closing or merging non-viable financial intermediaries and recapitalising banks; Korea and Malaysia in particular have shifted non-performing loans off bank balance sheets to asset management vehicles (<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). ", " Share prices in most Asian and Latin American countries have risen sharply in recent months as foreign investors, sensing a turning point in these economies and fearing that they have missed the bottom of the market, have resumed substantial investment into these regions. In some countries, share markets have returned to mid 1997 levels. ", " Australian markets have been very much part of the world trends: monetary policy was eased, bond yields and share prices have risen. The exchange rate has also strengthened. ", " The easing in monetary policy took place on 2 December 1998, when the Bank announced a cut of 0.25 of a percentage point in the cash rate, to a new target of 4.75 per cent. This move brought the cut in the cash rate since July 1996 to 2.75 percentage points, and returned it to the same level as at its previous cyclical low of 1993/94. Short-term market interest rates had moved down to near the new cash rate target in anticipation of the policy announcement and subsequently remained near this level, consistent with the expectation that monetary policy would remain unchanged in the near term. The current level of the cash rate is similar to that in other English-speaking countries: rates in the US and Canada are also at 4.75 per cent, while in the UK and New Zealand they are at 5.25 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively. ", " In the bond market, yields had fallen sharply in late 1998 to 4.72 per cent, their lowest level since 1964, due largely to events in global markets at that time. As elsewhere, yields have subsequently risen as those global concerns diminished. The rise was helped by a run of continued strong data on the domestic economy, and 10-year bond yields reached about 5.75 per cent by early March. Yields declined for a time, but again moved higher following the news that domestic inflation, in underlying terms, was higher than markets had expected and US economic growth continues to surprise on the upside. By early May, the yield on 10-year bonds in Australia had returned to a level of 5.7 per cent, a net rise of 1 percentage point from the low point of mid December, but still low by historical standards. In the second half of the 1980s, the yield on 10-year bonds averaged 13.2 per cent, and even as recently as late 1994 they had been as high as 10.7 per cent. ", " Some of this fall in yields reflects overseas factors: the structure of long-term yields has fallen globally. But this does not explain all of the fall in the yield curve in Australia, as the spread between Australian and US bonds has narrowed from around 400–500 points in the early 1990s to around 20–40 points at present. Domestic factors have been important in this, the main one being the fall in inflation and the widespread confidence among investors that Australia will sustain low inflation. This is reflected in a narrowing of the gap between the nominal yield on conventional bonds and the real yield on indexed securities from about 5 percentage points in 1994 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 percentage points at present</span>. ", " Improvement in the budgetary position, which has already seen a contraction in the supply of bonds and improved perceptions of the country's credit standing, has also been a significant factor in the narrowing of the spread between yields in Australia and the US. ", " Share prices in Australia have increased by 26 per cent since their 1998 lows, less than the rise in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United States</span> market in the same period. In recent months, the <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> moved through a series of record highs, and is currently about 3,100. The gold sector aside, each of the major sectors of the share market has moved up. Initially, the recovery was in share prices of banks (which have increased by an average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent)</span> and industrial companies (up by 21 per cent). More recently, the rise has been in resource companies (excluding gold producers), the average share price of which has risen by 31 per cent over the past couple of months. This rise is a reflection of the brighter outlook for commodity prices, and the greater confidence in the world economy. ", " While confidence has generally been high in the equity market, the rise in share prices in Australia has been concentrated among larger companies. Since the trough in the <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> last October, an index of the share prices of the 20 most-highly capitalised companies in Australia has increased by more than 30 per cent, whereas for other companies the rise was about 18 per cent. Within the group of large companies, banks have been strongest. ", " After recovering during September and October 1998, as hedge funds were forced to cut their short positions, the Australian dollar has been relatively stable over the past six months. For most of this period it traded in a range from US61 to US65 cents, but rose to higher levels more recently (Graph 6). Movements within this range have reflected the ebb and flow of expectations about world growth and commodity prices, changing views on the strength of the Australian economy and the prospective stance of monetary policy. ", " The expectation and then the reality of the monetary easing in December (combined with weaker commodity prices) contributed to a decline in the currency through late November and early December. With markets anticipating for a time that there would be an additional easing in monetary policy early in 1999, the dollar fell further to a low of around US61 cents in late December. Subsequently, better-than-expected domestic economic data and a rally in commodity prices (spurred by continuing strong US growth) took the Australian dollar to around US65 cents in early February – a rise that was partially reversed by the end of February as some of the bullishness about commodity prices receded and the trade account deteriorated. ", " Through March and April the dollar settled in the US62 to US64 cent range, before moving higher again in April, to break US66 cents. This rise reflected a number of factors, but in most part was due to firmer commodity prices, particularly base metal prices. ", " In the light of the greater stability in the market and the higher average level of the exchange rate, the Bank in mid April resumed its normal practice of covering the Government's foreign exchange needs by purchasing foreign currencies in the market. In the period since mid 1997, the Bank had met these needs directly from its foreign currency reserves. ", " Growth of world GDP is estimated to have been about 2¼ per cent in 1998. Most forecasts for 1999 are generally for a similar outcome, with some pick-up forecast in 2000. Downside risks to those figures, which seemed considerable late in 1998, have lessened significantly in recent months, to the point where the IMF now characterises the risks to its own forecast as evenly balanced. As noted above, sentiment in financial markets has changed even more significantly, in anticipation of stronger global economic performance. ", " The United States continues to be the mainstay of world economic activity, with the US economy now experiencing its longest continuous expansion since the 1960s. Moreover, for much of the current expansion (particularly the past three years), growth has outstripped most estimates of potential, without as yet sparking inflationary pressures. ", " After very strong growth in 1998, most forecasters had been expecting some slowing early in 1999. On the whole, however, the economy has continued to expand rapidly, with first quarter growth estimated at <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.1 per cent</span>. Most of the strength in the March quarter was driven by consumption, which recorded its fifth successive quarter of growth over 1 per cent. The sustained strength in consumption reflects a combination of rising real wages and a historically high stock market, which together have resulted in record levels of consumer confidence and rising wealth. ", " The strong growth has not been distributed evenly across the whole economy. Weak external demand, combined with strong import penetration, has contributed to a decline in growth of manufacturing production to an annual rate of around 2¼ per cent, from 7 per cent at the end of 1997. Nevertheless, confidence in the manufacturing sector has recovered some ground over the past few months and sentiment about export orders, in particular, has picked up. ", " The economy has also benefited from the easing of the strains evident in US financial markets toward the end of last year. According to a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve, the proportion of banks tightening lending standards applied to businesses has fallen significantly. Spreads on corporate bonds over US Treasury bonds continue to decline towards their 10-year average, so that, while Treasury bond yields have increased by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage point</span> since their lows late last year, interest rates on most categories of corporate debt have risen by a much smaller amount. ", " A feature of the current expansion has been the relatively strong growth in productivity. Non-farm business sector productivity rose by 2¾ per cent over the past year, more than double the average rate of productivity growth since 1980. Strong productivity growth has allowed for higher output growth and the associated low unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent – the lowest rate in almost 30 years – without generating inflationary pressures. Indeed, ‘core’ consumer price inflation (which excludes energy and food costs) in March remained at its lowest rate this cycle, 2.1 per cent. This behaviour contrasts with past experiences of low unemployment. Also surprising is that wage pressures have abated over the past year. Although real wages are still growing, their rate of growth peaked in April last year, and has consistently fallen since (Graph 7). ", " Benefiting from the strong economy of its major trading partner, the Canadian economy grew by 2.8 per cent over the year to December. The unemployment rate has fallen to 7.8 per cent, its lowest level in more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">eight years</span>, but with inflation around 1 per cent, the Bank of Canada reduced the overnight target interest rate to 4.75 per cent at the end of March. This completed the unwinding of the 1 percentage point increase in interest rates the Bank of Canada undertook last year when the currency was under downward pressure. ", " In Latin America, Brazil has, to date, weathered its currency crisis more successfully than many expected. Economic activity across the region has fallen sharply since the onset of the crisis, reflecting the high levels of interest rates aimed at resisting capital outflows during late 1998 and early 1999. There are tentative signs, however, that output is stabilising. ", " Economic conditions over much of east Asia have improved in recent months (Graph 8). In most of the countries which first entered the financial crisis in 1997, activity has generally stabilised, aided by lower interest rates and, more recently, expansionary fiscal policies. However, despite the large exchange rate depreciations experienced by these countries, to date there has not been any sustained pick-up in export demand – export volumes in Thailand have at best been flat, and have fallen in Indonesia; export growth in Korea has continued, but at a declining pace over the past year, after the strong initial boost in the wake of the 1997 currency depreciation. ", " The absence of a general export-led recovery in the initial crisis economies partly reflects the inadequacy of global demand for their products, the United States being the only major export market with strong growth at present. Another factor is that there has been some tendency (as discussed below) for exporters in these countries to absorb part of the impact of exchange rate depreciations in higher domestic currency prices, probably reflecting a need to rebuild profitability. More generally, recovery is being impeded by the poor state of financial and corporate sectors. While a number of reforms have been carried out and repair of financial and corporate balance sheets will be a long and arduous process, financial intermediation is yet to resume in any significant sense. <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a> (above) discusses financial restructuring in detail. ", " Korea has seen a stronger economic recovery so far than the other initial crisis economies, and a stronger one than was generally anticipated. Real GDP reached a low point in the middle of 1998 and has since grown at an annualised rate of around 7 per cent (Table 1). While exports have made some contribution to growth in recent quarters, growth has been mainly driven by consumer spending. Spending by businesses on investment goods is weak, and may remain so for some time, given the prevalence of excess capacity in Korean industry. An increase in the pace of corporate restructuring may also have a negative impact on economic activity in the short term. ", " The other east Asian economies – China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore – have been adversely affected because of their interdependence with the initial crisis economies, both as trading partners and competitors. This has been exacerbated to varying degrees by stresses in their domestic financial systems. In the case of Hong Kong and Singapore – which experienced recessions during 1998 – falling asset prices have had quite pronounced effects on activity. In China, there has been a slowdown in consumption growth, in part reflecting concerns over unemployment due to job losses associated with the reform of state-owned enterprises. To counterbalance these contractionary forces, government spending programs have been increased and monetary policy loosened. ", " Activity has begun to recover in New Zealand. After contracting by 1.6 per cent in the first half of 1998, GDP increased by 1.3 per cent in the second half, underpinned by strong consumption growth. Underlying consumer price inflation is at its lowest rate in a decade; prices increased by 0.2 per cent in the March quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.0 per cent</span> higher over the year. ", " Most indicators of the Japanese economy remain very weak, though there are some signs that activity may have reached a trough. The rapid contraction in industrial production evident through early 1998 appears to have been arrested towards the end of the year, with production remaining virtually unchanged since. ", " Part of this stabilisation probably reflects the impact of higher public spending, which partially offset the weakness in the rest of the economy in the second half of 1998 (Graph 9). However, it is not clear yet whether the fiscal stimulus will result in a lasting boost to private spending. Consumer spending has been stagnant since the <span class=\"no-wrap\">April 1997</span> consumption tax increase. A series of income tax cuts in 1998 has failed to induce consumers to increase spending, in the face of falling wage incomes, and the impact on confidence of worsening employment prospects. Rising excess capacity, disruption in the process of financial intermediation, and record low levels of business sentiment have combined to depress business investment. ", " The extent of spare capacity in the Japanese economy is exerting downward pressure on prices; consumer prices declined by around half of a per cent over the year to March. The Bank of Japan allowed short-term money-market interest rates to fall to an effective rate of zero in March, although the efficacy of monetary policy in the current financial environment remains somewhat limited – Japan has had record low interest rates for some years now, with little obvious stimulus to aggregate demand. ", " Progress continues to be made in the reform of the Japanese financial system. The newly established prudential regulator, the Financial Revitalisation Agency, has approved applications from banks for infusions of public capital amounting to 7.5 trillion yen (US$63 billion). While this represents a take-up of only one-third of the funds set aside for capital injections, a further round of applications for public funds is expected later this year. Japanese banks have also benefited from recent strength in the Japanese share market; banks are currently allowed to count 45 per cent of the value of gains on their shareholdings as capital. This means that credit conditions may become increasingly supportive of growth. Signs that a trough has been reached in east Asia (which accounts for around half of Japan's exports) suggest that the external sector may be less of a drag on growth in the period ahead, but is unlikely to be strong enough to fuel an export-led recovery. ", " Activity generally slowed across the 11 euro area countries in the latter stages of 1998, principally reflecting a deterioration in export demand. The weakness in exports is evident in both intra-European trade and exports outside Europe and, in part, may reflect a loss in the market share of European producers. Consumer spending has supported growth, in line with very high levels of consumer confidence. In contrast, business sentiment continues to weaken, in part reflecting the weaker external environment. Among the larger euro economies, activity in France has been stronger than that in both Germany and Italy. The smaller euro area economies have experienced faster growth than the large countries, a trend likely to be accentuated by the significant decline in their interest rates that has occurred over the past year. Inflation across the euro area remains particularly low. The harmonised measure of inflation, which calculates price movements across countries on a consistent basis, is around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>. Inflation in the smaller euro countries has generally been running at a higher rate, in line with their stronger economic growth. ", " Inflation has been unexpectedly low in a number of countries over the past year. In the United States, as discussed above, inflation has continued to decline, despite the expansion of the economy beyond previous estimates of sustainable capacity. In a number of east Asian countries, where high rates of inflation had been expected to ensue following their sharp currency depreciations, the actual increases in inflation were quite limited and temporary. There are also a few economies in the region – Japan, Singapore, China and Hong Kong – where consumer prices have been declining, either as a result of economic recessions or sharp reductions in import prices from the rest of the Asian region. ", " For the major industrial countries as a group, consumer price inflation is currently running at an average rate of just over 1 per cent, its lowest since the early 1960s. Export prices of these countries (in original currency terms) have been flat or declining over the past two years and, over the year to December 1998, they declined by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> (Graph 10). This difference between consumer and export price movements does not appear significantly out of line with past experience: export prices for industrial goods have typically increased by a few percentage points less than consumer prices each year, reflecting the faster average productivity growth in the traded goods sector. ", " Against this background, the question arises as to whether the east Asian currency depreciations are providing a source of additional disinflationary pressure at the global level. There are two aspects to this: the direct price effects flowing from these currency movements, and the broader impact of the Asian financial crisis through its effects on global activity. ", " In principle, currency movements do not in themselves create either inflation or disinflation at the global level, but redistribute inflationary pressures. In current circumstances, this would be expected to boost inflation among the crisis-affected Asian economies and to restrain inflation in the major industrial countries through lower import prices. This is broadly what has been observed although, as noted above, the effect on Asian inflation has been less than anticipated. Export price data suggest that the impact of depreciations has been partly taken in the form of higher domestic currency prices for Asian exporters, and partly as lower foreign currency prices for the foreign purchaser. Since June 1997, the average price of exports from east Asia has declined in US dollar terms by just over 10 per cent, compared with a decline of 1¼ per cent in the average price of exports from the <span class=\"no-wrap\">G7 economies</span>. In Korea and Thailand for instance, local currency export prices have risen by around 20 per cent over the same period, accounting for around two-thirds of the impact of their currency depreciations. Thus, price developments in the Asian economies are exerting some downward pressure on world traded goods prices (in US dollar terms), but not as much as might be suggested by the size of their exchange rate movements. ", " More generally, the Asian financial crisis, coupled with the pronounced weakness of the Japanese economy, has contributed to a decline in global GDP growth from over 4 per cent in 1996 to an estimated 2¼ per cent in 1998. This decline in growth implies an increasing degree of global excess capacity in the recent period, which can be viewed as the more basic source of global disinflationary pressures. When global growth picks up sufficiently, this excess capacity will be gradually absorbed, but some degree of disinflationary pressure may persist in the near term. ", " The Australian economy continued to grow strongly during 1998, despite the weakness in trading partner growth <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 11)</span>. Real GDP increased by 4.7 per cent over the year, and preliminary indications are that growth may have continued at only a slightly reduced pace in the early part of 1999. The overall growth in GDP has been sufficient to generate a continued decline in the unemployment rate, to a current level of 7.4 per cent. There has, however, been a notable change in the composition of growth, with private demand growth declining over recent quarters, to an annual rate of just under 3 per cent, from rates of around 6 per cent a year ago. Growth in public expenditure has increased sharply (Table 2). ", " Business investment and housing investment both declined in the December quarter, while the pace of growth in consumer spending has picked up strongly. Favourable financial conditions and rising asset prices have played an important role in supporting consumption growth, and should continue to do so in 1999. These factors also appear to be giving renewed support to other areas of private spending. Despite some downward revisions to investment intentions reported earlier in the year, overall business confidence is at high levels, and finance for both housing investment and businesses is growing strongly at present. ", " Consumption growth picked up to an annual rate of 5.5 per cent in the second half of 1998 from a rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.4 per cent</span> in the first half. The renewed strength in consumption was especially apparent in the services sector, with spending on recreation and other services growing particularly quickly. The strong momentum of retail spending continued in the early part of 1999. After falling by around 2 per cent in December, the estimated value of retail trade increased by more than 5 per cent in January in seasonally adjusted terms, and only retraced a small part of that gain in February (Graph 12). The monthly volatility probably reflects the difficulty associated with removing the seasonal element during the Christmas period as shopping patterns change. Looking through the volatility, growth between November and February averaged just under 1 per cent per month, a pick-up from the already strong growth through the second half of 1998. ", " An improvement in consumer confidence has been apparent since the middle of 1998. In the first half of the year, consumers had generally reported that their personal financial situations were reasonably good, but their assessments about the prospects for the Australian economy deteriorated sharply. In this environment, consumers may have felt it prudent to curtail expenditure on discretionary items or to delay the purchase of major household appliances. In the second half of the year, as the domestic economy continued to expand at a healthy rate and the unemployment rate edged down, consumers became increasingly optimistic that this good performance could be sustained. Currently, the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment is well above its decade average, and higher than the levels prevailing prior to the onset of the international financial crisis. ", " Spending on motor vehicles has evolved somewhat differently to other areas of consumption. Prompted by low interest rates and competitive pricing, sales of motor vehicles increased by 26 per cent between the start of 1997 and mid 1998, despite the weakening in consumer confidence towards the end of that period. For some households, spending on motor vehicles may have contributed to reduced growth in other areas of spending over that period. More recently, there has been some reversal of this pattern. Motor vehicle purchases have been roughly flat since the middle of 1998, while, as noted above, spending on other discretionary items has picked up markedly. ", " The growth of consumer spending has continued to outpace the growth of household disposable income, implying a further decline in the household saving ratio over the past year (although broader measures of saving have not fallen to the same extent – see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>). According to the national accounts, real household disposable income increased by 2¼ per cent over the year to the December quarter, with relatively strong growth in wage incomes being offset by higher tax payments and slower growth in other income components. While recorded income growth has been quite modest, strong increases in household wealth have been an important factor contributing to the recent performance of consumption. Since the asset price increases associated with this are not counted as income in the national accounts, the process has contributed to the overall decline in recorded household saving. ", " Growth in household wealth has been particularly robust since the end of 1995, with both physical and financial assets increasing (Table 3). Dwellings are by far the largest portion of household wealth, and house prices have increased steadily in recent years, including a 10 per cent increase in Sydney and Melbourne over the year to December 1998. In previous episodes of rapid house price increases, such as the late 1980s, the effects of the expansion of wealth on consumption were probably quite small. However, the increased availability of home equity lines of credit in recent years has made this wealth much more accessible and, since these products carry a lower interest charge than unsecured personal lending, borrowing against this expansion in wealth to fund consumption is more attractive. ", " The other main contributing factor to the rise in wealth has been the increase in share prices. Increasingly, households are seeking higher rates of return than are available on deposits, and are turning to the share market and managed funds with exposure to equities. Accordingly, household direct holdings of equities, while only a small proportion of total wealth, are rising strongly, both through net new purchases and increases in the price of existing holdings. The proportion of households owning shares is higher than in a number of comparable countries (see ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1999/mar/1.html\">Australian Financial Markets</a>’, <cite>Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin</cite>, March 1999). The increasing propensity to own shares has also been encouraged by a marked reduction in the costs of trading in shares due to the introduction of on-line services for this purpose. Some part of the increase in share ownership is also accounted for by holdings of a small number of high-profile stocks such as Telstra and AMP. The capital gains on these shares may have underpinned the recent pace of consumption growth. ", " The strength in consumption has also been encouraged by the low cost of borrowing. As nominal interest rates have fallen, households can manage the interest payments on larger loans, and more households can afford to borrow. Contributing to this effect, competition among financial intermediaries has generated larger interest rate reductions on home equity lines of credit than the fall in cash rates over the same period. Moreover, as mentioned above, the increased use of such products has further reduced average borrowing costs. ", " The above developments have resulted in relatively rapid growth in household debt, which increased by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> in the year to March (Graph 13). Financial deregulation and a shift to low inflation have brought about a similar expansion in household indebtedness in other comparable countries. Indeed, as a ratio to income, the indebtedness of Australian households is about average compared with other countries, after starting from a relative low point in the early 1990s. Nevertheless, a continued period of rapid growth in household credit could generate concern, given that households will have to service their higher debt levels out of nominal incomes that are growing at a much slower rate than in the higher-inflation era of the 1970s and 1980s. ", " One of the factors contributing to weaker overall growth in private demand in the second half of 1998 was a decline in dwelling investment. After a couple of years of strong growth, housing investment activity reached a peak in the middle of 1998 and tailed off in the second half of the year. Over the year as a whole, dwelling investment rose by around 3 per cent, compared with growth of 16 per cent in 1997. ", " This pattern of growth was consistent with indicators of building approvals, commencements and finance commitments, which also weakened in the second half of the year (Graph 14). More recently, however, these forward indicators of housing activity have partly reversed those declines. After falling by around 7 per cent over the second half of 1998, the number of local building approvals has picked up in recent months. In the three months to February, building approvals were about 5 per cent higher than in the previous three months, with approvals for both houses and medium-density dwellings rebounding. The value of approvals for alterations and additions, while volatile, has picked up by almost 7 per cent over the same period. Housing loan approvals have also shown renewed strength, with the value of loan approvals rising by 6 per cent over the three months to February. ", " These signs of firmer demand appear to reflect the significant shift in the interest rate environment since mid 1998, with speculation about a possible interest rate increase around that time eventually giving way to the reduction in interest rates that occurred in December. Greater borrower confidence in the outlook for continued low interest rates is signalled in a switch back towards greater use of variable-rate housing loans, after a sharp swing towards fixed-rate loans in mid 1998, as borrowers sought to lock in what they saw as a trough in interest rates. Taken together, the recent pick-up in the forward indicators points to some increase in housing investment activity in the near term after the decline recorded in the second half of 1998 although, to keep this in perspective, the level of building approvals is still below the mid-1998 peak. ", " The recent strengthening of housing demand, and the more favourable credit conditions, have been reflected in higher house prices in a number of cities, as discussed above. This is particularly apparent in Sydney and Melbourne, where house prices have increased by around 10 per cent over the past year (Graph 15). In the March quarter, dwelling rents rose modestly in all capital cities except Brisbane, where they were unchanged. Over the past year, rents have increased by 3 per cent, slightly faster than the overall inflation rate, with increases being recorded in all capital cities. The continued increase in rents gives support to the view that the decline in housing activity in the second half of 1998 was not symptomatic of any generalised excess supply. ", " Businesses are experiencing favourable conditions overall, with most surveys showing that confidence has remained at high levels in the early part of 1999, following a sharp rebound at the end of last year (Graph 16). There are, however, some significant disparities in conditions across industries. In general, those industries whose business is mainly reliant on domestic demand are experiencing robust trading conditions. This includes much of the services sector such as property and business services, the communications industry and retailing. More difficult conditions are being experienced by those firms more exposed to foreign markets. This applies particularly to the mining industry, where output has been declining over the past year, and to tourism. In the manufacturing sector, sentiment has recovered strongly in the past six months, based on stronger expectations for new orders, exports and output. ", " Aggregate corporate profits, as measured by gross operating surplus, rose by 2½ per cent in the December quarter and by more than 13 per cent over 1998. This follows a period of weaker growth in 1996 and 1997. Corporate profits now stand at 15.4 per cent of GDP, a historical high, and well above the decade average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">14.2 per cent</span>. In line with the strength in economic activity over the past year, profits growth has been concentrated in the services sector in 1998, with the construction and the transport and storage industries experiencing particular strength. Manufacturers' reported profits have rebounded from their lows in 1996. However, profits in the mining sector fell sharply in the December quarter, and in 1998 were at their lowest level in ten years as a share of GDP. There is some evidence that profitability has been relatively stronger for larger firms. Both the company profits survey, which excludes some smaller businesses, and the half-yearly reporting round for listed companies, suggest that profits growth in 1998 was stronger for these firms than indicated by aggregate data on gross operating surplus. ", " The overall strength in profitability means that businesses have been well placed either to fund investment, or build their financial assets, from retained earnings, their primary funding source. External funding has also continued to expand, although there has been some change in its composition. Business credit has picked up in the past two quarters to grow at an annual rate of 10.2 per cent in the three months to March. In contrast, there were net redemptions of securities issued by non-financial firms directly into capital markets in the December quarter, although indications are that funding from this source has subsequently resumed. Equity issued by non-financial firms has remained at a high level, increasing from $5.8 billion in the September quarter to $8.8 billion in the December quarter, with overseas investors taking much of the increase. ", " Sustained low inflation and heightened competition between financial intermediaries have brought about lower nominal interest rates on business loans. This has contained the servicing costs of corporate debt, despite steadily rising debt levels. Currently, net interest payments are absorbing around 20 per cent of operating profits; this ratio has shown little change over the past few years, but is well below the levels typical a decade ago. Equity raisings have also been relatively inexpensive: the price-earnings ratio is around its peak over the past 40 years <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 17)</span>. ", " The underlying strength in gross profitability and the low cost of finance implies that the business sector is not presently constrained by the availability of funds for investment. Nonetheless, and despite the recovery in business sentiment towards the end of 1998, recorded business investment declined sharply in the December quarter, to a level almost 3 per cent below that of a year earlier. The overall weakness in investment in the December quarter was concentrated in machinery and equipment spending, although buildings and structures investment also declined a little. Machinery and equipment investment has now fallen by more than 12 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>. ", " There has also been a general downward revision to the investment outlook as recorded in recent surveys of business investment intentions. Private business surveys, although giving quite volatile results recently, have generally been pointing to a weaker investment outlook, despite showing a recovery in overall business sentiment. These results appear broadly consistent with the ABS Capital Expenditure Survey for the December quarter, conducted in the January/February period (Graph 18). Based on average realisation ratios, the survey implies that nominal investment spending in 1998–99 as a whole will be marginally lower than in the previous year. This expectation has been progressively revised down over the past three surveys. However, given the size of the actual decline in investment in the December quarter, this expectation would still imply a modest rebound in the short term. The Survey also contained the first estimate of investment in 1999/2000. It suggests a broadly stable level of investment for the year ahead, although it needs to be kept in mind that the first estimate of investment is not particularly reliable. ", " Most of the overall weakness in expected investment is accounted for by the mining industry, although intentions have been revised down, to a lesser extent, in most other industries, with the transport sector being the notable exception. The weaker outlook for mining investment follows a period of exceptionally rapid growth. Between 1995 and 1998, the level of mining investment increased over 50 per cent, with a number of large projects in base metals, coal and gas being undertaken. The sharp anticipated decline in mining investment over the next year reflects the completion of some of these large projects, which is occurring at a time of low commodity prices, weak export demand and declining profits in the industry. In addition, many Olympic-related projects (such as hotels), which have supported construction investment over the past few years, will be approaching completion over the coming year (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). Non-residential building approvals weakened somewhat in the second half of 1998 and, although they have recovered in the first couple of months of 1999, the current level of approvals would not be sufficient to sustain activity at its current rate. ", " The overall softness of the forward indicators of investment contrasts, at present, with the sizeable quantities of funds apparently being raised by businesses. This could be partly related to takeover activity, but it may also be indicative of some pick-up in business investment plans that is not yet evident in the conventional surveys of investment intentions. While profits in most areas remain in good shape, funding costs low, and confidence in the economy's performance high, it seems unlikely that the flat spot in overall investment will prove other than <span class=\"no-wrap\">short-lived</span>. ", " Reflecting the strength of output growth over the past year, employment has continued to increase at a pace sufficient to generate a steady reduction in unemployment. Total employment increased by 2.1 per cent over the year to March, although growth over the past few months was a little slower than that recorded in the second half of last year. There has been some easing in full-time employment growth since mid 1998, while the part-time component has continued to increase at a more rapid pace, continuing the longer-term trend towards a greater share of part-time employment in the economy. The unemployment rate averaged 7.4 per cent in the March quarter, over half a percentage point lower than it was six months earlier (Graph 19). Participation in the labour force by both males and females over the past year or so has been somewhat weaker than suggested by their typical cyclical behaviour. In previous economic cycles, strong growth in the economy tended to draw people into the labour force; in contrast, the participation rate has declined slightly over the past year. ", " Employment growth over the past year has been strongest in the public sector and a range of private-sector service industries which, as discussed above, have generally been the industries showing the strongest performance in terms of output growth and reported business conditions; retail trade, property and business services, health and community services, and transport and storage accounted for most of the increase in total employment over the year. Employment in the construction sector was also significantly higher in the March quarter than a year earlier, but has fallen appreciably since the end of 1998, reflecting the completion of some Olympics-related projects and the temporary slowdown in housing construction in the second half of last year. Manufacturing employment continues to decline, despite the pick-up in manufacturing output over the second half of 1998; this continues the long-run trend in employment in that industry. ", " While the labour market has clearly benefited from the overall strength of the economy over the past two years, employment growth appears to have lagged the growth in output a little more than usual (Graph 20). This may be related to a degree of caution on the part of employers during 1998 in the face of uncertainties about the international outlook, as well as the possibility that the strength of the domestic economy was underestimated by many employers. With output growth running ahead of employment, the result has been a very rapid increase in labour productivity, which rose at a rate of 3¼ per cent during 1998. This could be indicative of a further step up from the already-high average rates of productivity growth which have been maintained through the 1990s economic expansion. More likely, it is indicative that further expansion in employment will follow the strong output growth of last year. ", " Most forward-looking labour-market indicators continue to point to firm labour demand in the near term. Vacancies data have been volatile in recent months; in March, the ANZ Bank and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business measures both reached their highest points in nine years, although the latter measure fell back in April. The ABS measure of vacancies declined in the three months to February and is <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> lower than its level a year earlier. This series has, however, displayed considerable volatility in recent quarters and become more difficult to interpret; relative to previous cycles, the series remains at a level consistent with continued employment growth. Hiring intentions, as measured by the major business surveys, have been firmer recently. They were initially dampened by the effects of the Asian economic crisis, but have picked up in the past quarter in line with the overall improvement in business confidence (Graph 21). ", " Farm output rose by about 3¼ per cent in 1998. The winter grain crop, at about 32 million tonnes, was <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> larger than in the previous year, but late frosts and persistent heavy rains adversely affected grain quality and yields. The summer crop is forecast by ABARE to yield a record 4.4 million tonnes, following a significant increase in the area sown and generally favourable seasonal conditions. This year's winter grain crop is forecast to be around 3 per cent larger than last year. ", " Wool production is forecast by ABARE to drop to 605,000 tonnes in 1999/2000, the smallest wool clip in more than 20 years, reflecting a switch by farmers into other activities; wool prices have recovered from their lows of October, but demand for wool has been weak, and is expected to remain so, reflecting both the weakness in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asia and the continued</span> competitive pressures from synthetic fibres. The Federal Government has introduced legislation to create a new body, WoolStock Australia, which will take control of the official wool stockpile. ", " Good spring rainfall has contributed to excellent pastoral conditions in most of Australia's cattle-producing regions. However cattle slaughterings have increased, rising by 7½ per cent in the year to the second half of 1998. This has kept meat exports strong over that period. ABARE expects some herd re-building to occur over the next couple of years which could result in reduced slaughterings. ", " The economic problems in the Asian region, and the slowdown in global growth, have had a marked impact on Australia's external accounts (Graph 22). Although export earnings initially continued to grow in the face of the weakening external environment, they have turned down quite sharply since around the middle of 1998. In the March quarter, export earnings declined by 2½ per cent, following a decline of just under 4 per cent in the previous quarter. These declines mainly reflected falling export prices, although there was probably some decline in volume terms in the March quarter. The weak performance of exports in the recent period contrasts with average annual growth (in both volume and value terms) of 8–9 per cent over the 1990–97 period. ", " Much of the recent decline in export earnings has been concentrated in the resources sector, which accounts for around 40 per cent of total exports. After growing strongly until mid 1998, resource exports have since fallen by a total of 14 per cent (Graph 23), reflecting a combination of weaker commodity prices and reductions in volumes. Demand for resources from Japan has weakened considerably, and price declines may have encouraged some cutbacks in Australia's minerals production. In contrast, rural export earnings have picked up over the past year from the trough reached in early 1998. The increase reflects substantial increases in volumes as a result of favourable domestic production conditions, and some recovery in demand from east Asian markets, although declining rural commodity prices have limited the overall rise in earnings. Of the other components of exports, manufactured exports – previously the fastest growing component – have remained weak for much of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>. Service exports picked up in the March quarter, reflecting some recovery in tourism. ", " The weakening in Australia's export performance in the recent period suggests that the scope for further rapid diversion of exports to the faster-growing regions of the world may be limited. In the early period following the onset of the Asian crisis in mid 1997, the loss of exports to the crisis-affected economies had, to a significant degree, been offset by stronger growth in sales to the US, Europe, and other markets (Table 4). This trade diversion was particularly evident for resource exports, where commodities are relatively homogeneous and can in many cases be sold in alternative markets at prevailing world prices. The recent indications, however, suggest that this has not continued. After growing strongly up until around the middle of 1998, aggregate exports to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US and Europe</span> levelled out in the second half of the year and appear to have declined in the March quarter 1999, with much of the fall accounted for by resource exports. There are now some signs that demand for Australia's exports from the initial crisis-affected countries, particularly Korea, is beginning to recover. At the same time, however, a significant further deterioration of conditions in Japan has seen the value of Australian exports to that destination fall by around 8 per cent over the past year. Reductions in contract prices of bulk commodities, which are taking effect from April, will exert a further dampening influence on export revenues in the current quarter. ", " Import values have shown considerable volatility in recent months but increased by around 5½ per cent over the year to the March quarter. Preliminary indications are that growth in volume terms was a bit higher: the import deflator fell slightly over the year, declining significantly in the two latest quarters after substantial increases in the wake of Australia's currency depreciation. In the March quarter itself, import values were little changed, with increases in consumption and capital goods imports being offset by weaker imports of intermediate goods. ", " The overall pace of growth in imports during the past year has been slower than has been typical in recent years, and slower than might have been expected given the strong growth in domestic expenditure. The impact of the currency depreciation may be part of the reason for this. Despite the recent unwinding of part of the import price increases flowing from the depreciation, import prices are still around 10 per cent higher than they were in <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1997</span>, which may have helped to restrain import demand in some areas. In the case of consumption imports, however, this explanation is at odds with the fact that import prices to the consumer have continued <span class=\"no-wrap\">to decline (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#inflation-trends-and-prospects\">Inflation Trends and Prospects</a>’)</span>. ", " Continued growth in import values coupled with falling exports has seen a widening of Australia's current account deficit. In the December quarter, the deficit reached a level of 5.4 per cent of GDP. Monthly trade data suggest that the trade component of the deficit widened further in the March quarter, by perhaps around ½ per cent of GDP. Assuming the net income deficit remains roughly unchanged as a proportion of GDP (as it has done over the past year), this would imply a current account deficit of around 6 per cent of GDP in the quarter. ", " Australia's net foreign liabilities increased by $8.6 billion in the December quarter, raising the stock of net foreign liabilities to nearly 60 per cent of GDP. This increase was accounted for by rising net foreign equity liabilities; net foreign debt fell a little in the quarter. Australia's ability to service its net foreign liabilities is little changed from recent levels. The ratio of Australia's net income payments to exports, at 17.3 per cent, remains near its historical average, and well below the 1980s peak. Both net interest payments and net equity income payments have been declining relative to exports in recent years. The net income deficit rose by just over 2 per cent in the December quarter to $4.8 billion, 3.2 per cent of GDP, mainly reflected rising dividend payments to foreign holders of Australian shares. ", " In aggregate, commodity prices in SDR terms appear to have stabilised since the beginning of the year but remain more than 13 per cent lower than their levels of a year ago (Graph 24). The recent stabilisation reflects, in part, some improvement in market sentiment about the outlook for the world economy, but also reflects cuts in the production of a number of resource commodities. For Australian exporters, recently negotiated cuts to bulk commodity prices (iron ore and coal) of between 10 and 20 per cent (in US dollar terms) are taking effect from April. These price reductions will be reflected in measures of Australia's terms of trade from the June quarter. ", " Base metal prices have risen somewhat from their trough at the beginning of the year. There have been substantial improvements in zinc and nickel prices largely as a result of announced mine closures, both domestically and overseas. Following weakness over the first few months of 1999, aluminium and copper prices have also increased strongly in April in anticipation of cutbacks in production. Gold prices have softened, however, following a decision to end the legal backing of the Swiss franc by gold, and with an increase in the likelihood of gold sales by the IMF to finance debt relief for poor nations. The recent announcement from OPEC countries that oil production will be cut by some 7 per cent has seen the price of oil rise sharply, from just under US$11 a barrel, to over US$18 a barrel. While this has reversed all of the decline in oil prices since the beginning of 1998, the real price of oil remains very low by historical standards (Graph 25). ", " The prices of some rural products have shown tentative signs of recovery, with solid increases (3–6 per cent) in the prices of wool, beef, rice and barley; sugar prices, however, fell by a further 14 per cent in the March quarter, and are now some 37 per cent lower than the March quarter of last year. The recent fall in sugar prices reflects expectations of lower US dollar prices from Brazilian producers following the depreciation of the <em>real</em> since January, as well as strong prospects for sugar crops elsewhere and weak demand from non-Asian importers. ", " Financial intermediaries' variable-rate lending rates were reduced after the 2 December monetary policy easing. As discussed in ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1999/feb/1.html\">The Economy and Financial Markets</a>’, published in February, the extent of the cuts to intermediaries' lending rates varied among intermediaries and from product to product, but were broadly in line with the reduction in the cash rate. They were also passed on to borrowers more quickly than in the five easings of 1996–97. Since the reductions associated with the easing, intermediaries' variable lending rates have been largely unchanged (Graph 26). The movements in intermediaries' rates, and their current level are summarised in Table 5. A longer-term perspective is contained in ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1999/apr/1.html\">Recent Developments in Interest Rates on Bank Lending</a>’ in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Reserve Bank's</span> <cite>Bulletin</cite> of April 1999. ", " Interest rates on fixed-rate loans have declined in recent years, as rates in capital markets – where banks fund such loans – have fallen (Graph 27). The average rate on new housing loans for terms fixed for three years is currently about 6.6 per cent, up slightly from the trough of 6.4 per cent reached in early 1999, but considerably lower than in earlier years. Similarly, indicator rates on three-year fixed small business loans are currently around <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.7 per cent</span>. As Graph 27 shows, these interest rates move in parallel with interest rates in swap markets. ", " Measures of real interest rates (defined using a range of indicator rates and alternative measures of inflation expectations) have declined slightly over the past six months, from levels that were already below historical averages. As discussed above, cash rates declined by 25 basis points following the December easing in monetary policy, leading to similar cuts in intermediaries' lending rates. There has also been a small increase in the Melbourne Institute measure of inflation expectations recently (discussed in more detail in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#inflation-trends-and-prospects\">Inflation Trends and Prospects</a>’), which reduces the measures of real interest rates calculated using that series. The measures shown in Table 6 suggest that real interest rates on standard variable-rate loans for both small business and housing are now well below the levels reached in the early 1990s. The real cash rate is currently close to its trough in the early 1990s. Real interest rates as measured by yields on indexed (inflation-adjusted) bonds are also close to historical lows, although they have increased slightly in the past couple of months. ", " Credit growth has picked up in the past six months to an annual rate of around 12 per cent, more than reversing the brief slowdown in growth seen in mid 1998. Underpinned by stronger business confidence, business credit growth has increased from an annual rate of around 7 per cent in the three months to October, to grow by an annual rate of just over 10 per cent in the three months to March (Table 7). The acceleration in personal credit has been even more marked. The strength in December and January has boosted the annualised growth rate of personal credit to 19 per cent in the six months to March. While increased usage of credit cards for transaction purposes has contributed to this growth, much of the growth is accounted for by residentially secured lines of credit to households. As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’ above, the increasing affordability and access to this form of credit appears to have been a factor supporting the growth in consumer spending in the recent period. Housing credit growth has remained strong in recent months, although growth in lending for investment purposes has eased a little since mid 1998. ", " The strong rate of credit growth since the middle of 1998 has been funded, in part, by increases in deposits, and also offshore borrowing. Rapid growth in credit to the private sector has also been offset to some extent by relatively weak lending to the public sector over recent months. Growth in the monetary aggregates slowed in the second half of 1998, but in the first few months of 1999 this appears to have reversed, with faster growth in fixed deposits. Currency growth has declined in recent months, but still is faster than growth in nominal income. ", " Strong growth in the community's holdings of other types of financial assets has continued. Funds under management rose by 3 per cent in the December quarter, in line with the rebound in domestic and overseas share markets. Over the year to the December quarter the value of managed funds rose by over 12 per cent, well in excess of growth in alternative savings vehicles such as deposits. Cash management trusts continued to record the fastest growth, but they remain a small share of total funds under management (Table 8). Of the assets held by fund managers, overseas assets increased strongly during the December quarter, rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7½ per cent</span> despite the negative valuation impact of the appreciation of the $A against the US dollar in the quarter. Holdings of domestic equities rose by 5 per cent in the quarter. Funds' holdings of cash and bank deposits declined by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3¾ per cent</span> from the high levels of the September quarter. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell by 0.1 per cent in the March quarter, but rose by 1.2 per cent over the year to the March quarter (Graph 28). The March quarter outcome reflects, in part, the introduction of the Government's 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, which led to a sharp reduction in the price of hospital and medical services in the quarter and contributed 0.7 percentage points to the fall in the CPI. Further falls in automotive fuel, clothing and communication services were also recorded. These movements were only partially offset by seasonal price increases for Pharmaceuticals, domestic holiday travel and education. ", " Abstracting from these transitory influences, measures of <em>underlying</em> inflation suggest prices increased by around ½ to ¾ per cent in the March quarter and by 1½ to 2 per cent over the year (Table 9).Within the underlying CPI basket, motor vehicle prices continued to decline, falling by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.3 per cent</span> over the past year. Motor vehicle prices have subtracted an average of 0.5 percentage points from the underlying inflation rate in each of the past three years. The price of household equipment also fell in the March quarter. Offsetting these falls were higher-than-average increases in the prices of many food items and a 1.5 per cent rise in ‘house purchase’ costs; the latter contributed 0.2 percentage points to the increase in the underlying CPI in the March quarter. The rise in the house-price component occurred despite lower <span class=\"no-wrap\">building-materials</span> prices, and may reflect higher growth in construction labour costs than in other sectors. ", " Private-sector goods prices have continued to increase at a noticeably slower pace than the price of private-sector services (Graph 29). The difference is mainly accounted for by the prices of imported goods in the CPI which, contrary to most expectations, have continued to decline (see below). In the March quarter the price of imported goods fell by 0.4 per cent, to show a decline of more than 2 per cent over the past year. Within that category, prices of imported motor vehicles fell only slightly in the quarter but, after earlier rapid declines, are now <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.8 per cent</span> lower than a year earlier; the price of other imported goods fell by a greater extent in the latest quarter. In contrast, the rate of increase in prices of domestically produced goods has picked up over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>, to a rate of 1.9 per cent. With service prices rising somewhat more quickly than that, overall domestically sourced inflation in goods and services prices is running at a little over 2 per cent. ", " In contrast to the continued decline in import prices at the consumer level, noted above, import prices as recorded at the docks are substantially higher than they were two years ago. In broad terms, the movement in dock prices of imports has reflected developments in Australia's exchange rate. The Australian dollar depreciated by about 12 per cent in import-weighted terms between the first half of 1997 and the December quarter 1998, and by almost 20 per cent against the currencies of the major industrial countries. The difference between these two summary measures reflects the disparities between Australia's exchange rate movements against the currencies of the major countries and those of crisis-affected Asia in particular. Given these disparities, there was always some uncertainty about the size of the total impact of Australia's currency depreciation on import prices at the docks. It now appears that this impact reached its peak in the September quarter 1998, when dock prices were 13 per cent higher than their level in mid 1997. Declines in these prices in the December and March quarters have subsequently unwound about 3 percentage points of that increase. ", " The overall increase in import prices at the docks over the recent period appears to have been limited by the extremely competitive conditions prevailing in world product markets. As discussed in detail in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-economic-developments\">International Economic Developments</a>’, prices of exports of the major industrial countries (which are the main sources of Australia's imports) declined by around 2½ per cent in original currency terms during 1998. An additional factor in the December quarter may have been the strengthening of the $A against the US dollar in the quarter, which may have had a temporary downward impact on prices to the extent that imports were invoiced in US dollars. More recently, there has been a more broadly based strengthening of the Australian dollar, in terms of both the import-weighted index and the major industrial countries' currencies. This has yet to have its full effect on import prices at the docks, but may have contributed to the decline in dock prices recorded in <span class=\"no-wrap\">the March quarter</span>. ", " Notwithstanding the most recent declines in dock prices of imports, they remain around 10 per cent higher than their level of mid 1997. The continued decline in import prices at the consumer level is therefore quite unusual in light of previous experience (Graph 30). On the face of it, this lack of pass-through of price rises from the docks to consumers would suggest that importers' or retailers' margins are being heavily squeezed, with price rises at the docks being absorbed over a much longer period than usual. Another part of the explanation, with somewhat different implications, may be that effective prices offered by foreign suppliers have not risen by as much as official data suggest, as a result of rebates or incentives offered direct to the final purchaser. ", " Motor vehicles, which have accounted for more than half of the overall decline in import prices at the consumer level over the past two years, provide an interesting case study of these issues (<a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>). There the evidence suggests that both of the factors discussed above have been at work in the recent period. There appears to have been some reductions in wholesalers' margins in the car industry, while rebates initiated by foreign suppliers also appear to have contributed to price reductions at the retail level. The process appears to have been stimulated by lower prices on Korean cars stemming from the Korean currency depreciation. To the extent that importers' margins have been significantly reduced over the recent period, it may suggest some pressure for margins to be rebuilt at a later date. ", " Producer price indicators for the manufacturing and construction industries suggest that price pressures have continued to ease over the recent period (Table 10). Final prices of manufactured goods (excluding petroleum) declined by 0.4 per cent in the March quarter and were unchanged over the latest year, having risen at <span class=\"no-wrap\">an annual rate</span> of just under 2 per cent a year earlier. The weaker trend in manufacturers' output prices mainly reflects some significant falls in their input costs that have resulted from declining commodity prices over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>. Prices of domestically sourced inputs fell by 2.6 per cent over the latest year, and imported input prices also declined, after some earlier sharp increases flowing from the currency depreciation. The largest falls in manufacturers' output prices in the March quarter were for petroleum and basic metal products (particularly aluminium), in line with declining prices in world markets. However, the recent rebound in oil prices, and the firmer tone in a number of other commodity markets, points to some pick-up in manufacturers' input costs in the period ahead. Prices of building materials showed little movement in the March quarter and have increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">¾ to 1 per cent</span> over the past year. ", " The Wage Cost Index (WCI) for total pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 3.1 per cent over the year to the December quarter 1998, down slightly from the previous reading of 3.3 per cent (Table 11). While this index has only a short history, it is conceptually the best indicator of wage rates for a basket of constant-quality jobs, and suggests that the underlying growth in wages remains subdued. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE), which is a ‘wages bill’ rather than a ‘wage rate’ concept, was for some time growing at annual rates of just over 4 per cent. However, preliminary data indicate that AWOTE increased by only 0.1 per cent in the three months to February, and by 3 per cent over the latest year, bringing the annual rate into line with the latest annual increase in the WCI. ", " Both measures of wages growth suggest that wages have been increasing more quickly in the public sector than in the private sector. Private-sector AWOTE increased by 3.6 per cent over the year to November 1998, compared with an increase of 6 per cent recorded for the public sector. The latter figure appears unrealistically high, given the size of the increases being yielded by public-sector enterprise agreements, and may be affected by compositional changes in public-sector employment. The WCI suggests a smaller gap of around half a percentage point between public- and private-sector wages growth over 1998. ", " The expansion in the demand for labour over the past year does not seem to have put any general upward pressure on wages growth in the enterprise-bargaining stream. New enterprise agreements in the December quarter yielded average annualised wage increases of 3.8 per cent, much the same as have been recorded throughout the past year, although down from the levels that were typical 18 months ago (Graph 31). The construction industry remains the main area where stronger wage pressures are evident, with recent agreements yielding increases of the order of 7 per cent. In contrast, increases negotiated in the manufacturing industry have generally eased over the past year, to rates that are now around the economy-wide average. ", " Recent business surveys confirm the absence of any general upward pressure on wages growth. The March quarter NAB survey indicated that for the third consecutive quarter, expectations of increases in labour costs were around 0.5 per cent for the quarter ahead. The ABS survey of business expectations, also taken in the March quarter, suggests some downward revision to expected wages growth. ", " There are signs that the pace of growth of executive remuneration is now easing. According to the Mercer Cullen Egan Dell survey, the rate of increase over the year to the March quarter was 4.7 per cent, the lowest reading in over 4½ years, although still well above the growth of average wages. ", " The Australian Industrial Relations Commission announced its decision on the Safety Net Review on 29 April, which will determine increases in award wages over the next year. The Commission granted an increase of $12 per week in award rates up to and including $510 per week and an increase of $10 per week in award rates over <span class=\"no-wrap\">$510 per week</span>. The federal minimum wage was raised by 3.2 per cent to $385.40. This compares with the increases granted by the Commission last year, which were between $10–$ 14, with an increase in the minimum wage of 3.9 per cent. ", " Recent indicators of inflation expectations present rather disparate results across the community. Consumers' expectations of inflation have increased in recent months, as well as showing greater volatility. Business expectations of inflation, in contrast, remain very low. ", " Business surveys indicate that firms expect only small increases in their selling prices in the near term. According to the March quarter NAB survey, firms expect to increase prices by only a ¼ per cent in the next three months, down from around a ½ per cent a year ago. The ABS survey of business expectations indicated that firms expect no change in selling prices over the year to the March quarter 2000; this is almost 1 percentage point lower than their average expectation over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>, and the lowest reading since the inception of the survey over five years ago. The survey suggests that small and medium-sized businesses expect prices to fall over the year ahead. The March quarter ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported that a greater number of firms expected to decrease than to increase prices in the June quarter. The generally low inflation expectations among businesses could be explained by a number of factors, including the fact that they are referring mainly to producer rather than consumer prices, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">weaker-than-anticipated</span> pass-through of the effects of currency depreciation in the recent period, continuing moderation in wage outcomes, and the general absence of inflationary pressures internationally. ", " Forecasts of inflation by financial-market economists, as surveyed by the Bank following the release of the March quarter CPI, have not markedly changed since three months ago (Table 12). An underlying inflation rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.8 per cent</span> is expected over the year to June 1999. Expectations for the headline CPI over the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">June 1999</span> have been reduced because the impact of the health insurance rebate in lowering the price of health services in the March quarter is now more accurately understood. For the year to June 2000, market economists forecast an inflation rate of 2.1 per cent in both headline and underlying terms. The longer-term expectation for inflation by financial-market participants remains low. Inflation expectations as implied by the difference between the 10-year bond yield and the indexed bond yield of the same maturity are now just under 2 per cent, having increased slightly since the start of the year. ", " By contrast, consumers' expectations of inflation for the coming year are significantly higher than a year ago <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 32)</span>. The median response from the Melbourne Institute survey of inflation expectations has fluctuated quite widely in recent months, but has clearly increased, averaging 4.6 per cent thus far in 1999, compared with an average of 3.8 per cent in the second half of 1998. The volatility in this measure appears to be explained partly by the fact that responses tend to be concentrated on particular whole numbers (especially 0, 2, 3, 5 and 10) combined with uncertainties about higher inflation – perhaps induced by currency weakness – leading respondents to change their expectations in discrete jumps. In order to abstract from some of this volatility, a ‘trimmed mean’ is calculated as the average of the middle 80 per cent of responses. This suggests an increase in expected inflation of a little under ½ a percentage point since late 1998. ", " As noted above, consumer prices for goods and services sourced domestically have risen by just over 2 per cent over the past year. Overall inflation has been held down to a surprising degree by declining import prices. Even so, the underlying inflation rate has tended to drift up, to its current level of 1.7 per cent. While there may be some element of noise in the latest, relatively large quarterly increase in the underlying CPI, the latest two quarters taken together still suggest a slight pick-up in the inflation rate. ", " The prospective behaviour of import prices represents an important source of uncertainty for the inflation outlook. It is clear that there are significant disinflationary pressures operating in international traded goods markets at present, with prices of traded industrial goods declining noticeably in foreign currency terms over the past year. With the global economy growing at a below-trend rate, there is every prospect that these disinflationary pressures in international markets will persist in the near term. In the Bank's judgment, however, it remains more likely than not that some of the import price increase seen at the docks will show up eventually in consumer prices. If consumer import prices were merely to stop falling, that would contribute to some further pick-up in the inflation rate. While some increase in import prices in the near term remains the most likely outcome, however, some further downward pressure cannot be ruled out if international competitive pressures were to intensify further. Such pressure would be more likely to be transmitted were the exchange rate to appreciate significantly. ", " Part of the recent containment of inflation has presumably reflected lower raw materials prices, driven by declines in commodity prices, most prominently oil. This process now looks to have run its course. Oil prices have increased sharply in recent months, and this should soon begin to have an effect on input prices and on the headline CPI (its direct effect is excluded from underlying measures). More generally, many commodity markets have taken on a firmer tone after the sharp price falls seen during 1998. Taken together, these developments suggest that commodity prices are unlikely to exert the same disinflationary effect this year as they did in 1998. ", " Domestic cost pressures remain well contained. The most plausible indicator of wage costs, the wage cost index, is currently increasing at just over 3 per cent. Total labour costs, including on-costs, are probably increasing slightly more quickly but, given strong productivity growth, unit labour cost growth is quite subdued. The labour market appears to be showing greater flexibility than in previous business cycles, with no evidence at this stage of any general upward pressure on wage settlements despite the continuation of strong economic growth and declining unemployment. These outcomes suggest that the economy has scope to continue expanding at a good pace over the next year without generating a significant pick-up in domestic cost pressures. Inflation expectations of businesses remain low, but there has been a noticeable increase in consumer inflation expectations over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past six months</span>. ", " On balance, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation will gradually increase to around 2 per cent by the end of 1999, and remain at around that level into the following year. The CPI will show a lower annual rate until early next year, reflecting the reduction in health costs associated with the health care rebate in the March quarter, although increasing petrol prices are likely to partly offset this in coming quarters. For the purposes of evaluating inflation relative to the target, the Bank will, of course, abstract from the health care effect. From the September quarter 2000, both the headline and underlying measures will be increased noticeably by the introduction of the proposed GST. As explained previously, the Bank will look through the direct effect of the GST in assessing inflation for monetary policy purposes. ", " The Asian financial crisis has shown, among other things, that healthy financial intermediaries are essential to the efficient operation of an economy. Many of the east Asian countries that experienced financial difficulties – Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand – have begun a process of restructuring and repairing their financial systems: closing unviable institutions, removing the burden of <span class=\"no-wrap\">non-performing</span> loans (NPLs) from remaining banks and other financial intermediaries, and recapitalising viable institutions. There has been significant progress even though the methods of intervention and resolution, and the stage of progress, vary between countries. ", " Table A1 shows official estimates of non-performing loans at financial institutions following the Asian crisis. The size of the problem is large, although cross-country comparisons are complicated by different reporting and provisioning requirements. In Korea and Malaysia, non-performing loans in late 1998 were estimated at 23 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, of total loans outstanding. In Thailand, they were more than double this. Official estimates are not currently available for Indonesia but market estimates of NPLs mostly range between 65 and 75 per cent of total loans. ", " In some countries, non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) play an important part of the intermediation process and official estimates of NPLs are predominantly for that sector. In Korea, for example, the figure of 23 per cent of total loans relates to the financial sector as a whole, including NBFIs. The Financial Supervisory Commission has announced that only 8 per cent of loans at banks are non-performing. ", " Countries have adopted a variety of methods in dealing with weak institutions (Table A2). In some cases, the authorities have focused on closing unviable institutions; for example, there has been substantial closure of private banks and mergers of state banks in Indonesia. In other cases, the authorities have preferred to retain existing institutions but substantially restructure, merge and recapitalise them, as in Malaysia. <span class=\"no-wrap\">In Korea and Thailand</span>, the authorities have closed non-viable NBFIs but have chosen to merge or nationalise banks rather than close them. In all cases, the authorities expect further mergers to take place. ", " To enable banks and other financial intermediaries to resume lending, it is necessary to write off bad loans or remove impaired assets from their balance sheets. To this end, all countries have set up asset management vehicles (AMVs) which acquire NPLs and then sell them to the market, typically over a period of time to avoid ‘fire sale’ values. Generally, there is one AMV in each country, apart from Thailand which has provided for each bank to set up its own AMV (although it has one AMV for finance companies). Progress is most advanced in Korea and Malaysia (in the latter case, the process is expected to be complete by mid 1999). Some sales of distressed assets by AMVs have been made, but recovery rates are generally low, ranging between 12 and 48 per cent to date. Funds for AMVs are provided by deposit insurance corporations, the sale of distressed assets, bond issues and direct government or central bank funding. ", " Another focus of policy is to restore capital to international standards, but typically in graduated steps. Recapitalisation is being effected through different mechanisms. In all cases, public funds are being used – directly (Indonesia and Thailand), through the deposit insurance corporation (Korea) or through a special purpose vehicle (Danamodal in Malaysia) – often leaving the Government as majority owner of the banking system. In Indonesia, Korea and Thailand, use of foreign capital is part of the recapitalisation plan. Provisioning and reporting rules have also been generally tightened although they are not uniform between countries. ", " Financial restructuring has come at substantial fiscal cost. Fiscal costs are difficult to estimate: current IMF estimates range from 18 per cent of GDP in Korea and Malaysia to 32 per cent of GDP in Thailand, but market estimates are higher in some cases. In Scandinavia, the gross fiscal cost reached 17 per cent of GDP in Finland and 6 per cent in Sweden; in the United States, resolving the savings and loan crisis cost <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.4 per cent</span> of GDP. ", " Australia's household saving ratio, as measured in the national accounts, has declined substantially over the past two decades. In the December quarter, it reached 0.8 per cent, its lowest recorded level and well below the average of around 12 per cent prevailing in the early 1980s (Graph B1). Despite the severity of this longer-term decline, movements in broader measures of saving have been much less pronounced. Much of the recorded drop in household saving in recent years has been offset by increased saving by enterprises and governments, with the result that total national saving has been relatively stable. This Box provides further details. ", " Saving can be defined either in <em>gross</em> or <em>net</em> terms (that is, before or after deduction of depreciation from the measure of income). Differences between the trends in saving derived from the two concepts arise because depreciation has generally accounted for an increasing proportion of gross saving over time; net saving measures have therefore declined by more than gross measures. The most commonly cited indicator of saving in Australia, the household saving ratio shown in Graph B1, is a net measure. However, the difficulties of accurately estimating depreciation are such that gross measures are often used when making broader sectoral comparisons, as below. ", " Trends in the gross saving rates of the household, enterprise and general government sectors are summarised in Graph B2. Over the past two decades, gross household saving has approximately halved, from around 14 to around 7 per cent of GDP. After a period of relative stability during 1995 and 1996, the downward trend appears to have resumed in recent quarters. One of the contributing factors to the recent decline has probably been the impact of rising asset prices on household wealth. Since capital gains tend to stimulate consumption growth, but are not counted as income in the national accounts, a period of relatively strong growth in asset prices can contribute to a decline in recorded saving. ", " Enterprise saving (which represents the retained profits of businesses), has increased over the medium term, and has tended to move in a fashion that has partly offset movements in household saving. To some extent, this is likely to reflect the ownership link between the two sectors: households are the ultimate owners of much of the enterprise sector, and increases in retained earnings of businesses may act as a stimulus to household spending. For many purposes, therefore, it makes sense to think of household and enterprise saving as an aggregate. The total of household and enterprise saving has declined gradually in recent years, with the recent pick-up in enterprise saving insufficient to offset declining saving in the household sector. ", " The third component of aggregate saving, that of the general government sector, has increased strongly in recent years, reflecting a combination of cyclical and structural improvements in government fiscal positions. This has more than offset the recent net decline in the overall saving of households and enterprises, so that total national saving has increased steadily since the trough reached in the early 1990s recession. National saving as a proportion of GDP nonetheless remains about 2 percentage points lower than the average of the 1980s. ", " Movements in the current account deficit can in principle be attributed to movements in the national <span class=\"no-wrap\">saving-investment</span> balance: a larger current account deficit results from a decline in aggregate saving relative to aggregate investment. The existence of statistical discrepancies in the accounts, however, means that an exact reconciliation of these concepts is not possible; in the recent period, this measurement problem has been quite severe. Australia's current account deficit as a proportion of GDP was about <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ percentage</span> points higher in the December quarter 1998 than its average in 1996 (Table B1), yet national saving is estimated to have shown little change over that period, while aggregate investment increased only modestly. The increase in the current account deficit is mainly accounted for, in these estimates, by the movement in the statistical discrepancy. ", " This result suggests an important point of caution in interpreting the recent trends in estimated national saving. Assuming the current account balance to be the most reliable component of these calculations, eventual reconciliation of the accounts would imply a larger net widening of the saving-investment gap over the recent period. This may mean that the underlying trend in national saving has been less favourable, or that investment has been higher, than is implied by current estimates. ", " Investment expenditure associated with the Olympics includes that on venues (such as Stadium Australia) and related facilities (such as the Olympics Village) and that on projects indirectly linked to the Olympics, such as hotels. The total construction cost of Olympic venues and related facilities is expected to be around $3½ billion, two-thirds being funded by the public sector (Table C1). This amount, equivalent to a little over half of one per cent of annual Australian GDP, is spread mainly over a period of five years beginning in 1995/96, with privately funded construction mainly concentrated in the current financial year. The greatest stimulus to <em>growth</em> probably occurred in 1996/97. ", " The prospect of increased tourist numbers, including in the period after the Olympics, has also boosted private investment in other infrastructure. For example, work done on hotels in NSW has increased strongly since 1995, albeit from a very low level, whereas such activity has shown no net increase in the rest of the country. Upgrading of facilities at Sydney Airport is also proceeding. The anticipated boost to tourist arrivals has also been one motivating factor behind some public infrastructure spending, such as the rail link to Sydney Airport and some upgrading of Sydney's roads. The NSW government expects the rail link – a joint public/private venture over four or so years – to cost a total of $730 million. Other infrastructure spending is estimated to be around $400 million. ", " Quantifying the effects of the Olympics itself is difficult, however, since some other activities which might have occurred (including elsewhere in Australia) could have been displaced by Olympics-related work, and some Sydney-based infrastructure investment might have occurred in the absence of the Olympics anyway. ", " While many tourists will come to Australia specifically to view Olympic events, tourism is thought likely to benefit more generally from the publicity Australia receives from hosting the Olympic Games. The Tourism Forecasting Council (TFC) expects that the staging of the Olympics will boost the number of overseas arrivals by around 340,000 over each of the next few years, about 110,000 of which will come solely for the Olympics, and by 1.6 million in total.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> The average foreign tourist in 1998 spent about <span class=\"no-wrap\">$2,100</span> in Australia, suggesting the boost to tourism from the Olympics would add around $700 million a year to <em>tourism revenue</em> over the next three years if the TFC projections were met. ", " The Olympics will also boost other types of service exports. <em>Sponsorship fees</em> received from overseas will be strong in the period leading up to the games, while revenue from <em>broadcast rights</em> (which are worth almost $1 billion) will likely be recorded as exports in the September quarter of 2000. <em>Tickets</em> sold to overseas visitors will also be recorded in September 2000 and, the TFC estimates, will provide an additional boost to service exports of up to $100 million. The overall boost to export receipts in the September quarter will be equivalent to around 1 per cent of GDP and will be associated with a near-commensurate temporary reduction in the current account deficit. ", " <em>Ticket sales</em> to Australians for Olympic events will also be recorded in the September quarter 2000 and are expected by SOCOG to total around $500 million, an amount equivalent to about ½ a per cent of quarterly consumption expenditure. However, the net increase in consumption is likely to be less than this amount as households may curtail expenditure on other forms of entertainment. ", " It is also possible that the staging of the Olympics will boost consumption indirectly by improving consumer sentiment. It is, however, difficult to find much evidence that this has been particularly important at an aggregate level in other countries that have hosted the Olympic Games. In the US, for example, there was no pronounced improvement in consumer sentiment leading up to, or during the Olympic Games held in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Los Angeles</span> and Atlanta. ", " The additional investment activity has contributed to expanded employment in recent years, mainly in the construction industry in NSW. The Olympic Co-ordination Authority (OCA) estimates that approximately <span class=\"no-wrap\">24,000</span> construction jobs are associated with Olympics-related activities over the four years to 1999/00.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> This is equivalent to about 10 per cent of total employment in the NSW building industry, although the net addition to employment over the duration of the construction period may be considerably less than this. Most employment created during the period of the Games itself is likely to be voluntary or temporary in nature, as has been the case in previous Olympic Games. Furthermore, given that the Games only <span class=\"no-wrap\">lasts two weeks</span>, paid employment is likely to rely heavily on overtime hours, and rather less on the creation of new positions. ", " Some other business activities could conceivably be reduced or possibly even shut down for the Olympics period, so that the impact on recorded employment and output is difficult to predict with any accuracy. ", " Despite the large depreciation of the Australian dollar since the middle of 1997, prices for motor vehicles, particularly imported motor vehicles, have continued to decline. That car prices have declined to some extent is not unusual internationally over recent years (Graph D1). What is striking is the extent of the decline in Australia, particularly given the extent of currency depreciation. ", " The fall in prices at the retail level also stands in contrast to the rise of about 14 per cent in the price of imported cars as measured ‘at the docks’ (Table D1). There appear to be both international and domestic forces at work in producing this outcome. In explaining the divergence between dock and retail prices, two factors are probably important: <em>coverage</em> differences and <em>price determination</em>, including <em>discounting</em>, at the domestic level. ", " The CPI <em>coverage</em> of imported motor vehicle prices reflects the objective of measuring prices paid by households, and thus has a relatively high weight on the lower-priced vehicles from Asia, whereas measures of dock prices are intended to cover all imported vehicles, including more expensive European cars. In the past, prices for the two broad groups of cars rose at similar rates so this sampling difference did not drive a wedge between dock and retail price increases. ", " Over recent years, however, Asian car manufacturers have cut their export prices in US dollar terms. This was occurring prior to the onset of the Asian crisis, and has continued since then. Detailed ABS data on import values and volumes by origin measured ‘at the docks’ suggest that the average price of Korean cars fell by 18 per cent, in $A terms, between mid 1997 and March 1999. Over the same period, the average price of cars from the US and Germany rose by around 20 per cent. A higher weight on Korean cars and lower weight on American and German cars in the CPI, compared with measures of dock prices, will thus have contributed to the recorded difference between movements in the two price series. ", " <em>Discounting</em> refers to cash-back offers/ rebates, free accessories and ‘on the road’ features such as extended warranties and free insurance. If the foreign supplier offers discounts to the importer, who in turn passes them on to the consumer, then the dock price, as well as the retail price, is in principle adjusted downwards. However, discounts in the form of free accessories still tend to cause a divergence between movements in dock and retail prices, since the domestic markups forgone on these accessories are typically much greater than those forgone by the foreign supplier. ", " If the exporter offers rebates directly to the consumer, or the importer initiates discounts, then only the retail price is affected and a divergence between movements in dock and retail prices arises. Anecdotal evidence suggests importers are responsible for the bulk of discounts. In particular, Japanese car prices have risen at the docks, but fallen at the retail level. These prices have a substantial weight in the CPI. Consistent with this, the available evidence on profit margins for wholesalers in the motor vehicle industry suggests they have fallen over the past few years. However, these falls may well have been less than that suggested by the fall in retail prices alone; cost cutting appears to have helped prevent too large a fall in overall margins. ", " A number of other explanations have been advanced for the divergence between dock and retail prices. For example, hedging by importers in 1997/98 may have delayed the need to increase prices. It seems likely, however, that hedging contracts of typical length for the industry would have expired some time ago. Reductions in car tariffs, which affect retail but not dock prices, will have contributed to downward pressure on car prices over time, although that appears to be insufficient to explain the emergence of a sharp discrepancy between retail and dock prices over the past year. ", " These explanations of the gap between measured import prices at the docks and those at the retail level still leave, however, the question of why some foreign suppliers have reduced their foreign currency price to Australian distributors and/or consumers. The global oversupply of small, low-priced cars, occasioned at least in part by the expansion of Asian manufacturers in the mid 1990s, is the most likely reason for general downward pressure on car prices. The currency depreciations in Asia have allowed some producers in that region to cut their foreign currency prices more aggressively than producers elsewhere. Both these factors would help to explain why importers, especially those that are linked to foreign suppliers, may have cut their gross margins. The fact that the Australian market is characterised by a much higher degree of importation than the United States – imports make up about half of vehicle sales in Australia, versus less than <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> in the US – also does much to explain the bigger impact of international price cutting here. ", " It is likely, however, that some domestic factors have contributed. Despite price reductions, the share of Asian manufactured cars in the Australian market has barely increased since the middle of 1997. This suggests that domestic manufacturers, with improved productivity resulting from investment in new plant and changed work practices, have been able to compete effectively in the past few years.

Financial markets had stabilised around the region late in January, and by the time of the Bank's <cite><a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1998/may/2.html\">Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</a></cite> in early May, exchange rates and share prices in most of the east Asian economies had recovered a good deal of ground. By June, however, this had given way to another period of pronounced instability, during which most currencies in the east Asian region came under renewed downward pressure, and confidence about economic prospects in the region waned further. ", " The main origin of the financial market movements in mid year was a reassessment of Japan. The Japanese economy had effectively been in recession since the middle of 1997, with the effects of tax increases being amplified by the loss of export sales in Asia, and the corrosive effect of a banking system which had made little progress over several years in overcoming high levels of bad debts. The contraction intensified during the first half of 1998 and, notwithstanding the forthcoming substantial fiscal package, confidence in Japan sank to a very low ebb. In this environment, the yen weakened abruptly and, because Japan is such a large economy in the region, this quickly added to uncertainty about the prospects for recovery in Asia more generally. ", " Australian financial markets, and the Australian economy more generally, were inevitably affected by the events in Asia. The Australian dollar has fallen substantially against the US dollar and the European currencies over the past year, as markets have factored in the effect of the regional turmoil on Australia's export prospects. For much of this period, the Australian dollar has tracked the yen quite closely, despite the very different paths of the Australian and Japanese economies. Australian exports to the east Asian region fell sharply during the December and March quarters – which was the period of most rapid adjustment in the trade accounts of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian countries – but</span> this decline has abated during the June quarter. There has also been some good news in that a number of exporters have been quite successful in finding alternative markets for their products. This has been clearest for resources, where export growth has not slowed at all over the past year. In other cases trade diversion is more difficult. Nonetheless, the decline in the exchange rate can be expected to assist exporters in securing increased market share in US and European markets over the coming year, and there should also be some benefits for those domestic producers competing with imports in the Australian market. ", " Even with this increased flexibility, the international environment remains a very difficult one. Forecasts of world growth have generally been marked down over recent months because of the more widespread recessions in Asia and Japan, and an expected slowing in growth in the US, although the outlook in Europe seems to be improving all the time. Commodity prices remain under downward pressure. ", " In Australia, it is clear that business conditions in parts of the manufacturing sector are very difficult; this is only to be expected given the decline in manufactured exports to the most crisis-prone Asian countries of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 per cent</span> over the past year. The tourism industry will also have been badly affected by the decline in Asian tourism, which has only been partly offset thus far by increases from Europe and the US. Other areas in the domestic economy, however, have continued to expand at a good pace. Construction of both residential and non-residential structures has continued to grow, a trend likely to continue in the short term at least. The services sectors of the economy also are generally expanding. Consumer demand is not growing at the pace seen in the second half of 1997, but that was unlikely to have been sustained anyway. Apart from the loss of export markets, the main effect of all this on the Australian economy has so far been mainly to dampen confidence. Taking that into account, the Bank's assessment is that output is growing at a moderate but below-trend pace, and that this should continue in the period immediately ahead. ", " Inflationary pressures in the economy remain well controlled. The lower exchange rate will in time add to consumer prices, which up to the end of 1997 benefited from the impact of a high currency in 1996. Early indications are, however, that these effects may take a little longer to show up on this occasion than historical experience might suggest. The international prices of many of Australia's imports are steady and, in some important cases, the extremely competitive domestic market may be leading to some compression of profit margins. Vehicle prices are a case in point. Nonetheless, with wholesale import prices having risen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over the past year, some pick-up in consumer prices must be expected. ", " The Bank's central forecast for underlying inflation (based on a broadly unchanged exchange rate) is that it will be about 2 per cent over the year to December 1998. During 1999, it is likely that year-ended inflation rates on this basis will move higher, to around 2½ to 3 per cent. Beyond that period, the inflation result should mainly reflect trends in the domestic cost structure, particularly labour costs. These have slowed over the past year, and wage increases are likely to remain in the 3 to 4 per cent range. ", " There is more than the usual amount of uncertainty about the economic outlook because of the potential for further instability in the economies of Asia, and particularly in their financial markets. Monetary policy has to take this into account as best it can, and balance it against purely domestic factors. At present, monetary policy settings are such as to lend support to domestic demand. Interest rates remain low across the yield curve; credit is freely available and is growing at a solid pace; and the exchange rate is near the low end of historical experience against most countries. In the absence of unforeseen developments, this setting of policy remains appropriate. ", " Events in Asia have continued to be the dominant factor influencing financial markets in Australia in the latest quarter. The Asian crisis moved into a second phase, with the focus shifting away from the emerging east Asian economies to Japan. In fact, financial markets in most of the east Asian economies were on a recovery phase over February, March and April before being unsettled by the deteriorating economic and financial situation in Japan. Most important has been the weakening in the yen, which fell against the US dollar from 133 at end March to a low of 146, before intervention by the US authorities saw it recover sharply (Graph 1). It has since drifted towards its lows again, amid market concerns about implementation lags in the government's new stimulatory measures. Bond yields in Japan fell to 1.125 per cent, equal to the lowest recorded by historians in the past 4,000 years, and well below the level of 1.75 per cent reached by US bonds in the Great Depression (Graph 2). ", " While all countries in the region were affected by these developments, the impact was strongest in countries, including Australia, which had been largely on the periphery of the earlier troubles. Markets seemed to judge that events in Japan would make it harder for these countries to avoid the impact of the turmoil. Some market participants promoted the view that the process would eventually lead to devaluation by China and the breaking of the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar. Not unexpectedly, this saw a great deal of pressure on Hong Kong markets at times. ", " Most of the east Asian economies that were at the centre of the first wave of problems in the second half of 1997 were less affected in this latest phase. In part, this is because their trade and capital accounts had already adjusted sharply. Two of the countries in particular – South Korea and Thailand – weathered the latest regional problems relatively well. Their exchange rates have appreciated in recent months, to the point where the net depreciation since the start of their crisis in mid 1997 has been reduced to about 30 per cent. Short-term interest rates, which had risen to around 25 per cent at the peak of their crisis in December/January, have fallen sharply. In South Korea, they are down to 11 per cent, a little below pre-crisis levels (Graph 3). In Thailand also, rates are around their pre-crisis levels. ", " In contrast, the economic and financial situation in Indonesia has continued to slip, with the forces set in train by the initial collapse of the exchange rate last December/ January proving very destructive in terms of both the political and economic structure. The appointment of a new President and the subsequent announcement of a new agreement with the IMF have not yet produced any marked turnaround; the exchange rate of the rupiah remains around 13,000 to the US dollar, less than 20 per cent of its pre-crisis level, and short-term interest rates have risen to about 60 per cent, broadly in line with the rise in inflation. ", " The one aspect of financial markets in all Asian countries that remains very weak is share markets. Most countries in the region recorded new lows in share prices in the latest quarter, with cumulative falls since the middle of 1997 of about 50 per cent (Graph 4). ", " The economic impact of the regional financial crisis has been seen in some sharp declines in production and substantial adjustments in current account positions. The impact has so far been largest in Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. At the same time, it is becoming clearer that a wider group of countries, which escaped the worst of the earlier financial turbulence, are now experiencing a significant economic impact. ", " For the initial crisis-affected group – the ASEAN-4 and South Korea – the process of macroeconomic adjustment has been necessarily rapid. The abrupt reversal of capital flows to these countries meant that their current account positions had to shift rapidly into surplus. Much of this adjustment took place through lower imports (Graph 5), and was brought about by very large reductions in domestic demand. The size of some of the adjustments has been exceptionally large. Korea's trade position moved by the equivalent of 12 per cent of GDP, and there were similar movements in Thailand and Indonesia. Domestic demand in Korea over the year to March declined by around 28 per cent. ", " In some countries, there are tentative signs that this initial period of rapid adjustment may have largely run its course. Levels of industrial production in Korea and Thailand, having declined by around 15–20 per cent from pre-crisis levels, have been more stable in recent months (Graph 6). Imports are also showing some signs of stabilising, having fallen by more than 30 per cent in both countries. Exports from Korea are now recovering strongly in volume terms, although declining prices mean that, in US dollar terms, they have been flat. In contrast to the experience of these other countries, the latest data for Indonesia point to continued economic contraction. National accounts data record a GDP decline of 17 per cent over the first two quarters of 1998, after a flat performance during the previous year, and imports have continued to fall rapidly. ", " The sharp currency depreciations in these countries have led, in varying degrees, to increased inflation although, in most cases, it remains well contained. In Korea, the impetus to inflation was concentrated around the end of 1997 and the early months of 1998. More recently, consumer prices in Korea have stabilised, probably reflecting the very weak demand conditions and surplus productive capacity in that country. In other countries inflation has come down from recent peaks but continues to run at a higher rate than in the pre-crisis period. The largest increase has taken place in Indonesia, where consumer prices over the year to July rose by around 70 per cent. ", " The wider impact of the crisis on other countries in the region is now starting to be seen more clearly. In Hong Kong, GDP declined in the first quarter of 1998 by more than 4 per cent, following a fall of 1½ per cent in the previous quarter. Singapore has recorded close to zero growth over the past two quarters, and growth in China and Taiwan has slowed appreciably (Graph 7). ", " Several factors are contributing to this more general weakening of regional economies. Declines in asset prices have become widespread across the region, in many cases amplified by the higher interest rates put in place to resist currency depreciations. Another factor is loss of export competitiveness. For China and Hong Kong, which have maintained fixed exchange rates to the US dollar, there has been a significant loss of competitiveness against producers from other countries in the region. This is likely to have contributed to the weakening of their export sales over recent months. To a lesser extent, Singapore and Taiwan have also lost competitiveness in foreign markets, having had smaller currency depreciations than those of the initial crisis-affected group. In addition, the Singaporean economy, which is particularly dependent on intra-regional trade, is being significantly affected by the downturns in Indonesia and Malaysia. The extent and likely duration of this general slowing of regional economies have not yet become clear. Much will depend on developments in Japan, which is by far the region's largest economy. In that regard, recent developments are not encouraging. ", " The Japanese economy continued to weaken in the first half of 1998, prompting the announcement of further policy measures by the Japanese government. National accounts data for the first quarter recorded a fall in GDP of 1.3 per cent, confirming earlier signals of declining demand and output (Graph 8). This result reflected a significant fall in business investment and a decline in exports, following strong export growth in 1997. ", " Most indicators are continuing to point to a difficult environment for Japanese businesses. According to the Bank of Japan's <em>Tankan</em> survey, business confidence deteriorated further in the June quarter, to be at levels below the trough reached in the early 1990s. Unsold inventories are at a high level, and industrial production declined further in the June quarter. Consumer confidence is also at low levels, and unemployment has increased to a post-war high of 4.3 per cent. ", " The deterioration in conditions over the past year has reflected a combination of circumstances including the decline in intra-regional trade, the substantial fiscal policy tightening implemented during 1997, and the poor condition of the Japanese banking system. Weak demand conditions in turn have contributed to declines in inflation from already-low levels. The level of consumer prices was almost unchanged over the six months to June, while wholesale prices over that period declined at an annual rate of around 2 per cent. In these circumstances of weak demand and flat or falling output prices, it is very difficult for businesses to generate increased cash flows. The lack of growth in nominal incomes and spending in the economy, in turn, makes it difficult for businesses and banks to improve their balance sheets and is reinforcing the reluctance of Japanese banks to lend. The volume of bank loans outstanding by Japanese banks has been declining for the past two years. ", " In this environment of declining demand and financial contraction, there have been widespread calls to support growth through fiscal expansion and banking-system restructuring. A fiscal package announced in April contained measures equivalent to around 3 per cent of GDP, aimed at providing a significant boost to domestic demand through tax cuts and new spending. More recently, Prime Minister Obuchi has proposed an additional set of tax cuts to those announced in April. In June, the government announced a restructuring program for the banking system. The restructuring plan involves using a new regulatory agency to assess the viability of all banks, and will provide for the takeover of non-viable banks by publicly funded ‘bridge banks’. It is proposed that these will continue to lend to creditworthy borrowers, assist in the disposal of non-performing assets, and allow the performing assets of failed banks to be transferred to viable institutions. Public funds for the bridge banks are expected to come from the <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>30 trillion already allocated for bank recapitalisation, of which only a small proportion has so far been taken up. ", " Prospects for the Japanese economy will depend heavily on the effectiveness with which this program is implemented. International experience suggests that effective bank recapitalisation is an important condition for any sustained recovery from a banking crisis of these proportions. It also suggests that, even with a well-designed restructuring program in place, progress is likely to be slow. Most observers are expecting output of the Japanese economy to be lower in 1998 than in 1997. ", " Outside the Asian region, the crisis has had both positive and negative effects. The positives are most clearly evident in the United States, where the Asian crisis, by contributing to a stronger US dollar and falling world commodity prices, has helped to cap inflationary forces. This has allowed the US Federal Reserve to sustain lower interest rates and a faster rate of growth in domestic demand than would have been possible otherwise. US bond yields have fallen to around 5.4 per cent, much the same as the cash rate, resulting (unusually for this stage of the economic cycle) in a flat yield curve. The effects on the US share market, on the other hand, have been mixed: there have been some benefits from lower interest rates but the profit results of US companies are increasingly showing signs of adverse impacts from Asian competition. Overall, US share prices have fallen around <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> from recent peaks (Graph 9). ", " The US economy has continued its strong gains in the first half of 1998. Real GDP rose at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> in the first half of the year, supported by robust growth in domestic demand. Consumer spending has been buoyed by expanding job opportunities, increasing real incomes and high levels of wealth. Higher household wealth, combined with low mortgage interest rates, has, in turn, boosted housing demand. Business fixed investment has also been brisk, as firms have taken advantage of conducive financial conditions to expand capacity. ", " While the strength of domestic final demand seems to have continued, the Asian crisis is acting to moderate growth. The combined effects of the appreciation of the dollar and weaker external demand have already seen a sharp increase in the trade deficit, with both a rapid rise in imports and a fall in exports. ", " External factors will continue to reduce growth in the remainder of the year, but it is unclear whether this will be sufficient to forestall inflation risks. The extraordinary tightness in the labour market has intensified in recent months; the unemployment rate, at 4.5 per cent in July, has now been below 5 per cent for the past year and earnings growth has picked up accordingly. So far, however, this has failed to translate into rising consumer price inflation, because the strength of the US dollar and falling prices for raw materials have offset higher labour costs. ", " Economic activity has continued to strengthen in the continental European economies as the emerging recoveries have become more domestically driven. In Germany, real GDP rose strongly in the March quarter, as consumers brought forward expenditure ahead of the April consumption tax increase, and equipment investment rose strongly. Recent retail sales gains suggest the economy has maintained sufficient momentum to weather the tax increase, and there have been signs of recovery in the labour market. In France, real GDP is growing at its fastest pace in three years, with strong employment gains fuelling consumption. The unemployment rate has fallen below 12 per cent for the first time since 1996. ", " In the United Kingdom, growth in domestic demand remains strong, but is being partly offset by falling net exports, reflecting the appreciation of the pound over the past two years. The Bank of England raised short-term interest rates by 25 basis points in June to 7½ per cent, citing mounting labour market pressures and an inflation rate above target as key concerns. ", " The gathering pace of economic expansion is one reason that European markets have been least affected by Asia, with share markets in particular remaining stronger than elsewhere. Europe has also been more preoccupied by the decision on the group of countries to join the Euro in 1999. The 11 countries joining are (in order of GDP size) Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Finland, Portugal, Ireland and Luxembourg. ", " The most visible impact from Asia on Australian financial markets has been the fall in the Australian dollar. It is down from around US75 cents in mid 1997 to about US60 cents at present (Graph 10). This fall has taken place in two phases, in line with the two phases of the Asian crisis. The first reflected mainly the events in east Asia, culminating in the sharp depreciation of the Australian dollar in late 1997/early January, to around US63 cents. It recovered from there to around US68 cents by early April, but then fell to a low of US58 cents in June on the back of events in Japan. ", " Through most of this period the Bank did not intervene in the market, recognising the underlying economic factors at work and the close connection with events in Asia. In fact, throughout this period, the Australian dollar, in common with many other currencies in the region, showed a remarkable tendency to move very closely with the yen (see <a href=\"#box\">Box</a>). ", " In early June, however, the Australian dollar's fall accelerated, causing it to decline even against the yen, which was itself falling sharply. Two main factors were responsible. First, participants in the market began to believe that the Australian authorities were happy to see the dollar continue to fall. Second, and perhaps related to these developments, hedge funds stepped up their profile in the market. This caused a reduction in market liquidity, as other market players were unwilling to trade on a normal two-way basis while these funds were selling aggressively. ", " Against this background, the Reserve Bank intervened in the market, buying $2.6 billion dollars in local currency during June. The Bank's presence acted as a counterweight to the hedge funds and restored a normal two-way flow of business although, on balance, the exchange rate continued to fall, eventually reaching a low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">US58.1 cents</span>. The turning point in the market came with the intervention by the US Federal Reserve to support the yen exchange rate; this caused a sharp rise in the yen and the Australian dollar moved up with it. Subsequently, the Australian dollar continued to recover, even though the yen steadied, as earlier sellers turned some of their positions. By end June, the Australian dollar was around US62 cents, a level it remained at or above during most of July, before falling to around US60 cents in early August as the yen weakened again. ", " The weakness in the exchange rate in June led to a reappraisal within financial markets about the outlook for monetary policy. This was most clearly reflected in short-term interest rates, which, for much of the first half of 1998, had continued to factor in some possibility of an easing in monetary policy. The heightened pressure on the exchange rate in early June saw the yield on 90-day bills, which had been a little below the cash rate, rise sharply at one stage to 5.8 per cent. This level implied a strong market expectation that monetary policy would be tightened. As the exchange rate subsequently moved from its lows, 90-day bill yields returned gradually to around 5.1 per cent (Graph 11). ", " Money markets in Australia were also affected in the  June quarter by the introduction of real-time gross  settlement (RTGS) for interbank payments in Australia,  which resulted in a temporary rise in banks' demand  for liquid funds. This saw the cash rate move above  its target of 5 per cent for a time, and the yield on  Treasury Notes, which are eligible for purchase by the  Reserve Bank in the course of its market operations,  move to <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 basis points</span> below that for bank bills (from normally about 10 basis points below). As banks grew more accustomed to operating under RTGS, these pressures subsided. ", " The pressures on market yields arising from the fall in the exchange rate were less apparent in the bond market than in short-term yields, although bond yields did rise to some extent in June. This rise partly reversed earlier declines, which had reflected a number of factors: the expected negative impact of the Asian situation on the local economy, associated concerns about the possibility of global deflation, and the projected fall in the stock of bonds on issue reflecting the expected run of Budget surpluses and the proposed sale of the remainder of Telstra. After reaching a low of 5.3 per cent in early June, the yield on 10-year bonds rose to 5.8 per cent by mid June, then moved back to around 5.5 per cent subsequently (Graph 12). ", " At their low point in early June, bond yields in Australia were below yields in the United States, but the rise in yields associated with the fall in the exchange rate again lifted them above US yields. In early August, the margin of 10-year bonds in Australia over 10-year US Treasuries was about 20 basis points, still well below the historical norm. The rise in Australian short-term interest rates relative to those in the United States was more pronounced, but has now been largely reversed. ", " The Australian share market has been volatile in recent months. After rising quite strongly in the first four months of 1998, in line with the lift in world share markets generally, it fell by over 10 per cent by mid June. The main factors underlying this fall were renewed pessimism about Asia, due to the problems being experienced by Japan, and the turn in expectations about interest rates in Australia following the fall in the exchange rate. Subsequently, calmer conditions returned in Australia, and helped by the US market reaching new highs in July, Australian share prices recovered. The rise, however, was narrowly based, being attributable mainly to share prices of a small number of large companies. Subsequent weakness in world share markets over late July and early August, reflecting renewed concerns about Asian markets, saw share prices in Australia return to close to their June lows. Prices of resource stocks have been weaker than average, as markets have judged that prospects for profits of resources companies have been particularly weakened by the malaise in Asia. The index of share prices in the resources sector has fallen by 18 per cent since April, compared with a fall in the <em>All Industrials</em> of 2 per cent. ", " Growth in output of the Australian economy is now slowing from the solid pace recorded during 1997 and into the early part of 1998. Over the year to the March quarter, real output increased by a little under 5 per cent, and growth in the non-farm economy was somewhat stronger than that. There have been a number of signs that the economy is now easing back to a more moderate pace of growth. According to the national accounts, there was a sharp slowing in private spending in the March quarter, while an unusually large volume of output in the quarter was absorbed by stockbuilding (Table 1). Although more recent indicators suggest that the slowing of private spending depicted in the accounts is exaggerated, the indicators generally confirm the economy's transition from above-trend to below-trend rates of growth. The labour market, meanwhile, continues to benefit from the economy's strong performance over 1997 and early 1998, and unemployment remains below the levels of a year ago. ", " A sharp turnaround in the external sector, evident in weakening export volumes and declining commodity prices, has been the major dampening influence on growth. As noted above, the contractionary impulse arising from the Asian crisis has occurred in two stages – an initial, rapid contraction in the economies first affected by the regional financial instability, and a more delayed slowing of other economies in the region. Much of the impact on Australia's exports to the first group of countries has probably now taken place, and there is evidence of a growing diversification of exports to other destinations. However, the more recent downturns in other regional economies, and particularly Japan, will have some further dampening influence. The deteriorating external situation has also had an adverse impact on business and consumer confidence. The Australian economy is likely to experience a period of below-trend growth while these factors remain in place. ", " Retail spending showed a small decline in real terms in the June quarter, to be 2.8 per cent higher than a year ago. Over the first half of 1998 retail trade has shown almost no net increase in real terms, following the strong growth recorded in the second half of 1997. The result for the month of June, a fall of 0.8 per cent, incorporates a substantial decline in spending in department stores; this may partly reflect recent changes to the timing of mid-year sales, as there was a similar fall recorded the previous June, followed by a strong bounce-back the next month (Graph 13). ", " Sales of motor vehicles have again posted some very rapid growth, after easing back a little in the early part of 1998. In June, motor vehicle registrations jumped by 17 per cent; this occurred alongside a rise of 22 per cent in car imports in the month. The renewed growth in sales has been supported by further discounting by retailers and reductions in imported car prices. For 1997/98 as a whole, passenger vehicle registrations were, at <span class=\"no-wrap\">over 650,000</span>, the highest on record. It is possible that the increases in car sales occurring at present, by absorbing a higher proportion of disposable incomes, are having a dampening effect on sales of other durable goods. ", " Consumer sentiment, according to the Melbourne Institute survey, declined through the first half of 1998, although it remains above long-run average levels. Consumers appear to be becoming more concerned about the outlook for the economy and the outlook for unemployment (Graph 14). Their responses are clearly sensitive to the news which is released around the time the survey is being taken but, in broad terms, appear to reflect the likelihood that the economy will grow more slowly in 1998 than it did in 1997. In contrast to sentiment about the economy as a whole, there has been little decline in measures of consumers' perceptions of their own financial situation, which remain well above longer-term averages. ", " One factor which should help underpin consumer spending in the latter half of 1998 is the AMP demutualisation. Insofar as policyholders perceive their allocation of shares as amounting to a windfall gain, they are likely to use a proportion of the proceeds from the demutualisation to boost spending. With the market price of AMP shares towards the top end of earlier expectations, the addition to household wealth will be somewhat larger than was initially estimated. To some extent, however, the effect on spending may be dampened by current consumer concerns about the outlook for the domestic economy, particularly given that household saving has been declining recently. On balance, our earlier estimate that the demutualisation would boost consumer spending by a few tenths of a per cent of GDP remains plausible (for further details, see the May 1998 <em>Semi-Annual Statement</em>, <span class=\"no-wrap\"><a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1998/may/2.html#box-b\">Box B</a>)</span>. ", " Housing construction activity has increased strongly over the past 18 months, supported by high levels of affordability. In the March quarter, the number of housing commencements was 10.1 per cent higher than a year earlier, and building approvals data point to a further solid increase in the June quarter. Growth in activity has been boosted by continued increases in the value of the average new dwelling constructed, and by strong growth in spending on alterations and additions. ", " Notwithstanding this recent strength, the likely extent of future expansion in the current housing upswing is difficult to gauge, with forward indicators of housing demand giving conflicting signals. After increasing strongly during much of 1997, loan approvals for housing appeared to level out in the early months of this year, before showing a strong further rise in June (Graph 15). The increase in loan approvals in June may have partly reflected efforts by borrowers to take advantage of existing low interest rates, amidst widespread talk that intermediaries' interest rates might rise. These concerns may have brought forward some demand for loans, as well as encouraging a strong increase in refinancing as borrowers shifted from floating to fixed-rate loans. As discussed in detail in the section on Financial Conditions below, there were some small increases in fixed housing loan rates, which reflected increased funding costs in financial markets. ", " Local government building approvals, meanwhile, have continued on a strong upward trend, with growth in the alterations and additions component particularly pronounced. The normal pattern is that trends in housing finance lead those in building approvals, and so it would be unusual for the current strong growth in building approvals to continue without some renewed growth in finance. A plausible interpretation of these trends is that the housing upswing may be maturing, particularly given that the rate of new construction is approaching a level somewhere near the trend rate of expansion in demand for new housing. This would also be consistent with other evidence that demand conditions in the market for existing housing are now easing a little in some areas. ", " Recent trends in house prices are pointing to an easing of excess demand in those areas where it had initially been concentrated, particularly in the inner suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. After a period of rapid growth during 1997, house-price increases in these inner city areas have eased considerably in recent months. More moderate upward pressures on prices are now working their way across a wider area in the middle and outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as becoming evident in a number of the other capital cities. Available indicators of rental rates and vacancies of residential property are volatile and vary considerably across capital cities but, in general, they provide tentative signs of a mild easing of growth in rents; vacancy rates have picked up a little in some cities, but they remain low. Together, the trends in house prices, rents and vacancies provide little evidence of a significant build-up of either excess demand or excess supply in the housing market at present. Conditions would seem supportive of continued, although somewhat more moderate, growth in housing investment in the period ahead. Given the low level of interest rates, spending on alterations and additions seems likely to remain strong. ", " Production increased strongly in the March quarter following good growth through 1997. A significant part of the March quarter increase in output, however, was recorded as being absorbed in unsold stocks, and the interpretation of this result has an important bearing on the business outlook for later in the year. Some increase in stocks in the March quarter was expected as, according to the national accounts, stocks had been run down over 1997, and surveys had been pointing to a desire by businesses to re-build stocks. A detailed examination of <span class=\"no-wrap\">stocks-to-sales</span> ratios at an industry level shows that the increase in stocks in the March quarter largely returned these ratios to around their average levels of recent periods (Graph 16). It is also possible that the large estimate for stockbuilding will be subject to revision – the pattern over the 1990s has been that unusually large initial estimates of the change in stocks have tended to be revised to show less extreme movements. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the increase in stocks in the quarter is, at least in part, suggestive of some unintended stockbuilding having taken place. ", " Business surveys have pointed to weaker conditions in the June and September quarters. This appears to be mainly linked to the ongoing crisis in Asia, which has had a large direct effect on export sales and has reduced business confidence. Almost two-thirds of respondents to the NAB Survey of non-farm businesses expect their firms to be affected by developments in the Asian region in the next 12 months. Averaged across all respondents, total sales are expected to be 2 per cent lower than they would otherwise have been on account of developments in Asia. Business confidence, as recorded in the June quarter NAB survey, has declined to a level slightly below the most recent trough reached in March 1996. The decline in this measure of business confidence has, however, been somewhat more marked than the declines in indicators of firms' employment and capital expenditure plans recorded in the same survey (Graph 17). In this respect, there is a parallel with consumer survey results, which suggest that consumers are more pessimistic about the economy as a whole than about their own circumstances. Other business surveys are more pessimistic, particularly those relating specifically to the manufacturing sector such as the ACCI-Westpac and Colonial State Bank surveys. ", " The greater deterioration in confidence in the manufacturing sector is likely to reflect that sector's relatively high exposure to international trade and the loss of export sales to the east Asian region. Employment and profitability in manufacturing have been weaker than in other industries over the past year, with employment recording a decline. As discussed in detail in the section on Balance of Payments below, manufacturing is likely to be one of the areas in which exporters have greatest difficulty in the short term in diversifying into alternative markets to compensate for reduced sales in Asia. The manufacturing-based surveys have been pointing to significant declines in export sales, and balance of payments data confirm the weakness in manufacturing exports over much of the past year, although they picked up in the June quarter. The surveys also suggest a significant decline in manufacturers' investment intentions (generally presenting a more pessimistic outlook in this regard than the ABS capital expenditure survey, discussed below). ", " Total profitability of the corporate sector, as measured by gross operating surplus, has been gradually declining as a share of GDP since the peak reached in 1996, and is now, at 15 per cent, around its decade average. The recent depreciation of the Australian dollar and consequent increase in Australian-dollar commodity prices would generally imply an increase in profits for mining companies. However, many large companies had hedged the $A/US$ rate prior to the exchange-rate decline, and hence will not receive any boost to profits, at least in the short term. In addition, some companies have a natural hedge, earning most of their income in US dollars but also incurring a high proportion of their costs in US dollars. Therefore, benefits to these companies may also be smaller than in other cases. ", " If the recent deterioration in business sentiment is to have a significant effect on real activity, it would do so by altering firms' investment and employment plans. Over the past five years, investment expenditure on equipment has grown very strongly. Recent data, however, suggest some reduction in the pace of growth. Estimates from the latest ABS capital expenditure survey for 1997/98 suggest real growth (in annually chained terms) of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> over the year to the June quarter, compared with 10 per cent over the preceding year. Estimates for 1998/99 are pointing to a subdued outlook for this type of investment. Based on average realisation ratios, the survey would imply only moderate growth in nominal terms for the year, and roughly flat equipment investment in real terms. This expectation, recorded in the survey conducted in late April and early May, represents a downward revision to the previous outlook recorded three months earlier. Within the total, expectations in the manufacturing sector have been revised upward, although this was from a low level and, as noted above, the manufacturing-based business surveys continue to give a very pessimistic reading. ", " In contrast to these expectations for investment in equipment, the capital expenditure survey points to a stronger outlook for investment in buildings and structures. This impression is supported by a recent pick-up in private non-residential building approvals. While non-residential approvals are extremely volatile, they have been quite strong in the June quarter, regaining levels recorded in the latter part of 1997 (Graph 18). If sustained, this recent strength in approvals would support reasonably firm growth in construction activity over 1998/99. It also appears that there is quite a large stock of work yet-to-be-done, which should also help underpin further growth in construction activity. This is the case both for non-residential buildings and for engineering construction projects, such as private-sector infrastructure developments. ", " Non-residential construction work is typically very lumpy, and the recent increase in commencements has been concentrated mainly in office, hotel and recreational projects. According to the latest Access Economics Property Monitor, office and hotel projects currently under construction and under consideration are heavily concentrated in New South Wales, although other types of project are more evenly spread geographically. This pattern appears broadly consistent with information on office rents and vacancy rates, which suggest that demand for office space is stronger in New South Wales than elsewhere. The concentration of hotel projects in Sydney, in particular, largely reflects projects which are driven by the expected increase in tourism associated with the Olympic Games. The Property Monitor gives little evidence so far of construction projects being cancelled in the wake of recent declines in business confidence. Between the March and June surveys, plans for only one large development were placed on hold and only a couple of projects were downgraded; the stock of projects under consideration in June remained around the level of a year ago. ", " Over the past few years, private-sector businesses have funded relatively more of their activities in the form of debt finance. This has been reflected in an increasing ratio of corporate debt to equity. More recently the rate of growth of corporate borrowing from domestic financial institutions has declined, and in the March quarter corporates retired a large sum of foreign debt. Coupled with ongoing equity raisings, this reduced the overall debt to equity ratio in the March quarter. This reversal of the upward trend in corporate leverage may prove to be temporary, however, with a number of large companies recently undertaking share buy-backs. ", " Employment has continued to post solid gains in recent months, following the strong growth in output over 1997 and into the early months of 1998. In July, the level of employment stood slightly more than 2 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 19). Full-time employment has been increasing at around the same rate as the total over the past year, recovering from an earlier period of around 18 months without growth. Much of the growth in employment over the past year has been in private-sector service industries, particularly in property and business services, while there have been declines in employment in manufacturing and the public sector. The stronger labour market conditions overall have been reflected in a fall in the unemployment rate over the past year. In July, the unemployment rate was 8.3 per cent, compared with 8.7 per cent a year earlier. ", " Labour productivity has continued to grow rapidly. According to the latest national accounts, labour productivity per hour worked over the year to the March quarter 1998 was exceptionally strong, increasing by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. To some extent this result was boosted by differences in timing between the recent increases in output and employment growth, with the pick-up in output growth preceding that in employment (see below); it also appears to be based on implausibly low estimates of the increase in hours worked. Even allowing for these factors, however, it is clear that rapid productivity growth remains an important feature of the current period of economic expansion. Since the start of the economic recovery in 1991, annual productivity growth has averaged just under 2 per cent. ", " Short-term fluctuations in the rate of employment growth have typically lagged behind those in aggregate output (Graph 20). In broad terms, the recent trends in employment have continued that pattern, with the stronger employment growth that started in the second half of 1997 coming somewhat later than the initial pick-up in output growth. Although the relationship between these two variables is not precise, past behaviour would suggest some additional impetus to employment still to come from the economy's recent strength, before the current slowing in output growth begins to affect the labour market. However, the unknown factor in the present outlook is the extent to which businesses may adjust their hiring plans in light of their more pessimistic assessments of economic prospects. It is possible that, given the publicity surrounding developments in Asia and their adverse effect on confidence, businesses may be somewhat more cautious in their hiring plans than would normally be expected following a strong period of economic growth. ", " Indicators of prospective labour demand are providing mixed signals at present. According to the NAB business survey, there has been a moderate decline in firms' near-term hiring intentions over the past six months, occurring alongside the more general deterioration in business confidence. Vacancies indicators, however, offer a stronger picture (Graph 21). Both the ANZ job-ads series and the DEETYA Skilled Vacancy Index continue to rise, and are respectively 15 and 22 per cent higher than a year ago. Even stronger growth has been recorded in the ABS vacancies series, which has risen by 28 per cent over the past year, the bulk of this in the past two quarters. ", " The impact of the economic problems in the Asian region are now clearly evident in Australia's external accounts. These events have contributed to a decline in the volume of exports, a fall in Australia's terms of trade and a widening of the current account deficit. Growth in imports remained quite strong in the first half of 1998, showing a sharp increase in June after a few months when they had appeared to be levelling out. ", " After growing solidly through much of 1997, the volume of exports of goods and services fell by 0.8 per cent in the December quarter and by a further 1.7 per cent in the March quarter, after adjusting for RBA gold transactions. In an underlying sense, the slowing in export growth was probably even more marked, as exports of non-official gold were unusually strong in these two quarters, reflecting the re-export of gold imports from a number of the east Asian countries. The observed weakening in export growth reflected both the direct effect of weakness in demand from the Asian region and the effect of lower farm production. Reasonably solid growth in export volumes appears to have occurred in the June quarter. ", " Exports of services and manufactures have been the areas most adversely affected by developments in the east Asian region. After falling by nearly 8 per cent in the December quarter, the volume of services exports was flat in the March quarter, and appears to have risen marginally in the June quarter. Manufactured exports fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> in the second half of 1997 and by a further 4 per cent in the March quarter, but appear to have rebounded in the June quarter. The export of several ferries boosted the June quarter growth but, even excluding these, manufactured exports probably increased by over 3 per cent in the quarter. ", " Tables 2 and 3 provide an overview of these developments at a regional level. They show that over the year to the June quarter, the value of manufactured exports to east Asia fell by around 15 per cent, while overseas arrivals from east Asia (a good indicator of tourist trade) fell by around 10 per cent. Developments in east Asian markets have thus had a significant impact on total exports of manufactures and services from Australia. These tables also illustrate, however, that exporters have made some gains in sales to other countries; over the past year, growth in exports of manufactures and services to many countries outside the Asian region have been stronger than trend growth rates recorded earlier in the 1990s. ", " A sharp weakening in rural exports in the December and March quarters also contributed to the weakening in total export growth. Rural exports fell by over 10 per cent in the March quarter, after having fallen by nearly 4 per cent in the December quarter, and they appear to have been broadly flat in the June quarter. This weakness can be explained largely by a decline in farm production from unusually high levels in 1996/97. Weakness in demand in the Asian countries has also contributed to the weakening in rural exports, as exports of some commodities, such as live cattle and wool, have been particularly concentrated in Asia. In general, however, exporters of many rural goods have been able to find alternative markets for their products to compensate for the loss in demand from Asia. ", " This diversion has been particularly clear in the case of resources (Graph 22). These relatively homogenous commodities are typically sold into world markets. The available data suggest that lost sales into Asia have been completely offset by increased sales elsewhere, particularly in Europe. As a result, growth in resource export volumes (excluding gold) over the year to June was around 6 per cent, the same as over the preceding <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 months</span>, and close to the average rate of growth in the 1990s. ", " Volatility in the export data, combined with a lack of information about country-specific price developments, imply that month-by-month developments have to be interpreted with care. However, tentative signs are emerging that the worst of the direct effect on Australia of the contraction in demand in South Korea and the ASEAN countries may have already passed. Exports to these countries appear to have stabilised in recent months (albeit at much-reduced levels), while exports to other regions outside Asia have continued to pick up, reflecting both solid demand and improvements in the competitive position of Australian exporters (Graph 23). ", " Import demand has remained quite strong in the first half of 1998 although, prior to the sharp increase recorded in June, nominal spending on imports had appeared to be easing. A big part of the latest rise was accounted for by motor vehicles, but there was also significant growth in imports of intermediate goods. The recent strength of imports supports the assessment that domestic demand continues to expand at a reasonable pace. There is little evidence of a widespread acceleration in imports from the troubled Asian economies, although there have been significant increases in certain categories, notably motor vehicles, gold and jewellery – the latter two probably destined for re-export. Overseas departures to many of the troubled Asian economies have also picked up markedly over the past year. ", " The net effect of these external developments has been to increase the size of the current account deficit (Graph 24). In the March quarter, the current account deficit was 5.4 per cent of GDP, driven largely by a widening in the trade deficit to 1.8 per cent of GDP. In the June quarter, the trade deficit has declined a little, and the current account deficit may have also declined, depending on the size of the net income deficit. ", " It is notable that the exchange rate depreciation has had little valuation effect on the net income deficit. A bit more than half of the gross external debt is denominated in foreign currencies. It, and the foreign currency debt servicing payments, are therefore subject to valuation effects when the exchange rate changes; currency depreciation increases the debt-servicing costs in Australian dollar terms. However, the effect this has on the net income deficit is being roughly offset by the corresponding valuation impact on foreign assets, since these are of similar magnitude to the foreign-currency-denominated component of external debt. In the March quarter, valuation effects meant that the net income deficit actually narrowed slightly, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">$5.0 billion</span> (3.6 per cent of GDP). ", " Net foreign liabilities rose in the March quarter, with a $6.9 billion increase taking the stock of net foreign liabilities to $323.0 billion (59.9 per cent of GDP); net foreign debt now stands at $224.5 billion (41.6 per cent of GDP). The ratio of income payments to exports remains near its average over the past two decades, at 17.9 per cent. ", " After stabilising in the early months of 1998, commodity prices weakened during the June quarter as evidence emerged of a further deterioration in demand in Asia. In US dollar terms, Australia's commodity prices are now around 18 per cent below the peak recorded in the early months of 1997, prior to the onset of the Asian crisis. In SDR terms, the decline has been about 15 per cent (Graph 25). These price falls have been spread across most components, but have continued to be most pronounced for base metals and rural goods. Contract prices of bulk commodities have so far been unaffected by significant price falls, but spot prices have now fallen well below these contract prices in some cases. ", " The further recent weakening in the outlook for Asia, particularly outside the initial crisis-affected group, appears to have specifically affected the outlook for wool and base metals. Wool prices have continued to fall sharply, and are now 18.5 per cent below levels of a year ago in Australian dollar terms, inducing some wool producers to switch to prime lamb production. The weakening in base metals prices in recent months has been driven by concern over falling demand in Asia, particularly in Japan. ", " Influences other than the Asian events also appear to be having a dampening effect on some commodity prices. Oil prices, although fairly stable for the past couple of months, remain nearly 30 per cent lower than levels of a year ago in US dollar terms because of high production levels. In March, members of OPEC agreed to cut production by around 2.6 million barrels a day in order to support prices. Falling wheat prices in recent months mostly reflect increases in world stock levels; stocks have increased over the past year due to the combination of good harvests in many regions and weaker world demand. ", " Despite the continued weakness in commodity markets, the further decline in the Australian dollar against the major international currencies has meant that, in domestic-currency terms, commodity prices have remained roughly stable in recent months. They are slightly above their average level of the past five years or so. ", " With the Reserve Bank's cash rate target unchanged since July 1997, there have been few changes in interest rates on variable-rate loans in recent months. However, recent volatility in capital market yields has caused some financial intermediaries to adjust rates on fixed-rate loans. ", " Banks announced increases in June of up to 35 basis points in the interest rate on three-year fixed-rate housing loans, taking this rate to 6.85 per cent. Even so, this rate remains 1.9 percentage points under the previous cyclical low early in 1994, reflecting the trend decline in bond yields over recent years. With fixed-rate loans at historical lows, and markets focusing on the possibility of higher interest rates, the proportion of fixed-rate borrowers rose to around 25 per cent in June, compared to 15 per cent in the previous month. ", " Interest rates on variable-rate loans, which tend to be priced from the cash rate, have not changed in recent months. Indicator rates on standard variable-rate housing loans from banks remain around 6.7 per cent, where they have been since August 1997, while variable lending rates of mortgage managers are 40 basis points lower at 6.3 per cent. This period of stability in housing interest rates suggests that the period of intense competition in the housing market, driven by mortgage managers' quest to raise market share, has run its course, at least for the time being. ", " Rates charged on small business fixed-rate loans also rose in June, although some of this was reversed in July. The average indicator rate on three-year fixed-rate loans to small business is up by a net 20 basis points, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.2 per cent</span>, over the two months. ", " Perhaps of more significance, competition in small business finance has intensified over the past year, as banks have reduced indicator rates on variable-rate loans on mainstream lending products and offered products with risk margins linked closely to the type of security that borrowers offer. The average indicator rate for overdrafts fell by about one percentage point over March and April, to 7.7 per cent, even though there was no change in monetary policy. The predominant indicator rates on term loans and overdrafts secured by residential property are 6.9 and 7.2 per cent respectively. These rates are the lowest for ‘widely available’ small business products since the mid 1960s (Graph 26). ", " In the March quarter, the average interest rate on small business variable-rate loans, incorporating customer risk margins, was 9.4 per cent. These figures do not yet capture the latest reductions in small business indicator rates, which were announced late in March and early in April. Banks' margins on small business lending, which have narrowed since mid 1997, might narrow further in figures for the June quarter and beyond as recent reductions in indicator rates begin to affect the figures. ", " While there has been no widespread move to lower indicator rates on variable-rate loans for large business, two banks also reduced these rates when they announced reductions in small business rates. While the average indicator rate on large business variable-rate loans, at 8.0 per cent, is now higher than the corresponding rate for small businesses, the all-up borrowing cost to large business remains lower than for small businesses since customer risk margins for the former are, on average, finer than those for the latter. This is evident in the average interest rate paid by large businesses for variable-rate loans, which was 7.9 per cent in March 1998. ", " Some signs of competition among banks for personal lending have also become evident, especially for secured and unsecured fixed-rate personal instalment loans. In recent months, the interest rate on secured fixed-rate personal loans has been reduced by 2.1 percentage points to 9.9 per cent, and that for unsecured fixed-rate loans has fallen by 1.2 percentage points to 11.1 per cent. There has been no change to interest rates generally either on variable-rate personal loans or credit cards since September 1997, following the last easing in monetary policy. Some banks have made some special offers available on credit cards to new customers. ", " With the growing competition in lending markets, banks' interest spreads have narrowed.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> In the period of financial deregulation in Australia, dating from the early 1980s, the average spread of major banks has declined from about 5.0 per cent to 3.2 per cent in 1998. The gap that emerged in the early 1990s between the spread on performing assets and that on total assets reflected the impact of banks' bad loans on profits in that period. The high level of bad loans worked to reduce the overall spread, while banks sought to compensate by increasing the spread on performing loans. After a period of adjustment in 1993 and 1994, a clear downward trend in both measures of spread resumed (Graph 27). ", " The downward trend in recent years reflects a larger fall in the average interest rate received by banks than in the average interest rate paid. The former effect reflects the narrowing of margins on housing and small business loans: the rate on standard variable rate housing loans has fallen by 1.3 percentage points more than the cash rate since mid 1996; in 1998, the average variable-rate on small business loans has fallen by 0.7 of a percentage point relative to the cash rate. Banks' cost of funds has fallen by less than the reduction in the overnight cash rate, in part, because rates paid by banks on some deposits, particularly transaction accounts, were already low during the recent phase of easing in monetary policy and could not be reduced <em lang=\"la\">pari passu</em> with the cash rate. ", " Total credit provided to the private sector by financial intermediaries grew at an annual rate of 9.6 per cent over the six months to June (Table 4). While still a robust rate of increase in an economy in which nominal incomes are growing at around 6 per cent, this represents a moderate slowdown in the pace of financial intermediation from rates recorded in the second half of last year. Within the total, credit to households has picked up slightly, while the rate of expansion of business credit has declined. After the strong pick-up seen in the second half of 1997, business credit is now growing at a more moderate pace. ", " The growth in housing credit outstanding reflects the net effect of new lending and loan repayments. The increases in new loan approvals recorded through most of 1997 did not lead to an increased rate of growth in loans outstanding, because principal repayments were increasing at the same time. Households were responding to declining interest rates by paying off their loans more quickly rather than reducing loan payments. In recent months, as discussed in the section on Domestic Economic Activity above, housing loan approvals have stabilised after the strong growth recorded earlier, but they remain at a high enough level to generate continued strong growth in the value of loans outstanding. ", " Following a period of weakness, growth in the broader deposit-based aggregates, M3 and broad money, has picked up in the past few months. The increase in broad-money growth, to an annualised rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> over the six months to June, brings it more into line with the growth in credit. This followed a period in the second half of 1997 when banks had been funding a significant part of their credit expansion from other sources, principally offshore borrowing and a reduction in holdings of government securities. Growth in currency over the six months to June was marginally lower than over the previous six months, and, on the most recent figures, appears to have eased a little further, possibly reflecting moderation in the growth of consumer spending. ", " Funds under management grew strongly in the March quarter, to continue the trend seen over the past three years. There is little evidence of this trend slowing in the near term. Over the year to the March quarter, growth in total assets of managed funds has been strongest in the cash management and public unit trust sectors <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 5)</span>. Assets of equity trusts have grown particularly strongly, to be up by 8 per cent in the March quarter and by nearly 40 per cent over the year. Underpinned by mandatory contributions, assets managed by superannuation funds continue to grow strongly. Valuation effects have contributed around half of the asset growth over the past year in life offices and superannuation funds. Funds managed by friendly societies continue to contract. ", " The growth of funds under management in recent years has been encouraged by the high average rates of return yielded by these investments relative to those that can be earned on traditional savings vehicles. While the volume of bank fixed deposits has been little changed over the past 18 months, funds under management have increased by $94 billion. The search for higher returns has also resulted in a sharp increase in direct investment in the share market by households. A recent survey by the Australian Stock Exchange found that around <span class=\"no-wrap\">29 per cent</span> of the adult population directly owned shares, up from 16 per cent four years ago and 9 per cent a decade ago. This proportion will increase further following the strong retail exposure to the <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>United Energy, AMP</em> and <em>NSW TAB</em></span> floats subsequent to the survey. Reflecting this change, household income derived from dividends has almost doubled over the past four years. ", " While household saving rates have been fairly stable throughout the 1990s, household assets and liabilities have expanded rapidly, increasing as a proportion of household disposable income. This accumulation in assets and liabilities has seen marked changes in the composition of household balance sheets. As households have simultaneously increased their debt levels and equity holdings, they are now much more exposed to changes in interest rates and equity prices than has been the case in previous cycles. ", " Despite the increasing exposure to financial markets, household sector balance sheets remain strong, with their aggregate net financial assets rising by around 14 per cent over the year to the March quarter 1998. In the March quarter, households' liquid financial assets (excluding superannuation) were around 125 per cent of household disposable income, comfortably exceeding their financial liabilities, which were around 100 per cent of household disposable income. The ratio of total household debt to the value of the housing stock has, until recently, been increasing, but remains a little below the peak of the late 1980s (Graph 28). In the past year, house price increases have reduced this ratio somewhat, suggesting that there remains a substantial reserve of housing equity acting as collateral on bank loans. Of course, these aggregate indicators hide some significant dispersion in the pattern of asset and liability holdings across households. Certain categories of households, notably recent home-buyers, will have considerably greater debt exposures than the average. ", " Inflation remains low and has risen only marginally from the trough it reached at the end of 1997. In underlying terms, consumer prices rose by 0.4 per cent in the June quarter to be 1.6 per cent higher over the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 29)</span>. At a quarterly rate, the increases in the March and June quarters (0.5 and 0.4 per cent) show a small pick-up after a succession of increases of 0.3 per cent in 1997. The small increase in inflation in the past two quarters mainly reflects the withdrawal of the earlier disinflationary impact from declining import prices. As discussed below, the recent currency depreciation can be expected in time to give a significant boost to import prices at the retail level, but the main impact has yet to flow through. ", " In headline terms, consumer prices rose by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter to be 0.7 per cent higher than a year earlier. The increase over the past year has continued to be held down by declines in mortgage interest charges, the last of which occurred in the September quarter 1997. With housing interest rates having been broadly stable since then, the quarterly increases for the CPI and the underlying measure have subsequently moved closer together. From the September quarter 1998, the Australian Statistician will introduce the 13th Series CPI, which makes a number of changes to the scope and coverage of the index. From a practical point of view, the most important change is the adoption of an ‘acquisitions’ approach to the measurement of housing costs, which will have the effect of removing mortgage interest rates from the index. ", " The rate of increase in private-sector service prices is currently running at just over 3 per cent, while prices of domestically produced goods increased by around one per cent over the past year, having slowed significantly during the past two years. After two years of almost continuous declines, import prices at the retail level showed little net movement over the March and June quarters, although they remain below their level of a year earlier. ", " The decline in the exchange rate over the past year has had an important impact on import prices at the wholesale level that will eventually flow through to retail prices. At the docks, import prices have increased by around 10 per cent over the four quarters to June. To date, this has had little effect on retail prices. There was a noticeable increase in the imported-goods component of the CPI in the March quarter, but in the June quarter this movement was reversed. Much of this rise and subsequent decline was accounted for by the prices of imported motor vehicles. No growth was recorded in the prices of other predominantly imported goods in the June quarter. These developments illustrate that the pass-through of wholesale price changes to final retail prices is usually slow, and can vary depending on conditions in domestic product markets. ", " The relationship between the exchange rate and developments in the wholesale prices of imported goods is being complicated at present by the widely divergent movements in trading-partner exchange rates. The <span class=\"no-wrap\">import-weighted</span> exchange rate has depreciated over the past year by around 7 per cent which, on the basis of past behaviour, would usually contribute to a somewhat smaller change in imported goods prices over the same period. The actual increase has been noticeably larger. As Graph 30 illustrates, the rise in the over-the-docks price of imports in the past year has been more consistent with, although smaller than, the decline of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar</span> against the major currencies in the industrialised world (of which the exchange rate against the SDR is a convenient measure). ", " This relationship suggests that the major industrialised countries are having a greater role in influencing the prices of Australia's imports than their share of Australia's trade would imply. Nonetheless, the exchange rate movement against the major currencies must overstate the net impact of the recent currency movements because it does not take account of Asian producers' ability to reduce their prices. Although data on export prices for the Asian countries are fairly scarce, evidence from South Korea shows their export prices have fallen significantly in world currency terms, stimulating strong growth in their export volumes. ", " Softness in world commodity markets, as discussed in the section on Balance of Payments earlier, has also affected Australian producer prices. While the over-the-docks prices of imported final goods increased by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> over the past year, prices of imported inputs into manufacturing rose by 6 per cent and the prices of domestically sourced raw materials fell (Table 6). In both cases, this primarily reflected recent falls in energy prices. ", " Developments in input costs and selling prices presented in the business surveys have broadly lined up with these official data. Input costs are widely reported to have increased following the depreciation of the exchange rate. The NAB survey (which covers the entire non-farm economy) points to a modest increase in prices over the past year. Manufacturing sector surveys, such as the ACCI-Westpac, Colonial State Bank and Australian Chamber of Manufacturers' surveys, suggest there were sharp increases in input costs in the first half of this year, and point to further pressures in the September quarter. On selling prices, the picture is more mixed; surveys of retailers and manufacturers suggest growth in final goods prices has remained subdued, while some price pressure is evident at the wholesale level. ", " Ordinary-time earnings of adults working full time (AWOTE) increased by 0.4 per cent in the three months to May, and by 4.1 per cent over the past year (Graph 31). The increase in this measure of wages continues to display considerable short-run volatility. Nonetheless, there are some signs that its rate of growth has slowed. In <span class=\"no-wrap\">the first half</span> of 1998, AWOTE increased at an annual rate of 3.6 per cent, compared with annual increases of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> prevailing over much of the preceding two-year period. ", " Some confirmation that aggregate wage growth is running at around the 3½ per cent mark is provided by the newly produced wage cost index. The first two available observations for the change in wage costs, covering the December and March quarters, show increases of 0.8 and 0.9 per cent, broadly consistent with what appears to be the trend rate of growth in economy-wide AWOTE (Table 7). However, despite the conceptual superiority of the wage cost index (it is, in principle, unaffected by compositional change and changes to the working week), longer experience with the index will be needed to assess its reliability. ", " The increases awarded under new enterprise bargains have declined over the past year. From a peak of over <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> in private-sector increases, reached in mid 1996, the rate of increase specified in new agreements has declined to 4 per cent in the March quarter 1998, and is likely to have been around the same in the June quarter. A similar trend can be seen from comparisons of new agreements with the expiring agreements they replace (Graph 32). Over the past year, replacement agreements in major enterprises have, on average, specified lower wage rises than the corresponding agreements previously operating. The average difference over the year has been around 1½ percentage points. ", " After declining to low levels in 1997, consumers' inflation expectations, as surveyed by the Melbourne Institute, increased slightly in the first half of this year, most probably in anticipation of the impact of the lower Australian dollar on prices. In June, when there was a sharp fall in the value of the currency, median inflation expectations rose sharply, from 3.4 per cent to 4.5 per cent, their highest rate in two years. Significantly, almost half of the survey's respondents reported hearing news about the exchange rate during the previous month. The latest survey reading, conducted in July when markets were calmer, showed that inflation expectations had dropped back to 3.4 per cent, close to their level throughout the early months of the year (Graph 33). ", " Survey evidence of businesses' inflation expectations provides mixed results on the near-term outlook. The latest ACCI-Westpac survey contained a sharp increase in the net balance of respondents expecting to raise prices in the September quarter, and the ACM survey also shows an expected pick-up in selling prices from a couple of <span class=\"no-wrap\">quarters ago</span>. Both of these are manufacturing-based surveys and are likely to reflect recent increases in the costs of imported inputs. The broader NAB survey found an average expected price increase of 0.4 per cent in the September quarter, which is little changed from recent quarters. At a longer-term horizon, firms' inflation expectations have eased slightly. The number of respondents to the NAB survey anticipating inflation to be greater than 3 per cent over the next ten years declined in the latest survey, although it remains the case that an expected inflation rate in the 3 to 4 per cent range is the most common survey response. ", " A survey of trade union officials, conducted by ACIRRT (Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training) following release of the June quarter CPI, gave a median inflation forecast of 2 per cent over the year to June 1999, rising to 3 per cent over the year to June 2000 (Table 8). The Bank's survey of financial market economists, also taken just after the June quarter CPI release, obtained a median forecast of underlying inflation over the year to June 1999 of 2.5 per cent, down from a forecast of 2.9 per cent obtained in the corresponding survey a year earlier. Respondents to this survey expect inflation to decline over the following year, to a median of 2.4 per cent. ", " The major short-term influence on the inflation outlook continues to be the substantial decline in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar</span> over the past year. The currency depreciation will give a significant boost to import prices, lifting the overall inflation rate further above the trough reached in the December quarter 1997. Recent developments, including a further net decline in the exchange rate over the past few months, appear to have marginally increased the prospective inflation rate in the near term. However, this impact comes at a time when other sources of inflationary pressure are well contained. ", " By early August, the Australian dollar had depreciated by an average of around 15 per cent against the major currencies, from the levels prevailing in mid 1997, but there are several reasons to expect that the effect on domestic inflation might be smaller than would normally be expected from a movement of this size. At the wholesale level, import price increases are being limited by an increasingly tough international competitive environment, particularly where east Asian producers have been able to reduce their export prices in <span class=\"no-wrap\">international currency</span> terms. Domestic sources of inflationary pressure are likely to remain subdued. Labour markets are showing increasing evidence of an easing in wage pressures, and recent declines in business confidence may prompt a tougher stance by businesses in wage negotiations. ", " The net effect of higher import prices and continued subdued domestic inflationary pressures is likely to be a moderate rise in inflation during the period in which import prices are adjusting. The inflation rate is projected to peak at around 2½ to 3 per cent in the second half of 1999, after which, on current indications, it would decline to around the bottom of the target range. A source of risk for the inflation outlook in the short term might arise if there were a significant further weakening in the international environment, putting downward pressure on the currency. However, these effects would be partially offset by the accompanying dampening influence on demand and activity, which could reduce domestically sourced inflationary pressures. ", " From its float in 1983 until recently, the Australian dollar had traditionally been regarded by financial markets as being part of the US dollar bloc. As can be seen in Graph A1, weekly movements of the Australian dollar and the US dollar through most of this period had a high correlation (averaging 0.74). ", " The tight link between the Australian and US currencies owed in part to the close relationship between the Australian and US economies, particularly the similarity of the cyclical development of GDP in the two countries (Graph A2). The tendency for dealers to trade the Australian dollar in line with commodity prices, themselves strongly correlated with US economic growth, may also have contributed to the link, although the correlation of the Australian dollar with the US dollar has been significantly higher than its correlation with commodity prices. Historically there has been no similarity between cyclical movements in GDP in Australia and Japan (Graph A3). ", " Since mid 1997, when the float of the Thai baht precipitated the exchange rate crisis in Asia, there has been increased talk in the market of the Australian dollar (and several other regional currencies, including the Singapore dollar and Taiwan dollar) now having moved into a yen bloc. Over this period, there has been a close relationship between the Australian dollar and the yen, with the Australian dollar trading in a narrow range between 83 and 88 yen (see Graphs A4 and A5). ", " The reasons for this sudden shift in perception are not entirely clear, but are no doubt related to the view that if the Japanese economy does badly, then the rest of the Asian region, including Australia, will suffer. One variation of this is that a falling yen will ‘bring down’ the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar and, in turn, a number of their competitors. While Asian events are having a significant impact on Australia, it needs to be kept in mind that the trade links to Asia are longstanding and, despite them, the Australian economy has typically behaved more like the US economy than Asian economies. This has continued to be the case in the past year. The summary contained in Table A1 shows the remarkable similarity between Australian and US economic performance, and the complete lack of similarity between either of those two countries and Japan. ", " As can be seen from Graph A6, there have been other periods in the past when the correlation between the Australian dollar and the yen has risen. But they have always been short lived. The average correlation between the two currencies over the post-float period has been close to zero. ", " Looked at another way, since the mid 1980s, the yen has been through four broad phases: it appreciated from 1984 through to 1988, then depreciated up until early 1990, resumed its appreciation between 1990 and mid 1995, and then began to depreciate again. In each of these phases until mid 1997, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar</span> showed no sustained tendency to move with the yen. ", " While it is understandable that the exchange rate of  the Australian dollar reflects developments in Asia,  the closeness of the link to the yen that has developed  over the past year seems difficult to justify on the  behaviour of the two economies. It is possible that  the increased correlation is simply a short-term phenomenon,  as experienced on several occasions in the past, rather  than the start of a new pattern. For the correlation  to be sustained, there would need to be a greater correlation  in the economic performance of the two economies, and  at this stage there is no evidence that this will be  the case.

Domestic demand was robust, led by household spending. In addition, demand for Australian exports began to recover, with the result that the growth of GDP remained above 4 per cent. ", " These trends parallel those seen overseas. The United States economy has maintained strong growth, the majority of countries in east Asia have recovered much more quickly than expected, and growth in Europe is also firming. Indicators for Japan are more mixed, but generally suggest a very gradual recovery is under way. Estimates of global growth outcomes in 1999 are higher than forecasts of a few months ago, and forecasts for 2000 have been revised up. A number of commodity prices have risen sharply as a result of these firmer trends, and central banks in a number of countries have raised interest rates from the low levels of recent years. ", " The extent of this strength through the past year, both at home and abroad, was unexpected. For Australia, the effects of the Asian crisis, and the ensuing decline in global growth, had been thought likely to result in a more noticeable and more prolonged slowing in the pace of activity. Exports did weaken during this period, but domestic demand surprised most forecasters by its resilience. Several factors have been at work in producing this outcome. Some of them, like the impact of demutualisations and privatisations, were only temporary. More persistent, and more substantial, support for household demand has come from gains in wealth across major asset classes, and inexpensive and freely available credit. This combination, together with income gains stemming from faster employment growth, has facilitated a strong expansion of consumption, and an increase in spending on housing. There has been an accompanying increase in gross household debt, but household balance sheets remain in reasonably good shape at this stage, since the rise in debt over the past several years came off a rather low base. ", " It is likely that relatively robust growth in activity will continue during the coming year. Even were some slowing of domestic demand to occur in the first half of 2000 – and there is little sign of that at present – growth is likely to be sustained at a strong pace, notwithstanding some tailing off in some areas of construction. ", " The strength of output growth has resulted in an acceleration in employment, which rose at an annualised pace of 3½ per cent during the second half of 1999, its strongest performance in more than four years. The rate of unemployment, just under 7 per cent on average in the December quarter, was at its lowest in almost a decade, with the prospect that a further decline will take place during the current year. Surveys of employers show some increased difficulty in attracting suitable staff. This suggests that while growth in labour costs has been moderate to date, some heightened pressure on wages could occur during the next year or two. ", " Price inflation has increased over the past year, despite the fact that wages growth has not picked up. The Consumer Price Index rose by 1.8 per cent through 1999, a little faster than the rise in 1998. Were it not for the effect of the changes to health insurance arrangements last March, the CPI increase would have been around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¼ per cent</span>. Some of the pick-up is due to the effect of higher international oil prices, which have flowed through to petrol prices at the pump in Australia as in other countries. But core measures of inflation, which are not distorted by the direct impact of changes in oil prices, have also been increasing, running at between <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 and 2½ per cent</span> during 1999, compared with around 1½ per cent during 1998. ", " During the first half of 2000, the Bank expects CPI inflation on a year-ended basis to rise to around 2¾ per cent. Core inflation will probably be a little lower than that, but on any measure, inflation will be in the 2–3 per cent target zone, and probably in the upper half of it. During the September quarter, the CPI will record a sharp increase as a result of the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax. While CPI rises in subsequent quarters are likely to be quite modest, on a year-ended basis the rate of CPI inflation will exceed the 2–3 per cent target, by a large margin, for four quarters. The Bank will, however, abstract from the GST effect for the purposes of assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The Bank is expecting inflation to decline back to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> after the initial GST impact has been seen. Prospects for this are still reasonable, though an environment of strong output and employment growth over the coming year could heighten risks of more persistent inflationary pressures. ", " Financial markets were relatively quiet during the closing months of 1999, with financing and risk-taking activities curtailed on account of the possibility of problems being encountered with the century date change. That event passed without incident, but so far in 2000, financial markets, both in Australia and overseas, have been volatile, reflecting the tensions between strengthening economic activity and rising interest rates. Bond yields have risen due to expectations of higher inflation, and as a result of recent tightenings of monetary policy. ", " In considering Australian monetary policy, the Bank judged that, notwithstanding the increase in cash rates in November, policy remained too accommodative. Given the unexpectedly strong growth outcomes in 1999, and improved prospects for 2000, that degree of support for the economy was clearly no longer necessary, particularly given that inflation was already gradually increasing. Looking ahead, moreover, the balance of risks on inflation is no longer tilted to the downside. Expectations of inflation are considerably higher than a year ago, the disinflationary forces from abroad, while still discernible in some areas, are more likely to wane than to intensify, and the extent of spare capacity in the domestic economy is gradually diminishing. In addition, the substantial increases in some asset prices and credit over the past couple of years raise a question mark. While asset prices <em lang=\"la\">per se</em> are not a target of monetary policy, it is important that monetary policy not inadvertently sow the seeds of future instability by encouraging excessive use of credit. It could be, of course, that developments in asset markets are well-grounded and benign. If so, they will not be much affected by a modest rise in borrowing costs. ", " These considerations all pointed to the need for an adjustment to interest rates, to take them to an approximately neutral setting. The Bank raised cash rates by a further 50 basis points, to 5½ per cent, on <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 February</span>. As with the previous adjustment in November, this change is not intended to end the economic expansion. Growth should be quite good, but by keeping interest rates aligned with the economy's changing circumstances, monetary policy will be reducing the likelihood of imbalances emerging which could impair the longevity of the expansion. ", " The United States economy continued to grow strongly during the second half of 1999. Output expanded at an annual rate of 5¾ per cent, with growth in consumer spending at around the same rate (Graph 1). The ongoing strength in consumption reflects continuing robust employment growth and high levels of consumer confidence. Consumer spending is also being supported by the rising levels of household wealth seen in recent years. Increases in longer term interest rates earlier in the year do not appear to have significantly slowed business investment, which grew at an annual rate of 6.6 per cent in the second half of 1999, although housing investment has weakened. ", " US export growth increased over the second half of last year, reflecting the continuing improvement in international conditions. As a result, manufacturing output is accelerating, with growth in this sector continuing to be dominated by the production of computers and communication equipment. Surveys suggest that businesses expect conditions in the manufacturing sector to improve further in coming months. Despite the pick-up in exports, the current account deficit is likely to have expanded in the December quarter, with imports growing rapidly, reflecting the strength of domestic demand. ", " The ongoing strength in demand and tight labour market conditions may now be having a discernible impact on wage and price inflation (Graph 2). Growth in the employment cost index is showing renewed signs of increasing, although at 3.4 per cent over the year to December, it remains below rates prevailing during late 1998. The recent data show a pick-up in growth in non-wage benefits and confirm that the easing in wage and salaries growth, apparent during much of 1998 and early 1999, has now come to an end. ", " Headline consumer price inflation has also increased since early 1999, due primarily to increases in oil and tobacco prices. While the core measure of consumer price inflation continues to drift lower, other measures of core inflation, derived from the national accounts price indices for personal consumption and GDP, have increased a little from the rates prevailing in early 1998. During the past couple of years, part of the decline in core CPI inflation has been due to the methodological changes to its construction; these changes have now been completed. ", " Responding to the ongoing strength in domestic demand, and its assessment that inflationary pressures are building, the Federal Reserve has raised rates twice in the past three months, in November and February. This takes the Federal Funds rate to 5¾ per cent, 100 basis points higher than the low point reached in late 1998. ", " Elsewhere in the Americas, countries have generally experienced favourable economic conditions, in part reflecting the continuing strength of the US economy. In Canada, the unemployment rate has been below 7 per cent since November for the first time in almost two decades. Although Canada's inflation rate remains subdued, wages growth has clearly increased since the start of last year. The major Latin American economies are continuing to recover. Despite several recent months of relatively high price rises, Brazil succeeded in meeting its first inflation target; through 1999, inflation was slightly above the 8 per cent target midpoint, but well within the <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 to 10 per cent</span> tolerance range. The Mexican economy continues to grow strongly, and the recovery of the Argentine economy, although weaker, is continuing. ", " Activity in Japan – especially private demand – was generally stronger than most observers expected over the first half of 1999, although GDP declined in the September quarter (Table 1). While overall demand conditions look to have improved, the recovery remains fragile, in part because of the uncertainties associated with the resolution of structural problems in the corporate and financial sectors. Nevertheless, there have been encouraging developments in this regard and macroeconomic policies continue to be supportive of growth. ", " A major source of the increase in demand has been exports, which have staged a strong recovery since the middle of 1999. To date, the revival in world growth, particularly across the rest of Asia, has outweighed any loss of competitiveness arising from the appreciation of the exchange rate. A pick-up in consumer spending from its low levels of late 1998 has also contributed to stronger demand, notwithstanding the fall in the September quarter. Consumer confidence continues to improve, reaching its highest level in three years in the December quarter. Business investment is yet to contribute to the recovery, reflecting the large degree of excess capacity in the economy. Investment intentions correspondingly remain weak. ", " Part of the pick-up in domestic demand is being absorbed by imports, which rose by 7 per cent over the year to the September quarter. On the other hand, the inventory overhang that was evident through much of the past two years appears to have been mostly unwound. Demand is thus increasingly stimulating production; industrial production rose at an annual rate just under 10 per cent over the second half of 1999. Employment began to increase in late 1999, following falls over much of the previous year and a half, although firms continue to report that their employment levels are excessive. ", " There remains considerable uncertainty as to the extent to which structural problems in the corporate and financial sectors will inhibit the recovery. There are, however, some encouraging signs. Despite the problems in the corporate sector, business confidence strengthened further in the December quarter and firms expect this trend to continue into the new year. Firms also reported an improvement in their financial position, suggesting that some progress is being made in the repair of balance sheets. Confidence in the financial restructuring program seems to be growing, with the ‘Japan premium’ (the difference between the interest rate at which Japanese banks can borrow US dollars in international capital markets and the US interbank rate) narrowing significantly since the announcement of the financial revitalisation program in October 1998. Moreover, while credit outstanding is still falling (even when loan write-offs are excluded), firms report that banks' lending standards are becoming more accommodative. ", " A fiscal package introducing new spending measures amounting to ¥5½ trillion (or 1 per cent of GDP) was announced in mid November. This package roughly maintains public spending at its 1998 level, and primarily comprises new spending in public works and further housing assistance. The series of fiscal packages introduced during the 1990s has substantially increased the level of public indebtedness in Japan; the OECD estimates that gross public debt outstanding was in excess of 100 per cent of GDP in 1999, up from around 60 per cent at the beginning of the decade. ", " The economies of non-Japan Asia grew strongly during 1999. In general, domestic activity in the region continues to be supported by a strong rebound in private consumption, while investment remains quite weak. The recent strength in activity has carried over into the labour market, with employment picking up across most of the region. ", " The strength seen in domestic demand has been complemented in recent quarters by a sharp rebound in exports, particularly to other countries in the region, including Japan (Graph 3). Over the first three quarters of 1999, export volumes for the region rose at an annualised rate of 16 per cent. Initially, the rebound in exports was concentrated in electronic goods, which began picking up in the September quarter of 1998. While these continue to increase rapidly, the recovery in exports broadened to other sectors during the second half of 1999. ", " Import demand across the region has also strengthened in conjunction with the increase in output growth. Further growth in imports is expected, as inventories have been run down and demand for output, from both domestic and foreign sources, is expected to remain strong. As a result, Asian demand for Australian exports should strengthen in coming quarters. ", " While the recovery across the initial crisis economies continues to consolidate, credit growth remains weak, largely reflecting the still fragile state of these economies' banking sectors. Current estimates of non-performing loans range from 25 to 60 per cent of GDP, and according to the World Bank, the estimated recapitalisation requirements of these economies' financial sectors are substantial (Table 2). Although the bulk of these costs will be met by the public sector, raising public debt considerably, public debt post-recapitalisation is currently expected to remain below the average for OECD countries (70 per cent of GDP) in all countries except Indonesia, since most countries entered the crisis with very low levels of public debt. ", " Activity in Hong Kong reached a trough early in 1999, and has subsequently increased quite strongly. Output increased by 5 per cent between the March and September quarters 1999, following a contraction of 8 per cent over the previous 18 months. Growth has been assisted by public spending, a pick-up in financial services and continued strong growth in tourist arrivals. In contrast, output growth in China slowed to 7.1 per cent in 1999, the lowest growth rate recorded since 1990. Activity continues to be driven by public investment, with exports also growing strongly. Private demand remains weak, although there were signs of retail sales picking up during the latter part of the year. ", " The New Zealand economy is growing strongly. Real GDP rose by 2.3 per cent in the September quarter, having fallen slightly in the previous quarter, to be 4 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 4). Growth has been particularly strong in consumption and housing construction, and, more recently, exports have shown signs of recovery. Inflation, at 1.3 per cent over the year to the December quarter, remains comfortably within the RBNZ's target. However, given the strength of domestic demand and the RBNZ's assessment of the amount of spare capacity remaining in the economy, the RBNZ has increased the official cash rate by 75 basis points, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.25 per cent</span>, since November to avoid a future increase in inflationary pressures. ", " Growth in the euro area picked up during the second half of 1999 (Graph 5). The pick-up was most notable for Germany and Italy, which had until recently been considerably weaker than the remainder of the euro area. The smaller euro area economies continue to expand at a faster rate than their large neighbours. The recent increase in activity largely reflects a sharp increase in export volumes. Exports are being supported by the rebound in growth of the region's trading partners along with the boost to competitiveness afforded by the depreciation of the euro over the past year. Domestic demand is growing at around trend rates for the region as a whole, with consumption growth being supported by growth in incomes. Investment growth remains quite strong. ", " Price pressures in the euro region have picked up somewhat, although this mainly reflects the impact of increased oil prices. CPI inflation rose to 1.7 per cent over the year to December; excluding food and energy prices, it was 0.8 per cent. The European Central Bank increased interest rates in early February, reflecting concerns about the inflationary risks posed by the rise in oil prices, the lower euro, the strength of the world economy, and the ongoing strong growth in credit and money. ", " Activity in the United Kingdom progressively strengthened over the course of 1999. Domestic demand, with the exception of housing investment, continues to grow at around trend rates, and since the June quarter, this has been supported by a sharp increase in exports. The strength in demand has contributed to a fall in the unemployment rate to its lowest level in nearly 20 years, and a noticeable increase in wage pressures. This led the Bank of England to raise interest rates by a further 25 basis points at its January meeting, the third rise since September. Core inflation in the UK is currently slightly below the target rate of 2½ per cent. ", " In the closing months of 1999, concerns about Y2K-related problems had been a major influence on financial markets around the world, but with the century date-change passing without any significant mishap, the focus of markets immediately returned to the underlying strength of the global economy. ", " The effects of Y2K concerns were most evident in short-term yields. The desire by borrowers to secure funding over the end of the year, and the unwillingness of lenders to commit funds over this period, meant that short-term market yields in late 1999 jumped once their maturity spanned the year-end. In the United States, for example, yields on 90-day securities rose sharply in early October, while those on 30-day bills spiked higher in early December (Graph 6).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> While this rise was almost fully reversed in the last couple of days of December, as markets became confident that year-end pressures would be comfortably handled, the structure of short-term interest rates still implied an early tightening in US monetary policy. ", " These expectations about monetary policy were reinforced by the fact that the Fed had explained its decision to leave rates unchanged at its late-December meeting as being designed to help markets cope with year-end pressures. With Y2K out of the way, markets saw no further obstacles to further Fed tightening, fully pricing in the subsequent move of 25 basis points announced by the FOMC in early February, with expectations of more to come in the following months. ", " Other central banks in industrialised countries have also tightened monetary policy again. In January, central banks in the United Kingdom and New Zealand each tightened monetary policy by 25 basis points, the third tightening for the UK in this cycle, and the second for New Zealand (Graph 7 and Table 3). Canada followed the Fed in early February, raising official rates by 25 basis points, while the European Central Bank, citing risks of increasing inflationary pressures, pushed up rates by the same amount. Denmark and Sweden also raised official rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 and 50 basis points</span>, respectively. Switzerland increased its target interest rate by 50 basis points. While the increase in rates has been broadly similar across countries, the level of short-term interest rates in English-speaking countries is somewhat higher than in European countries. This is largely because the former group is at a more advanced stage of the business cycle. ", " Reflecting concerns about the build-up of potential inflationary pressures in many countries as economic growth strengthens, bond yields have continued their upward trend (Graph 8). In the US, yields on 10-year bonds have risen about 50 basis points in the past three months, to 6.6 per cent. In Germany, 10-year bond yields moved by a similar amount to 5.5 per cent. The exception to this global pattern of rising long-term interest rates is Japan, where the yield on 10-year bonds has been steady at about 1.8 per cent. ", " Share markets have been volatile, with periods of optimism about the outlook for profits, particularly in the ‘technology’ sector, interspersed by periods of weakness caused by rising market interest rates. Overall, even though the S&amp;P500 and Dow Jones indices in the US hit new highs in January, falls since then mean that these measures of share prices are no higher than they were nine months ago. The main area of strength in the US share market has been the ‘hi-tech’ stocks. The NASDAQ index, which contains a high weighting of such stocks, has risen by over 50 per cent since early October 1999 and by 90 per cent over the past year. ", " Share markets in other countries have followed the pattern in the United States, with hi-tech stocks leading the way in industrial countries. Japanese technology stocks (JASDAQ) have risen more than threefold since the beginning of 1999 (Graph 9). More broadly based indices of Japanese share prices have also risen strongly over recent months, as pessimism about the Japanese economy subsides (Graph 10). The share market in Germany has been stronger than most, helped by the announcement in December of the abolition of capital gains tax on certain share transactions. ", " The sharp appreciation of the yen during the second half of 1999 has been partly reversed more recently, reflecting intervention by the Bank of Japan and widening interest differentials in favour of the US (Graph 11). The euro has continued to show signs of weakness as it fell to a low of US$0.9665, prior to the ECB's monetary policy announcement. While the increase in interest rates lent some support to the euro, it remains below parity to the US dollar, at about 16 per cent lower than the rate at which it came into existence a little over a year ago. ", " Emerging markets have continued to perform well over the past few months, consistent with the brighter outlook for global economic activity. While these economies were perceived as being vulnerable to Y2K problems, in the event no economy encountered any significant glitches. Short-term interest rates have remained broadly unchanged or have moved a little lower. The benign environment has also been reflected in stronger share markets. Share markets in some of these countries – e.g. Hong Kong, Brazil, Chile and Mexico – reached new peaks, although several have fallen back somewhat recently. Longer-term yields moved lower throughout the December quarter, but signs of stronger economic growth and increased government debt issuance has seen yields rise a little in recent weeks. Emerging-market credit spreads, which had fallen to their lowest level since the upheaval in financial markets in August/September in 1998, have risen about a percentage point to <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 percentage points</span> in early February. ", " The Australian economy continued to grow strongly throughout 1999. The September quarter national accounts recorded growth in GDP of 1.6 per cent in the quarter and year-ended growth of 4½ per cent (Table 4), as the economic expansion continued into its ninth year (Graph 12). More recent information suggests that the strong expansion continued through the closing months of the year, and the economy appears to have entered 2000 with considerable momentum. Exports are now recovering, having been relatively weak for much of the past two years. More generally, the improved outlook for the world economy, the availability of credit on attractive terms and buoyant asset markets are supporting growth in demand and activity at present. ", " Consumption growth, in particular, has continued at a faster than average pace, supported by the gains in employment in the second half of 1999, the high level of consumer confidence and further increases in household wealth. These factors, together with the anticipation of the GST, are also generating an increase in activity in the housing sector. The outlook for business investment has improved over recent months, as business confidence and profits remain at high levels and financing costs remain relatively low. ", " Consumption spending advanced strongly in the September quarter, after a slight pause in mid year. More recent indicators suggest that the strong growth has continued in the closing months of the year. Over the year to the December quarter, retail sales increased by nearly 7 per cent in constant price terms, with a large part of the increase occurring in the second half of the year (Graph 13). The growth in retail sales in 1999 was broadly based across most categories of retailers. Sales of household goods were particularly strong in the latter part of the year, consistent with the pick-up in housing activity, following a period of weaker growth in 1998. Most states recorded strong growth in retail sales in 1999, particularly Victoria where sales increased by 10 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Table 5)</span>. ", " In contrast to the strength in retail trade, sales of motor vehicles were lower in 1999 than in 1998, despite a rebound in November and December. Some of the weakness has been attributed to the anticipated decline in new car prices when the existing wholesale sales tax on cars is replaced by the GST. However, some decline in sales from the peak reached in 1998 was probably to be expected. The extensive discounting and promotion of motor vehicles during 1998 and early 1999, especially at the cheaper end of the market, eased in the September quarter as producers and distributors sought to rebuild margins, though there was some resumption of discounting later in the year. ", " The overall strength in consumption has reflected a high level of consumer confidence. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey, rose in January to be well above its long-term average, although slightly below the level in the middle of 1999. ", " Rising consumption has been partly supported by the ongoing increase in household incomes. Gross household income increased by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter and by 4.5 per cent over the year to September – around the same pace as the past two years. Much of this growth has been underpinned by increases in the compensation of employees, consistent with the performance of the labour market. Reflecting the larger equity holdings of households, dividend income rose sharply in the September quarter, following similarly strong growth in the June quarter. Nonetheless, this remains a relatively small share of household income. ", " Consumption has continued to grow faster than income, so that the household saving rate, as measured in the national accounts, has declined further. This has been associated with an ongoing increase in household indebtedness (Graph 14). Despite this, the leverage of the household sector has not increased much over the past few years as the growth in household assets has kept pace with the increase in household debt. Household assets are estimated to have increased by 1.9 per cent in the September quarter, and by 13.2 per cent over the year to September, underpinned by an increase of 15.8 per cent in dwelling assets over the year to September <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 6)</span>. The rise in debt pushed up the household interest repayment burden slightly in the September quarter (Graph 15). While this servicing burden remains relatively low, the high ratio of household debt to income implies that a rise in interest rates of a given size may have a greater impact on household cash flows than in the past. ", " There is considerable strength in the housing market. Investment in new dwellings increased by nearly <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> in the September quarter and the forward indicators of housing activity suggest continuing strength in the sector. The number of monthly loan approvals for owner-occupied housing, after being flat for most of 1997 and 1998, was about 29 per cent higher in the three months to November than a year ago. The value of loan approvals was 45 per cent higher over the same period, as the average value of a new housing loan approval increased by nearly $15,000 to around $136,000. Lending for investor housing has also increased strongly. ", " The number of private building approvals issued by local governments has accelerated, and was about 16 per cent higher in the December quarter than a year earlier, although it remains around 10 per cent below the mid 1990s peak (Graph 16). The average value of approvals has continued to increase, reflecting an increase in building costs and an ongoing increase in the size and quality of the average new home. ", " These indications of strength in the housing sector probably, in part, reflect the anticipated price impact of the introduction of the GST later this year. The construction and sale of new homes, repairs and renovations to existing homes and transaction costs will be subject to the GST from 1 July 2000, thereby providing some incentive for households to complete, if possible, their construction and repairs before that date. However, it is difficult to ascertain just how much of the current strength in housing activity is GST-related. The First Home Owners Scheme – which provides a grant to first-home buyers of $7,000 for purchases after 1 July – reduces the incentive for that group to bring forward house purchases. There is also some evidence that demand pressures are increasing the cost of getting building work done before 1 July 2000, thereby reducing the incentive to get work done before the introduction of the GST. In any case, most of the impact of the GST should soon be completely reflected in the approvals data, given the lead times between obtaining an approval and completing a housing project. ", " The recent strength in housing demand has been broadly based across Australia (Table 7). The number of loan approvals has increased by more than 20 per cent over the past year in every state. Growth in private building approvals has also been very strong in all states, except New South Wales where housing activity has been relatively steady, although at a high level, for the past two years. In Queensland, housing activity in 1999 was weaker than in previous years, in part reflecting the slowdown in net interstate migration to that <span class=\"no-wrap\">state (Graph 17)</span>. This coincided with a large decline in net emigration from Victoria, which helped boost housing activity there. However, the strength of loan approvals and a recent upturn in building approvals in Queensland suggests that demand there is again increasing. ", " The pick-up in demand for housing across the country has been reflected in rising house prices (Table 8). While most of the growth over the past three years has been in Melbourne and Sydney, more recently house prices have picked up in other states. Over the year to September 1999, median house prices increased by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> in Adelaide and by 5 per cent in Canberra and Perth. According to the Real Estate Institute of Australia, median house prices across Australia were around 10 per cent higher in the September quarter than they were a year ago. The house purchase component of the CPI has also reflected the strength of housing activity, increasing by 3.2 per cent in the December quarter and by 7.9 per cent over 1999. ", " Business conditions and sentiment continued to improve over the course of 1999, following declines in the two previous years, as fears of sharply reduced external demand and slower domestic growth subsided (Graph 18). The National Australia Bank survey for the December quarter showed that overall indicators of business conditions are at their highest levels since 1994. Corresponding to the improved outlook for the world economy, expectations of export sales have improved and are close to their long-run average. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey confirmed the general improvement in confidence across most industries. More specialised surveys of the manufacturing sector – the ACCI-Westpac and Colonial State Bank surveys – also suggest that conditions have improved noticeably in terms of both sales and exports. The results of these surveys generally accord with data suggesting strong output growth, sound profitability and the ready availability of funding. ", " Output, as indicated by the production measure of GDP, increased by 1.6 per cent in the September quarter, underpinned by strong growth in the service industries. Growth was particularly strong in the property and business services sector, at nearly 5 per cent in the quarter and 12 per cent over the year. Mining output was <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.2 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier after declining throughout 1998, as a number of large projects commenced production. ", " According to the national accounts, some of the increased production in the September quarter was absorbed by stock-building. The run-up in inventories suggested in the national accounts appears relatively large compared with the indications from other surveys. Much of it was concentrated in the manufacturing industry, where the inventories-to-sales ratio rose back to the levels of the early 1990s. This largely reflected an increase in the inventories held by machinery and equipment manufacturers. Inventory-to-sales ratios of the retail and wholesale industries did not point to any significant imbalances, despite a build-up in inventories of motor-vehicle wholesalers. Early in the December quarter, the ABS conducted a survey that suggested that less than 10 per cent of businesses were expecting Y2K concerns to affect their level of inventories or sales in the second half of 1999. ", " Corporate profits, as measured by gross operating surplus (GOS), rose by 6.9 per cent in the September quarter, and by 11 per cent over the year, to stand at 15.7 per cent of GDP, slightly higher than the mid 1980s peak <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 19)</span>. The recent increase primarily reflected improved profitability due to continued growth in sales and subdued wages growth, although an increased tendency for businesses to incorporate may also have contributed to the growth of this measure of profitability. Despite a minor increase in net interest payments as a percentage of GOS, the interest burdens of both corporates and unincorporated businesses remain well below their historical averages. While increasing slightly over the past two years, corporate gearing also remains well below the levels of the early 1990s. ", " Total business external funding has remained strong in recent quarters. While there was some easing in growth of intermediated credit, this was offset by strong growth in other sources of external finance. Excluding privatisations and raisings by financial institutions, equity raisings reached a new high in 1999. They represented almost half of the external funds raised by businesses over the year, with placements by listed companies contributing almost half of this. Non-intermediated debt raisings were also strong in 1999; corporates returned to these markets after the international financial crisis of late 1998. Much of this growth was in promissory notes and Australian-dollar-denominated bonds. The increased proportion of external funding obtained through non-intermediated sources continued the trend that has occurred over the past twenty years, as financial markets have become larger and more sophisticated. ", " There has been a decline in the growth of business investment over the past 18 months, as had been foreshadowed in surveys of business investment intentions. In the September quarter 1999, investment increased by 8.1 per cent, but this followed a decline of similar magnitude in the June quarter. Annual figures give a clearer picture of the trend. Over the year to September, business investment increased by 4.9 per cent in real terms, compared with growth of 9 per cent over the previous year and average growth rates well over 10 per cent per annum over the previous four-year period, as the economy recovered from the early 1990s recession. ", " A significant decline in mining investment over recent quarters accounts for some of the weakness in investment growth (as discussed in the <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1999/nov/pdf/bu-1199-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November <em>Semi-Annual Statement</em></a><em>)</em>. The decline in mining investment came from an exceptionally high level by historical standards, and reflected the completion of a number of large projects and the impact of lower commodity prices in the period since the onset of the Asian crisis. At the same time, there was a significant scaling back of planned growth in investment across the economy more widely, particularly in the second half of 1998, reflecting widespread expectations of lower growth in demand and deteriorating export opportunities at that time. ", " Recently, business investment plans have undergone some modest upward revisions, suggesting that these intentions may have begun responding to the more general improvement in business sentiment. According to the ABS Capital Expenditure survey, the expected level of spending on plant and equipment for 1999/2000 was revised upward in the September quarter. Despite the upward revision, the latest survey still implies spending in 1999/2000, on this measure, at around the level recorded in the previous year. ", " Other components of investment spending offer a mixed picture. Forward indicators of construction investment continue to point to declines in spending in the period ahead. Approvals for construction projects have declined over the past year and, if maintained at current levels, would imply some decline in activity. The Capital Expenditure survey also points to a decline in intentions for this kind of investment, although the extent of the anticipated decline has diminished in the past couple of surveys. The third component of investment, spending on fixed intangible assets (mainly computer software), has continued to grow strongly. This component added almost half a percentage point to total domestic expenditure growth over the year to September and now represents around 12 per cent of total business investment spending. While some part of the recent strength undoubtedly reflected expenditure to address Y2K concerns, the strong growth in this component of expenditure has continued a trend that was evident over much of the 1990s. ", " Notwithstanding the flatness in a number of indicators of current investment intentions, conditions still appear to be favourable to further growth in investment spending in due course. As noted above, indicators of general business conditions have been steadily improving and are close to the levels seen at the time of the growth peak in 1994. In the past, high levels of business confidence have tended to be accompanied by strong investment growth. Also noteworthy is that current levels of business investment are well in line with historical averages in relation to the size of the economy. This contrasts sharply with the late-cycle experience of a decade ago, when there was significant over-investment in some areas which limited the scope for growth and eventually led to a sharp correction in investment spending. At present, business investment is running at around 12 per cent of nominal GDP, close to the average for the period since 1980. Hence there would appear to be scope for investment to continue to grow as the economy expands, particularly given the high levels of capacity utilisation being recorded in business surveys at present. ", " Employment growth has picked up since the middle of 1999 (Graph 20). Over the course of 1999, employment increased by about 250000 or 2.9 per cent; three-quarters of the increase was in full-time employment. Growth was concentrated in the second half of the year, with employment increasing at an annual rate of 3½ per cent over the six months to December. Despite some month-to-month volatility, the participation rate has moved upwards since mid 1999, in line with the pick-up in employment growth and the continued expansion of the economy more generally, to reach 63.6 per cent in December. The unemployment rate declined by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">three-quarters</span> of a percentage point over the year to the December quarter 1999, to fall below 7 per cent in the quarter for the first time since mid 1990. ", " The employment gains in 1999 were shared nationally, with employment growth over the year 2 per cent or higher in most states (Table 9). Employment increased particularly strongly in South Australia and Western Australia over the second half of the year. Over the course of the current expansion, the most rapid employment growth has been in Queensland and Western Australia. Unemployment rates in all the states and territories continued to fall during 1999, to reach their lowest levels in more than eight years. ", " Measures of job vacancies suggest good prospects for strong employment growth in the near term. The ANZ Bank measure of job vacancies advertised in major newspapers continued to rise strongly through 1999, although it fell sharply in January, a month in which there is often volatility in this series. The employer-based ABS vacancies survey reported vacancies in excess of the levels recorded in 1994. The latest business surveys indicate that firms' employment intentions for the March quarter 2000 remain at above-average levels (Graph 21). ", " The major business surveys reveal some signs of tighter labour markets, with labour shortages being reported as a constraint on production by a small but increasing proportion of businesses. The December quarter NAB survey recorded a further rise in the proportion of firms describing this constraint as ‘significant’ – this measure is at its highest level since the late 1980s. The ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported that 25 per cent of firms are finding it more difficult to find labour than three months ago, the highest level in more than a decade. ", " In the second half of 1999 there was a marked improvement in Australia's export performance. In large part, this was driven by an improvement in trading partner growth, although the opening of several new resource projects and high levels of agricultural production also underpinned the pick-up. While imports continued to grow strongly, in line with the strength of domestic demand, there was a noticeable improvement in the trade <span class=\"no-wrap\">balance (Graph 22)</span>. ", " Export revenues increased by more than 15 per cent between the June and December quarters of 1999. Revenues were boosted by the export of an ANZAC frigate in October, and continued strong growth in re-exports of gold. Nevertheless, even excluding those items, export revenues increased by over 10 per cent, and more than unwound the falls recorded since mid 1998. Exports to all major destinations grew strongly for the first time since the Asian crisis (Graph 23), reflecting both the pick-up in trading partner demand and the improvement in export prices in A$ terms. ", " The value of resource exports (excluding re-exported gold) increased by 17 per cent over the second half of 1999. This reflected both stronger volumes and prices, and was spread across most major trading partners. In part, the strength in resource exports can be attributed to the increase in the world price of crude oil, combined with the recent development of substantial new crude oil production capacity off Australia's northwest coast. There have also been some significant rises in the exports of other major resource commodities; recent new project openings, the continuing improvement in trading partner growth, and the sustained price rally in base metal markets, for example, have all boosted the value of metal ore and processed metal exports since mid 1999. Although the recent pick-up in world steel production has fed through into stronger export volumes of iron ore and coking coal since June 1999, prices for these commodities remain weak. ", " The improvement in world growth has also supported a recovery in rural and manufactured exports over the second half of 1999 (Graph 24). Strength has been recorded in most categories of rural exports, but particularly for cereals and a broad range of other rural goods. Manufactured export earnings increased by almost 20 per cent over the second half of 1999, boosted, as noted above, by the export of an ANZAC frigate. Excluding the frigate, manufactured exports increased by just under 10 per cent, to reach levels in excess of their previous peak. Stronger exports of transport equipment accounted for much of this growth. Manufactured exports to the European Union and the Middle East have continued to grow strongly, and manufactured exports to South Korea are now more than double their level of eighteen months ago. ", " Service exports increased only modestly in the second half of 1999. There was a recovery in travel service exports, consistent with the slight pick-up in overseas arrivals from Asia and continued strength in arrivals from other parts of the world (notably the United Kingdom). There is expected to be a continuing pick-up in tourism exports over coming quarters in the run-up to the Olympics. ", " The value of imports of goods and services continued to rise strongly during the second half of 1999, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span> higher than a year earlier. In recent quarters, there have been significant imports of lumpy items, among them various defence and oil-drilling equipment, and strong imports of gold, fuel and lubricants. Excluding these, the value of imports increased by about 4 per cent over the year to December, and the volume of imports is estimated to have increased by around 10 per cent, in line with the strength in domestic demand. ", " Capital imports have grown strongly since early 1999, in contrast to the volatility of machinery and equipment investment over the same period. In late 1999, there was again a notable increase in imports of telecommunications equipment, fuelled by the continued expansion and upgrading of the domestic telecommunications sector; imports of computer equipment also increased strongly. Intermediate imports have also continued to grow strongly, consistent with the performance of the economy more generally. Growth in the volume of consumption imports, however, appears to have weakened somewhat over the second half of 1999, as falls in motor vehicle imports more than offset a slight pick-up in growth of other consumption imports. ", " With the value of exports growing by more than 8 per cent in the December quarter, and the value of imports growing by around 4 per cent, the balance of trade on goods and services improved by around ¾ of one per cent of GDP. Assuming an unchanged net income deficit as a proportion of GDP, the current account deficit would have narrowed in the December quarter by a similar amount. ", " Net foreign debt liabilities increased in the September quarter, reflecting both new borrowing and a depreciation in the exchange rate. The ratio of net foreign debt to GDP increased to just under 40 per cent, partly reversing the fall in this ratio over the previous year. Net equity liabilities fell in the quarter, resulting in a small fall in the ratio of total net external liabilities to GDP, to just under 60 per cent. The ratio of net income payments to exports increased a little, to 16½ per cent, in the September quarter. ", " The Bank's index of commodity prices increased in January, in SDR terms, to be slightly above the level that has prevailed since late 1998 (Graph 25). Since August last year, a fall in the price of rural commodities has been more than offset by rising non-rural commodity prices. ", " The weakness in rural prices in the second half of 1999 was spread across most components, with beef, cotton and rice prices all falling by more than 5 per cent in the December quarter. The cotton price fell sharply in response to forecasts of major production increases in the United States and Pakistan, and a substantial increase in exports of cotton by China. Wheat prices, which fell for the fourth successive quarter, were influenced by favourable production conditions in Australia and the three major American producers (Argentina, Canada and the United States). Wool prices have recovered and are now around 20 per cent higher, in Australian dollar terms, than their trough in late 1998. ", " The price index for non-rural commodities (excluding base metals) weakened late in 1999, driven largely by falls in the price of gold. These falls followed the sharp increase in the gold price in late September, when a number of European central banks announced their intention to limit further gold sales. The gold price rose again in early February after one of the world's major gold producers announced that it was suspending its forward-selling program. The prices that Australian exporters receive for both coking and steaming coal have continued to weaken, pushed down by increased competition in the spot market. The negotiations over Japanese fiscal <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (April 2000 – March 2001)</span> prices and volumes for the bulk commodities (iron ore and coal) are currently under way in Tokyo between Australian, Brazilian and Canadian producers and their Japanese customers. BHP has announced that negotiations over premium hard coking coal contracts have been concluded, and these incorporate an average price reduction of around 5 per cent, in US$ terms. ", " The prices of most base metals have continued to rally strongly. Aluminium, copper and zinc prices have all increased by more than 25 per cent over the past year. Nickel prices have roughly doubled, reflecting stronger world demand that has cut substantially into stocks accumulated as a result of the Asian crisis. Cutbacks to production both in Australia and abroad, industrial disputes at some major overseas mines, and slower than expected commissionings at the three new nickel producers in Western Australia have also affected the market. ", " Crude oil prices increased again in the December quarter by more than 10 per cent and, at their current level of around US$28 per barrel, are more than double their price at the same time last year (Graph 26). Industry reports suggest that OPEC producers are holding to their production quota agreements, with the group to meet in late March to discuss the next set of production targets. ", " Short-term interest rates in Australia over late 1999 were affected by Y2K concerns in a similar way to that described for other countries in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-financial-markets\">International Financial Markets</a>’ (Graph 27). But, even abstracting from this, yields on short-term securities have consistently traded above the prevailing cash rate, reflecting expectations of monetary tightening. Since mid 1999, yields on 90-day bank bills have risen about 100 basis points to 5.8 per cent. Around half this increase has taken place since November. ", " Bond yields in Australia have generally moved up in recent months broadly in line with those in the United States, although the combined effect of the early February tightenings in Australia and the US was a drop in bond yields in both countries of about 10 basis points, as these moves added to market confidence that central banks would act to keep inflationary pressures under control. In net terms, the yield on 10-year bonds is up by 50 basis points since early November, to about 7.1 per cent. As has been the case for much of the past six months, this is about 50 basis points higher than the yield on bonds of similar maturity in the United States. ", " This spread has remained much tighter than was the case in the global phase of rising bond yields in 1994. In both episodes, bond yields in the US rose by 2½–2¾ percentage points. Yields in Australia, however, have behaved very differently in the two episodes. The increase of about 2.2 percentage points since December 1998 – about the same amount as that in the US – compares with a rise of almost 4.5 percentage points in 1994. The smaller increase in the more recent episode suggests greater market confidence in Australia's inflationary outlook. ", " Credit spreads on non-government paper have fallen over the past quarter; the spread above Commonwealth Government securities on high-grade corporate paper is around 60 basis points, compared with about <span class=\"no-wrap\">70 basis points</span> three months earlier. Some of this fall, although pre-dating year-end, appears to reflect the moderation of Y2K-related concerns. ", " The rises of a quarter of a percentage point on 3 November 1999 and of half a percentage point on 2 February in the Bank's target for the overnight cash rate were followed by similar increases in interest rates on most categories of variable-rate lending (Graph 28). ", " In the housing market, the cumulative rise of 75 basis points in interest rates on banks' standard variable and basic housing loans has lifted these rates to 7.3 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively. At the time of writing, few mortgage managers had announced increases in their lending rates in response to the February tightening. Those which had done so, however, had moved, on average, by more than the rise in the cash rate. Since June 1999, large mortgage managers have, on average, raised interest rates by almost 100 basis points. The larger rise in these rates than in those of banks reflects the fact that since they do not borrow from retail depositors, mortgage managers tend to be more affected than banks by increases in the cost of wholesale funds in money markets. Housing rates offered by several large mortgage managers are now only slightly lower than those of banks. ", " Banks also raised the interest rates on most other forms of lending to the household sector by a total of <span class=\"no-wrap\">75 basis points</span> in response to the two tightenings, bringing the interest rate on secured personal overdrafts to an average of around 7.4 per cent. Most banks have not announced increases in credit card interest rates following either tightening, but rates on these products were not reduced following the last easing of monetary policy in 1998. ", " Indicator rates for business borrowers were also typically increased by the full extent of the two monetary policy tightenings (although one major bank is yet to announce any increase in business rates in response to the latest tightening) (Table 10). In addition, one bank raised overdraft rates, though not term rates, by 25 basis points in January independent of any moves on monetary policy. The cumulative increases, since last November, in overdraft rates of the major banks therefore range from 75 basis points to 100 basis points, with the average around <span class=\"no-wrap\">80 basis points</span>. ", " Increases in interest rates on new loans at fixed rates have been larger than those on variable-rate loans. These increases mirror the rise in capital market yields, which parallel banks' funding costs for such loans (Graph 29). For housing borrowers, the interest rate on a mortgage fixed for three years is currently 7.70 per cent, around <span class=\"no-wrap\">130 basis points</span> above the trough of last year. Reflecting this rise, the proportion of new housing loans being taken out at fixed rates is at its lowest level in over four years (Graph 30). ", " Small business borrowers have seen a greater increase in the cost of fixed-rate loans, with a three-year fixed-rate loan currently available from around 8.75 per cent, or more than 200 basis points higher than the December 1998 trough. Like borrowers for housing, many small businesses have responded to the increased cost of fixed-rate funding by switching back into variable-rate loans. ", " On the liabilities side of banks' balance sheets, funding costs in wholesale markets, proxied by bill yields, have increased by more than the cash rate but the cost of retail funds has typically gone up by less than this. For example, banks increased the interest rate on transaction accounts with balances of less than $10,000 by up to 20 basis points (in total) in response to the two tightenings; the rate on cash management accounts with balances of up to $100,000 was increased by up to 45 basis points. The relatively small rises in interest rates on transaction accounts following the tightenings of monetary policy largely mirrors the earlier pattern when monetary policy was being eased; in that episode, interest rates on retail deposits generally fell by less than the cash rate. Increases in interest rates on retail fixed deposits have been larger than those on transaction accounts (and in some cases larger than the rise in the cash rate). ", " It is not clear what overall impact these moves in deposit and lending rates will have on banks' interest margins. In the three years to late 1999, however, the relative movements of lending rates and deposit rates resulted in banks' margins falling by about 100 basis points. ", " The Australian share market has to a large degree reflected the swings in the US share market, although the amplitude has generally been smaller. Like the US market, the Australian market reached a new record in early January, but it has since retraced somewhat, in part due to the impact of rising bond yields, and is only about the same level as nine months ago. ", " Prices of resources stocks have risen, buoyed by rises in commodity prices due to the improved outlook for world growth (Graph 31). Within the industrial stocks grouping, the main area of growth was the media and telecommunications sectors, which have various linkages to the technology/ internet sector. Technology/internet stocks themselves have a very small weight in the <em>All Ordinaries Index</em>, although a number of such companies have been floated in recent months and have seen a strong rise in their share prices. The prices of other industrial shares, including banks, showed little or no gains in recent months. ", " The Australian dollar for the most part has continued to trade within the range US63 to US67 cents, in which it has moved since early in 1999. The exchange rate fell towards the bottom of this range in the closing months of 1999, as overseas market participants seemed to reduce their exposures ahead of Y2K. It moved higher temporarily early in the new year, as investors rebuilt their holdings. The exchange rate was volatile ahead of the policy decisions of early February, initially dropping in late January by US3 cents overnight to a low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">US62.2 cents</span>. The catalyst for this sharp fall was the release of favourable CPI data in Australia, which reduced market expectations of monetary policy tightening, at the same time as data releases in the US pointed to the possibility that monetary tightening in that country might be greater than had been expected. Such a combination of moves would have resulted in interest differentials moving in favour of the US. In the event, with the early-February tightening in monetary policy larger in Australia than in the United States, the currency recovered to around US63.5 cents, though it remained well below its earlier level. ", " The trade-weighted index in recent months has behaved in a similar way to the rate against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar (Graph 32)</span>. The index is currently about 56, around the middle of the range that has prevailed over the past year. ", " Growth in credit picked up in the December quarter, following a brief slowdown in the September quarter. In the three months to December, credit grew at an annual rate of 12½ per cent, a little above the rates seen in the first half of the year. This pick-up reflected a partial recovery in business credit and the continued acceleration of credit provided to households. Personal credit grew by 4½ per cent over the three months to December. Two components of this, margin lending for the purchase of shares and credit card lending, increased particularly strongly. Margin lending (including lending by brokers) rose by 12 per cent over the December quarter to stand at $5.8 billion. At year-end, margin lending by banks accounted for 11 per cent of personal loans outstanding (excluding credit cards). Personal credit card lending rose by 6½ per cent over the December quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">22½ per cent</span> over the year; in part, this strength reflects the increasing use of credit cards as a means of payment. ", " The 8 per cent growth in currency over the year to December reflected the strength of the economy. In contrast to currency, growth in the broader monetary aggregates slowed in the December quarter, with annualised growth in M3 and broad money of 3.7 per cent and 3.0 per cent over the quarter. The growth in these aggregates over the second half of the year was well down from that over the six months to June 1999 and the six months to December 1998, primarily reflecting slower growth in the holdings of certificates of deposit. These fluctuations reflect the effects of intermediaries changing their funding sources in response to changing relative costs. There also appears to have been a shift to bank deposits away from NBFIs in the December quarter. ", " Funds under management increased marginally in the September quarter, following growth of 4.6 per cent in the June quarter, and have increased by 14.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter (Table 11). The slower growth in the September quarter reflected the negative valuation effects arising from falls in share prices in the quarter. Nevertheless, managed funds increased their holdings of domestic equities despite the fall in share prices. Within the total, cash management trusts recorded the strongest quarterly growth in assets, while assets of public unit trusts fell during the quarter, mainly due to the reorganisation of some trust assets as companies. Managed funds increased their exposure to long-term securities in the September quarter, reversing a sustained trend away from this asset class, and decreased their exposure to short-term securities. Funds' exposure to overseas assets continued its trend increase. ", " The Australian non-government bond market as a whole (i.e. issues of bonds by financial, non-financial and non-resident issuers), continues to show strong growth. Issues tapered off in November and December due to seasonal influences and Y2K concerns but rebounded in January. The value of non-government bonds outstanding was $64 billion at end January (Graph 33). ", " Measures of consumer prices suggest that inflation increased during the course of 1999. The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, and by 1.8 per cent over the past year (Graph 34). The increase over the year was reduced by the net effect of a number of changes to tax arrangements; in particular, the health insurance rebate, which reduced the CPI in the March quarter 1999, and reductions in wholesale sales taxes and increases in cigarette taxes, which affected the CPI in the December quarter. Excluding these effects, the CPI rose by around 2¼ per cent over the course of 1999, compared with 1.6 per cent over the previous year. A range of measures of core or underlying inflation also indicate price increases of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span> in the December quarter and 2¼ per cent over the year, up from their recent trough of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> (Table 12). ", " A sharp increase in petrol prices contributed to the CPI increase over the past year. Petrol prices rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span> in the December quarter, and by 12.2 per cent over the year. These increases have flowed from the substantial rise in the international price of crude oil, which has more than doubled since early 1999. The increase in petrol prices in the December quarter was somewhat smaller than might normally have been expected to flow through from the rise in crude oil prices. If oil prices remain at current levels, some further increase in petrol prices at the retail level can be expected in the near term (Graph 35). Petrol prices contributed 0.5 percentage points to the increase in the CPI over the past year, although this effect is largely excluded from underlying inflation measures. ", " House purchase prices have also been contributing strongly to CPI increases recently. The measure of house purchase prices used in the CPI, which captures the price of new project homes excluding land, increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.2 per cent</span> in the December quarter and by 8 per cent over the past year. This was well in excess of increases in building materials prices, and reflects the strong demand conditions prevailing in the residential construction sector at present. To some extent, demand in this sector is likely to have been boosted by the anticipated impact of the GST on building costs, although as noted above in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’, the strength of housing demand has also reflected more general factors, including the growth of household incomes and wealth and the low cost of borrowing. Prices of some other items likely to be affected by the forthcoming introduction of the GST have also moved significantly in recent quarters; for example, the costs of house, home-contents and vehicle insurance all recorded strong rises in the December quarter. ", " The increases in these prices in the December quarter were partly offset by declines in the prices of fresh fruit, motor vehicle repair and servicing, audio, visual and computing equipment, clothing and motor vehicles. Part of the decline in the prices of audio, visual and computing equipment recorded in the December quarter was related to the reduction in the wholesale sales tax rate applied to these items last July. ", " The price of the basket of tradeable goods and services measured by the ABS fell by 0.2 per cent in the December quarter and increased by 1.3 per cent over the year, with much of that increase attributable to the rise in fuel prices. Within the basket, prices for motor vehicles have declined further over the past year, although at a slower pace than in previous years. Motor vehicle prices picked up briefly in the September quarter, reflecting efforts to rebuild margins in the industry, but more recently there is evidence of further discounting, with prices declining again in the December quarter. The renewal of discounting may be related to the stronger exchange rate seen in the first half of 1999 and the influence of the forthcoming reduction in sales tax on cars. ", " Prices of other goods with a high import penetration, including clothing, household appliances, and audio, visual and computing equipment have also fallen both in the December quarter and over the past year. While, as noted above, the decline in this latter category was partly in response to tax changes in the second half of last year, this component of the CPI has been declining for some years and fell by more than 18 per cent during 1999. ", " The prices of non-tradeables, which are mainly services, increased by 1.2 per cent in the December quarter, a similar increase to that recorded in the previous quarter, to be 2.3 per cent higher over the past year. The government's health insurance rebate, introduced in the March quarter 1999, has held down this annual rate of increase; over the past two quarters, private-sector services prices, which exclude the health insurance rebate, have risen at an annual rate of more than 4 per cent (Graph 36). ", " Producer prices in the manufacturing industry picked up strongly in the December quarter. Prices of inputs used by manufacturers increased by 4.9 per cent in the quarter (the highest quarterly increase in nine years) and were <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.4 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier (Table 13). Almost half of the increase in the quarter was attributable to higher oil prices, although increases in other commodity prices and a weaker exchange rate also contributed to higher prices of imported inputs late in the year. Reflecting these increases in costs, output prices of manufacturers picked up noticeably in the second half of 1999, rising by more than 3 per cent over the two quarters. Petrol prices contributed strongly, although there were more broadly based increases in a range of other output prices. Excluding petrol, manufacturers' output prices increased by just over 2 per cent over the two quarters; significant price increases were recorded for basic metal products, which rose in line with world market prices, and food, beverages and tobacco. Buoyant demand in the housing industry led to a further increase in house-building materials prices in the December quarter, of close to 1 per cent, although prices of other building materials remained subdued. ", " Indicators of aggregate wage costs available up to the September quarter suggest that wages growth remained moderate (Table 14). The Wage Cost Index (WCI), excluding bonuses, increased by 3 per cent over the year to the September quarter, continuing a run of observations around 3–3¼ per cent per annum. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) rose by just 0.3 per cent over the three months to August 1999, and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span> over the year to August. The August data recorded a decline in private-sector male AWOTE, which is likely to have reflected compositional change rather than an actual decline in wage rates for that group. This suggests that overall AWOTE growth is probably understating the increase in wage rates, and the WCI, which is less affected by compositional change, is likely to be providing a more reliable reading. ", " Average annualised wage increases from new federal enterprise agreements remained at around 3½ per cent in the September quarter (Graph 37). The increase in public-sector agreements was unchanged in the quarter, while the increase for private-sector agreements fell slightly. Replacement agreements in the September quarter yielded lower wage increases than the expiring agreements they replaced. ", " During 2000, a number of enterprise agreements in key sectors of the economy will be up for renegotiation, especially in the manufacturing sector. On recent indications, the process of negotiation appears likely to be conducted more at the industry level than has typically been the case in recent years. Wage increases being sought by some unions are greater than those specified in current enterprise agreements, though they are not dissimilar to the initial claims in previous campaigns. In Victoria, construction unions are also seeking a reduction in standard working hours. In the manufacturing sector, a common expiry date for all manufacturing agreements is being sought. In some instances, claims seek to introduce clauses that would allow for either renegotiation of agreements or additional wage rises if the effect of the GST on the price level is larger than expected. ", " Growth in executive pay, as recorded by the Mercer Cullen Egan Dell survey of around 500 companies, has been relatively stable. The December quarter survey estimates the growth in the base salaries of executives to have been around 4¾ per cent over the past year. The recorded pay increases in this survey do not include any bonuses received or returns from participation in corporate share schemes. ", " In the December quarter NAB survey of non-farm businesses, expectations of labour cost increases were broadly in line with the average quarterly increases reported in the survey over the past two years. Nonetheless, as discussed earlier, the survey points to some tightening in labour market conditions, with businesses reporting that they are finding it increasingly difficult to attract suitable labour (see Graph 21). ", " The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will begin hearings for the 2000 Safety Net Review in March. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is seeking a $24 increase in weekly award rates between the federal minimum wage <span class=\"no-wrap\">($385.40 per week)</span> and $537.80, and a 4.5 per cent increase in award rates between $537.80 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">$930 per week</span>. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has argued that the current federal minimum wage should be maintained. ", " Most measures of inflation expectations have risen noticeably since the first half of last year, as the increase in the price level associated with the introduction of the GST in mid 2000 has entered the forecast horizon. The rise in inflation expectations appears also to reflect, in part, an increase in expected ongoing inflation. ", " The past few surveys of consumers' inflation expectations, conducted by the Melbourne Institute, have reported a median year-ahead inflation expectation of over 5 per cent (Graph 38). This result has increased from a low point of 3 to 3½ per cent in the early part of 1998. Part of the increase is likely to have reflected the general strength of the economy and the gradual upward drift in inflation itself. More recently, the prospective implementation of the tax package has also become a factor. As well as the general rise in the median expectation of inflation, there is some evidence of increased uncertainty about future price developments. Around one-fifth of consumers surveyed in January expected prices to rise by the GST rate of 10 per cent over the year ahead, almost double the percentage of respondents expecting a 10 per cent increase a year ago. These responses do not appear to have allowed for the offsetting price reductions from the abolition of some indirect taxes as part of the overall package. ", " The inflation forecasts of financial market economists, as surveyed by the Bank, indicate some slight upward revisions. Median forecasts for CPI inflation were revised up to 2.7 per cent for the year to June 2000, and <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.5 per cent</span> (excluding the GST) for the year to June 2001 (Table 15). Most respondents have also revised up their expectations of the first-year effect of the GST on the price level, following the release of official estimates last November. Their median forecast for the first-year effect is now 2.8 per cent, with forecasts ranging between 2 and 3½ per cent. ", " Trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), have also revised up their forecasts slightly. The majority of respondents have now incorporated a GST effect in their forecasts. ", " Business surveys suggest that price increases are expected to be slightly higher in the near term than they have been in recent years. The December quarter ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported a further increase in the net balance of firms expecting to raise prices in the quarter ahead. The quarterly NAB survey reported a <span class=\"no-wrap\">pick-up</span> in actual price rises in the September and December quarters of 1999, with this trend expected to continue in the quarter ahead. The growth of actual purchase costs has also picked up in recent quarters, and is expected to rise further in the current quarter. In a special question included in the latest NAB survey, respondents were asked to estimate the impact of the GST on their own prices by the end of 2000; this yielded a weighted average response of 4 per cent. ", " Medium-term inflation expectations of businesses have increased a little over the past year. The majority of respondents to the quarterly NAB survey expect inflation in the medium term to be 3–4 per cent per annum, with the proportion of respondents in this category increasing over the past year; the proportion reporting that they expect less than 3 per cent inflation in the medium term has correspondingly declined (Graph 38). <span class=\"no-wrap\">Longer-term</span> inflation expectations of financial market participants, as implied by the difference between yields on nominal and indexed 10-year bonds, have risen to nearly 3¾ per cent in early 2000, about ¾ of a percentage point higher than the average prevailing in the second half of 1999. While the differing liquidity characteristics of the nominal and indexed bond markets can be important in interpreting movements in this yield differential, there appears to have been a significant increase in inflation expectations in recent months, only part of which can be attributed to the likely impact of the GST. ", " Most measures of underlying inflation have edged upwards over the past year, from a trough of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> to between 2 and 2½ per cent at present. CPI inflation has been more volatile but has also shown a clear upward trend. Excluding the health insurance rebate introduced in early 1999 and the net effect of other recent tax changes, the increase in the CPI over the past year was 2¼ per cent, about the same rate as shown by the underlying measures. ", " Part of this pick-up in inflation, as discussed above, has reflected sector-specific influences, notably the sharp increase in international oil prices and the strength of demand in the housing sector. But more generally, the increase in inflation pressures appears consistent with the overall strength of domestic demand conditions. Over the past three years, output has increased at an average annual rate of over 4 per cent, a pace that probably exceeds the longer-run growth in the economy's productive potential and implies a gradual absorption of surplus productive capacity. This has been evident in declining unemployment and rising levels of capacity utilisation, which are now approaching previous cyclical highs. Demand has continued to increase strongly in the recent period, supported by rising wealth and low borrowing costs, and businesses in most industries are reporting very favourable trading conditions. In these circumstances, some pick-up in price pressures is not surprising. ", " To date, the increase in inflation has remained relatively mild. Despite the strength of demand, product markets remain highly competitive, and the economy does not, in general, appear to have run up against significant capacity constraints. The inflation performance has also benefited from the continued modest rate of increase in labour costs. Up to the September quarter last year (the latest official data available), wage increases remained well contained, and available data on federal enterprise agreements have continued to point to wage settlements around the 3½ per cent mark. In addition the economy has sustained a relatively high average rate of productivity growth in recent years, contributing to the containment of unit labour costs and boosting growth of the economy's productive potential. ", " While it is possible that these factors will continue to restrain inflation in the period ahead, the balance of risks at present is that inflation will increase further. Demand is likely to continue to grow strongly, a prospect that will be enhanced by the strengthening international environment. Labour markets are clearly tightening, with job vacancies at high levels and some businesses beginning to report increased difficulty in obtaining suitable labour. Inflation expectations of consumers and, to a lesser extent, businesses, have also increased. As noted above, petrol price increases are likely to contribute further to the CPI over the next couple of quarters, and they will also contribute indirectly to production costs over a more protracted period. At the same time, high rates of productivity growth may remain a moderating influence on inflation pressures. ", " The Bank's assessment is that a further gradual increase in inflation is likely over the period ahead. The year-ended increase in the CPI should show a noticeable increase in the March quarter 2000 as the decline in the March quarter 1999 drops out of the calculation. By the June quarter 2000, the annual CPI inflation rate should be around 2¾ per cent. Some of this will be due to higher oil prices, so that underlying inflation should be around 2½ per cent. ", " Beyond that time, the ongoing trend in inflation will be obscured temporarily by the once-off effect of the introduction of the GST. It will therefore become more difficult in the short term to assess whether the tendency for inflation to rise in 1999/2000 is continuing into the following year. Nonetheless, the Bank will seek to abstract from the once-off GST effect on the CPI for the purposes of decisions on monetary policy. ", " At this stage, the Bank's assessment is that inflation will return to the target zone after the GST effect has passed. This depends crucially on the assumption that there will be no second-round effects of the GST on wages and prices, arising through opportunistic pricing decisions or through additional compensation being reflected in wage agreements. Should that assumption prove unfounded, inflation would pick up more quickly, with the attendant risk of a more general increase in ongoing inflation expectations. This is a risk that will require close watching in the period ahead. Other uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook are associated with prospects for demand and growth. There is some risk that demand pressures may intensify further, particularly given the strength of the global economy, although that risk will have been reduced by recent moves to a less accommodative monetary policy stance in Australia and abroad.

In 1999 growth once again exceeded 4 per cent, and a good pace appears to have been maintained in the early part of 2000. By mid year, the economy will have recorded nine years of continuous expansion. Unemployment has continued to fall, to be below 7 per cent of the labour force for the first time in almost a decade. These developments have been accompanied, in the past year or two, by a gradual increase in the rate of inflation. ", " In terms of economic growth, the international environment remains a favourable one for the Australian economy. The US economy has continued to expand rapidly, exceeding the expectations of most observers and official forecasters. In Europe growth is also picking up, and economic recoveries across most of the east Asian region are proceeding more quickly than had been expected. The situation in Japan is more difficult to assess, but, overall, there is no doubt that the general trend for the world economy over the past year has been one of increasing strength. Projections have been revised upwards, such that world growth in 2000 and 2001 is expected to be noticeably faster than in 1999. ", " With improved growth prospects in most countries, and signs of over-heating in the United States, central banks in most advanced countries have been raising official interest rates over the past six months. Over that period the level of short-term interest rates around the world has risen by between 100 and 150 basis points. Most of the rise was designed to restore interest rates to more normal levels from the unusually low rates that had persisted in 1998 and the first half of 1999, but for some countries exchange rate weakness was also adding to pressure on future inflation. ", " Although all developed countries, except Japan, have been part of this process, developments in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United States</span> have played a major role. With growth still very strong, a discernible pick-up in price and wage inflation and rapidly increasing equity prices (at least until very recently), the expectation of further tightening of US monetary policy has underpinned developments in world financial markets. Much will depend on the success of US monetary policy in reining back the economy in a timely manner, and this will depend in part on a return to more subdued sentiment in the equity markets. This explains the relief with which the recent falls in share prices, particularly technology stocks, were greeted by those hoping for stability in world financial markets. ", " In international currency markets, the US dollar has generally been under upward pressure, and most currencies with the exception of the yen have depreciated. The Australian dollar has weakened more than most, notwithstanding continuing good domestic economic performance and an improving world economic outlook, a development normally supportive of the currency. ", " Economic growth in Australia is likely to remain quite robust over the year ahead, even though its composition is shifting. Consumer spending, which had been exceptionally strong in 1999, has slowed. This is likely to mean some slowing in the growth of domestic demand, from the very rapid pace it recorded last year. Nonetheless, it would be surprising if consumer spending were to remain as weak as suggested by recent retail trade data, given the continued gains in household income in the recent period, the high level of wealth, and the prospect of substantial tax cuts in the second half of the year. At the same time, exports are now clearly benefiting from the stronger international environment. Hence, while the growth of domestic demand may be easing, external demand should contribute to growth of the economy in 2000, having been a drag on growth for much of the previous two-year period. ", " Developments in economic activity will be unusually hard to interpret during the remainder of 2000 because of the important influence of tax reform on the timing of expenditures. The effects will differ quite markedly across the different types of expenditure, with consumer spending and housing activity being brought forward in net terms, while some business investment and car purchases could be delayed. In the case of retail spending, international experience suggests that much of this impact may be concentrated quite tightly in the months either side of the implementation date. The effect on housing activity will be spread over a longer period, with some GST-related demand already evident in data for late 1999 and early 2000. While the overall package, in net terms, will shift demand from the second half of the year into the first half, demand in the second half will be boosted by substantial income tax cuts and increases in government benefits to be introduced on 1 July. ", " Inflation has gradually increased during the past two years, to be running, according to underlying measures, at an annual rate of around 2¼ per cent, up from around 1½ per cent two years ago. CPI inflation has increased more markedly. While higher petrol prices have contributed significantly to the rise in the headline rate, the increase in underlying inflation more generally reflects the sustained strength of domestic demand in recent years, which has seen a gradual increase in levels of capacity utilisation across the economy. Wage pressures to date have remained moderate, although there have been signs of tightening in labour market conditions, with employers reporting increased difficulties in obtaining suitable labour, and the unemployment rate falling. In these circumstances there is some risk that wage pressures will strengthen, particularly given recent increases in inflation expectations and the prospect of some high CPI figures later in the year. ", " The recent decline in the exchange rate may also have implications for the course of consumer prices over the next year or more. The Australian dollar moved significantly lower against most major currencies in the early part of the year and, in the past month, has averaged a level 7 per cent below its 1999 average in import-weighted terms. This weakness may not persist. If it does, however, or if the currency continued to decline, it would put upward pressure on prices for traded goods and services. The pass-through into consumer prices could be stronger than it was in 1997 and 1998 when more competitive conditions, both domestically and internationally, contained price rises which would otherwise have flowed from a weak exchange rate. Added pressure on prices from this source, at a time when domestic pressure may be intensifying, would clearly be unhelpful. ", " In the near term, the most significant influence on the CPI will be the implementation of tax reform on 1 July. CPI inflation in year-ended terms will, for the first year following implementation, be substantially higher than the target, with the peak effect of the package occurring in the September quarter 2000. As has been made clear in previous Statements, the Bank intends to abstract from these short-run tax effects on the price level in conducting monetary policy, but will remain vigilant against second-round wage and price increases that might lead to an escalation in ongoing inflation. There are good prospects that such second-round effects can be avoided, provided it is widely understood that part of the initial price impact of the package is temporary, and that the overall price impact will be smaller, and more than fully compensated by income tax cuts and increases in government benefit payments. Tax effects aside, and on the assumption that there are no second-round impacts of the tax package or further large falls in the exchange rate, the Bank expects that the recent policy changes should keep inflation within the 2–3 per cent range over the coming year to eighteen months, although, given the pressures identified above, the likelihood is that inflation will be in the upper half of the range. ", " In the past six months, the Bank has tightened monetary policy on four occasions, raising cash rates by a total of 125 basis points, to a current level of 6 per cent. In doing so, the Bank judged that the fairly expansionary policy setting previously in place was no longer warranted, given the economy's changing circumstances. This judgment reflects an assessment of the changing balance of risks facing the economy. That balance has shifted over the past year from a situation where the predominant risk was that of faltering growth and persistent undershooting of the inflation target, to one where the risk of rising inflation has attained greater importance. The most recent interest rate adjustments in April and May continued the process of bringing interest rates to levels where that risk would be reduced. This is in line with the broader goal of promoting sustainable growth by avoiding the build-up of inflationary pressures. ", " The world economy is estimated to have grown by around 3¼ per cent in 1999, a considerable improvement from growth of 2½ per cent recorded in 1998 (Table 1), and significantly in excess of most forecasts of a year ago. At that time, world growth was expected to remain weak in 1999, on the basis that the US economy would slow to below trend rates of growth, and the recovery in the emerging markets would be slow and protracted. Instead, growth in the US remained above 4 per cent in 1999 and most emerging market economies experienced a strong rebound in activity. ", " World GDP growth in 2000 and 2001 is now expected to exceed that in 1999. According to the IMF, the world economy is likely to grow by around 4¼ per cent in 2000 and just under 4 per cent in 2001. Moreover, the IMF argues that there is some risk that the forecast for 2000 may be revised up, if there is more momentum in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US or the euro</span> area economies than currently projected. The outlook for the Japanese economy remains uncertain, especially given the unanticipated fall in GDP during the second half of last year. ", " Capital flows to emerging market economies picked up in 1999, after contracting sharply in 1998 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. The size of capital flows remains considerably smaller than those in the years immediately preceding the crisis (Table 2). ", " Aside from the considerable effect of higher oil prices, inflation rates currently remain quite low around most of the world. But in line with the pick-up in world growth, core consumer price inflation has begun to increase in recent months in most developed countries. Concerns about the inflationary implications of the improved outlook for growth and the rise in oil prices have led to an increase in policy interest rates in many countries in recent months. ", " The strong momentum of the United States economy continued into 2000, with GDP increasing by 1.3 per cent in the March quarter. Over the past 4 years, GDP growth has averaged around 4½ per cent per annum (Graph 1). Household consumption expenditure has been particularly strong, increasing by 2 per cent in the March quarter, and by an average of 5¾ per cent per annum over the past 2 years. The strength of the US economy relative to the rest of the world contributed to the widening in the US current account deficit to 4¼ per cent of GDP in the December quarter. ", " In increasing interest rates by 25 basis points in March, the Federal Reserve highlighted concerns about potential inflation. In recent months, CPI inflation has increased substantially to over 3½ per cent, largely reflecting the impact of oil prices. Core inflation also picked up sharply in March (Graph 2). Excluding food and energy prices, consumer prices increased by 0.8 per cent in the three months to March, and 2.4 per cent over the year to March. Wage pressures are also increasing, with year-ended growth in the employment cost index rising to over 4¼ per cent in the March quarter, from 3 per cent a year earlier. ", " The strength of the US economy continued to support activity in the rest of the Americas. Canadian GDP grew by 1.1 per cent in the December quarter last year, and by 4.7 per cent over 1999. Despite a pause in the December quarter, the Mexican economy expanded by 5.3 per cent over the past year. With the additional stimulus of an easing in monetary policy, GDP in Brazil increased by 4.2 per cent over 1999, while the Argentine economy rebounded from a recession at the beginning of 1999 to grow at an annualised rate of over 5 per cent in the second half of the year. ", " According to the national accounts, the Japanese economy lapsed back into recession in the second half of 1999, following stronger than anticipated growth in the first half of the year. Real GDP fell by 1.4 per cent in the December quarter, following a 1 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. The only component of domestic final demand that rose in the quarter was business investment spending. Most of the decrease in output was due to sharp falls in both private consumption and public investment. The rise in public spending in the first half of 1999 was not maintained in the second half of the year. However, fiscal policy should provide some support to the economy during the first half of 2000, as spending initiatives worth 1 per cent of GDP, announced in November, begin to take effect. ", " Other indicators paint a more positive picture of the economy than that suggested by the national accounts. The index of Overall Business Activity – a production-based measure of economic activity published by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) – has been gradually increasing over the past year (Graph 3), driven by stronger output of service industries (especially communication and finance) and the manufacturing sector. <span class=\"no-wrap\">The Bank of Japan's</span> Tankan survey indicates that business conditions have been improving over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 months</span> and that firms expect this trend to continue into the June quarter, although the general assessment of business conditions remains below its ten-year average. Industrial production rose by 2.7 per cent in the March quarter, and has been rising since the end of 1998, buoyed by exports (particularly of electrical machinery to the rest of Asia) and the unwinding of the inventory overhang. ", " The reform of the financial and corporate sectors in Japan has restrained growth in the short term. Nevertheless, with some recovery in profitability and access to international finance, firms have been reporting a steady improvement in their financial position since the beginning of last year. According to the Tankan survey, firms have also reported an improvement in banks' lending attitudes. ", " While these developments are encouraging, much uncertainty remains about the prospects for consumption. Consumer confidence continues to improve and household spending appears to have picked up in the first few months of this year, but employment has fallen over recent months and the unemployment rate has risen to almost 5 per cent again. Spending by consumers over the past few years has been facilitated by falls in the saving rate as real household incomes have been declining since the beginning of 1998. ", " Activity continues to expand across most countries in non-Japan Asia. While domestic consumption has provided some impetus to growth, much of the improvement has been driven by the export sector. ", " The volume of the region's exports rose by 17 per cent in the year to the December quarter. Intra-regional trade continues to expand strongly, in part because of the high share of intermediate goods, which are processed further elsewhere within Asia and ultimately exported as final goods to countries outside the region (Table 3). This is particularly the case for exports of machinery and transport equipment, which have been a major source of export growth in Asia. ", " The manufacturing sector has particularly benefited from the strong rebound in exports, most notably in Korea where manufacturing output grew at an annualised rate of 25 per cent in the second half of 1999 (Graph 4). The strong growth in the manufacturing sector has led to increased rates of capacity utilisation in some of these economies. This in turn has generated a pick-up in equipment investment, but, in most countries, this has been more than offset by continued falls in construction investment. ", " As these economies continue to expand, the demand for funding to facilitate new investment is likely to rise. For those economies most affected by the financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, this may be inhibited by the need to further repair balance sheets in the financial sector. Total lending by financial institutions to the private sector in these economies has been falling since early 1998, despite some increase in new loans, as existing loans are being written off or repaid at an even faster pace. Some firms are raising funds through alternative sources such as equity and bond issues, particularly in Korea, although this avenue is generally restricted to larger firms. ", " Consumer price inflation has begun to edge up across the region, largely reflecting the increase in oil and food prices. Excluding food and energy, core consumer price inflation remains less than 5 per cent. ", " The New Zealand economy grew rapidly in the second half of 1999, expanding at an annualised rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent (Graph 5)</span>. Private final demand was particularly strong over the second half of the year as were exports, which recovered from a sizeable drought-related fall earlier in the year. In response to the strong pick-up in demand, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has raised interest rates by 150 basis points since November, with the latest move being a 25 basis point increase on 19 April. The strength in activity during 1999 has been reflected in a strong pick-up in employment growth which has seen the unemployment rate fall to 6.3 per cent in the December quarter, the lowest rate since December 1996. At this stage, wages growth remains moderate and inflation remains within the inflation target band, at 1.5 per cent. ", " Growth in the euro area picked up in the second half of 1999 to an annualised rate of 3½ per cent, from <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the first half of the year. The pick-up was particularly evident in the larger economies, although the smaller economies have continued to grow more quickly than the euro-area average. The export sector has been an important source of growth, reflecting the depreciation of the euro and the general recovery in global demand. The employment growth that accompanied the steady expansion in output resulted in a sustained downward trend in the euro-area unemployment rate to 9.5 per cent in February, the lowest recorded in over <span class=\"no-wrap\">six years</span>. ", " Reflecting the impact of higher oil prices, CPI inflation has been on an upward trend over the past year, rising to just over 2 per cent in March (Graph 6). Excluding energy, inflation remained subdued at around 1 per cent, though it is no longer declining. The potential inflationary impact of the declining euro has been a factor in the European Central Bank's deliberations on monetary policy. ", " Economic activity in the United Kingdom also gained momentum over the second half of last year, driven by strength in domestic demand. The tradeables sector was relatively subdued, reflecting the strength of the pound, particularly against the euro. The labour market in the UK remained tight with the unemployment rate at <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.8 per cent</span> in February, the lowest rate in twenty years. Wages have increased sharply, with growth of <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> over the year to February. Nevertheless, despite the labour market pressures and the recent increases in world oil prices, consumer price inflation has remained steady over the past twelve months at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–2¼ per cent</span>, aided by the appreciation of the pound. ", " With economic activity proving to be stronger than anticipated and signs of inflationary pressures rising, central banks in most industrialised countries have lifted policy interest rates to less accommodative settings. ", " This process of global monetary tightening began in the United States in June last year. The United States has now raised the Fed funds target by 125 basis points to 6 per cent in a series of 25 basis point increases. This has lifted the rate back to its early 1995 peak. Financial markets are pricing in additional monetary tightenings by the end of the year. While the Fed has adopted a ‘gradualist’ approach to tightening so far this year, several members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have recently noted that rates might need to increase more aggressively should imbalances continue to build and stronger signs of a pick-up in inflation emerge. Signs that labour costs are accelerating have prompted the market to push up their expectations of the size of the prospective tightening at the forthcoming FOMC meeting. ", " Interest rate increases in other English-speaking countries have been similar. The Bank of England has increased official rates by 100 basis points in four steps to 6 per cent, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has increased rates by 150 basis points to 6 per cent. The Bank of Canada has increased rates by less – 75 basis points – to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.25 per cent</span>, though recently it has begun to follow the US Fed closely, adjusting rates the day following each of the FOMC's announcement so far this year (Graph 7 and Table 4). ", " As growth in the Euro 11 region accelerated and broadened during the second half of 1999, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">European Central Bank</span> began to move official rates back to a more neutral footing. To date, it has increased rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">125 basis points</span> to 3.75 per cent. Also, so far in the current tightening phase, Denmark's central bank has increased rates by the same amount to 4.10 per cent, Sweden by 85 basis points to 3.75 per cent and the Swiss by 125 basis points to a target range of between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent. While the increase in rates has been broadly similar across countries, the level of short-term rates in Europe remains somewhat lower than in <span class=\"no-wrap\">English-speaking</span> countries, largely because European economies are at a less advanced stage of their economic expansions and have lower inflation. ", " Japan remains an exception to the tightening cycle. Continued weakness in consumption, coupled with the large output gap and no inflation, has meant that the Bank of Japan has continued to maintain its zero-interest rate monetary policy. ", " With global short-term interest rates on the rise, share markets in most countries have been prone to increasing volatility over recent months. Share price valuations had previously risen to well above historical norms, as buyers reacted to sustained high growth of productivity in the United States. Share prices of so-called ‘new economy’ stocks, largely those in the technology, media and the communication sectors, rose to particularly high levels, with many commentators arguing that they could not be sustained. While this phenomenon had its origins in the US, it was repeated around the world with remarkable consistency. ", " In the US, the technology-rich Nasdaq index saw dramatic gains through to the beginning of March as investors dumped ‘old’ economy stocks for ‘new’, with the index rising by over 20 per cent over the first couple of months of 2000, on top of a rise of more than 80 per cent in the previous year (Graph 8). During this period, traditional share price indices such as the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 declined noticeably. Growing investor perceptions that there seemed to be a substantial element of a ‘bubble’ in technology stock prices saw the Nasdaq index peak in March and then fall substantially. Downward pressure intensified in mid April due to increasing concerns that stronger inflation data could trigger more aggressive tightening by the Fed. This weighed on broad market indices, not just technology stocks. The broadest share price index available in the US, the Wilshire 5000, which covers over 90 per cent of all equities listed in the US, at one stage had declined by about 15 per cent since its peak in mid March. This is around its level prior to the start of the tightening process in June last year. ", " Thereafter, however, as has happened on several other occasions in the past few years, buyers re-entered the market, supposedly bargain hunting, and share prices recovered. Most broadly based indices in the US are now showing only modest falls from their peaks. ", " Share markets in other countries have followed a similar course (Graph 9). Indices in those countries with relatively higher weightings of technology stocks – such as Germany and Canada – have been more volatile. They rose to record highs in March, came back sharply in line with the fall in the Nasdaq in the US, and subsequently have rebounded. Markets in most developed countries are down by around 6–8 per cent since recent peaks. ", " The Japanese stock market had been very strong through the second half of 1999 as domestic economic conditions continued to improve, and up until mid April, appeared immune to the weakness in markets elsewhere. However, the Nikkei then fell in sympathy with the large falls in the Nasdaq, and has been slower to enjoy the recovery seen in most other markets. It is about 12 per cent below its recent peak. ", " Stock prices in the emerging markets generally increased through the second half of last year, as economic recoveries broadened and strengthened. However, most markets had peaked by early in the new year, and have since been subject to increased volatility, taking their lead from the US market. Several Asian and Latin American markets experienced a large correction in mid April, following the Nasdaq down (Graph 10). ", " After rising in all major economies throughout the second half of 1999, bond yields fell significantly during the March quarter, before rebounding in recent weeks (Graph 11). In the United States, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds had fallen by around 100 basis points from its high in January, unwinding all of the rise that had occurred since the Fed started to tighten in the middle of last year. However, since then, signs that inflationary pressures are building have caused yields to retrace to around 6.3 per cent, more than 50 basis points above its recent low. ", " There has been a significant inversion of the yield curve, with yields on a 10-year bond trading 40 basis points below the yield on a two-year security. This pattern in the yield curve is normally associated with market expectations of slowing economic activity and falls in inflationary pressures. On this occasion, however, it has been accentuated by the fact that US authorities have begun to buy back securities from the market with proceeds from budget surpluses. ", " Other long-term interest rates in the United States show a similar pattern, but remain well above their pre-tightening levels (Table 5). Mortgage rates, for example, are around 50 basis points above their levels of late June last year, compared with little net change in 30-year Treasuries. Similarly, rates on bank and corporate 10-year paper have shown rises of 70 to 100 basis points over that period, compared with the more modest rise in the corresponding Treasury security. ", " In most English-speaking countries, government bond yields have followed those in the US. The fact that most of these countries are also running budget surpluses, and, therefore, retiring debt, has helped maintain the close link with the US market. In contrast, the fall in bond yields in Europe earlier in the year was less than in <span class=\"no-wrap\">English-speaking</span> countries. To a degree, this may be explained by the less favourable fiscal position in Europe. The greater capacity in Europe to increase output without triggering inflationary pressures has seen little rise in yields over recent weeks, compared with the significant rebound which has occurred in the US. ", " Exchange rates among the three major currencies have remained volatile (Graph 12). Through the second half of 1999, the yen had strengthened by about 20 per cent against the US dollar, peaking at around 100 per US dollar, as foreign investors restored exposures to Japan in anticipation of a sustained Japanese economic recovery. It weakened for a time to around 110 per US dollar, as economic data failed to live up to expectations, strengthened again ahead of the end of the financial year, as Japanese institutions repatriated funds and as signs emerged that the recovery may be back on track. The Bank of Japan intervened on several occasions to stem the yen's rise. More recently, however, the US dollar/yen exchange rate has moved back to around 108 with the US dollar strengthening against all major currencies as markets factor in a more aggressive monetary tightening phase by the Fed. ", " The euro has continued to slide against the US dollar and the yen, with its current level against the US dollar more than 20 per cent below the rate at which it came into existence around 16 months ago. This fall has gone against the generally bullish predictions that were made for the currency on its introduction, and has, therefore, caught most market analysts by surprise. Initially, the fall was rationalised by the sluggish economic growth in Europe, but over the past six months, growth has picked up noticeably, yet the euro has continued to slide. Others have pointed to a very strong flow of direct investment out of Europe, said to reflect dissatisfaction with structural reform in Europe. For whatever reasons, the euro has now fallen to a level against the US dollar which <span class=\"no-wrap\">European currencies</span> have not experienced since the mid 1980s. This trend is adding to the current account imbalances between Europe and the US. ", " The major Asian currencies have been relatively stable against the US dollar over the past six months, as have the free-floating currencies of Latin America – Chile, Brazil and Mexico. ", " The Australian economy has grown strongly during the past year. According to the latest national accounts, real GDP expanded by 4.3 per cent over 1999, with somewhat stronger growth being recorded over the second half of the year (Table 6, Graph 13). The pick-up in growth during the second half of 1999 was driven by a marked increase in exports and was supported by continued strength in domestic final demand. ", " Recent indicators suggest that growth in private demand may now be easing back to a more sustainable pace, while exports continue to grow strongly. Declines in both consumer and business sentiment have been recorded in recent periods, and retail sales data have been very weak, although other indicators of current economic conditions have remained quite strong. The pace of output growth in the recent period has, for example, generated continued strong employment growth. This is, in turn, boosting household incomes and, together with the strong growth in household credit and high level of household wealth, should continue to provide support for consumer spending. The strength of the world economy and high levels of profitability suggest that prospects for businesses also remain positive. ", " Two forthcoming events will make interpreting developments in the economy more difficult than usual over coming months. The first is the introduction of the major components of the Government's tax package, <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>The New Tax System</em></span>, on 1 July. This will probably result in expenditure on some components of consumption being brought forward, and expenditure on some components of investment being delayed. Some GST-related acceleration in housing demand appears to be already occurring. In net terms, the international experience suggests that it is most likely that demand will be brought forward into the June quarter (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). This effect will reduce demand in the second half of the year, although offsetting that will be the effect of substantial income tax cuts and increases in government benefit payments from 1 July. ", " The second event is the Olympic Games, which will be held in the second half of September. Most of the impact on output of the preparatory work for the Olympics has already been recorded, and in the September quarter the substantial boost to exports, from broadcast royalties and overseas tourism, and to consumption, from domestic ticket sales, is expected to be largely offset by a run-down in stocks (see <a href=\"#box_c\">Box C</a> in the May 1999 <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>Semi-Annual Statement</em>)</span>. It is difficult, however, to quantify the possible effect of the Olympics on production and expenditure from here on. It is possible, for example, that Olympic-related consumption expenditure, by both residents and tourists, could be greater than currently anticipated. On the other hand, there may be some offsetting effects of the Games on the level of non-Olympic-related production in NSW during this period, as many businesses curtail normal activity. ", " Household consumption expenditure grew strongly during 1999, increasing at an annual rate of 5.8 per cent in the second half of the year. The strength in consumption was broadly based, but was particularly noticeable in spending on durable goods, such as furnishings and household equipment, and communications. Monthly retail sales data suggest that since November, however, consumer spending has weakened considerably (Graph 14). Falls have been recorded in each of the latest three months, and year-ended growth has fallen from just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> over the year to November, to 3 per cent over the year to February. ", " While some slowdown from last year's rapid growth in retail sales was expected, the extent of the recent weakness has surprised most observers of the economy and appears at odds with the ongoing gains in household income and employment. Much of the weakness has been concentrated in a couple of retail trade components. In the latest three months, for example, around a quarter of the total fall in retail trade is explained by falls in sales of clothing, even though these comprise only 5 per cent of total retail sales. Sales at department stores and non-supermarket food sales have also been recorded as particularly weak. On a State basis, the weakness has been particularly pronounced in Victoria, where retail sales have fallen back to their June 1999 level. ", " Some weakening in retail sales growth, however, is consistent with the recent falls in consumer sentiment. Since the beginning of the year the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment has fallen to just below its long-run average, a level last seen temporarily in the middle of 1998. Falls in sentiment have been concentrated in components of the index that relate to prospects for the year ahead, and appear to be partly related to uncertainties about the effect of the forthcoming changes in taxation arrangements and the recent increases in interest rates. In March, the survey reported that nearly 40 per cent of respondents recalled hearing news on taxation issues, up from 14 per cent a year ago, and 17 per cent recalled hearing news on interest rates, up from around 10 per cent a year ago. ", " Over recent years, substantial falls in the relative price of motor vehicles have implied that spending on motor vehicles has evolved somewhat differently to other areas of consumption. Between mid 1996 and mid 1998, heightened international competitive pressures placed considerable downward pressure on motor vehicle prices, particularly at the smaller end of the market. As a result, the average price of new motor vehicles fell by around 10 per cent, before stabilising in early 1999 (Graph 15). These price movements contributed to the very high level of sales in 1998 and the subsequent weakness in 1999. Since late 1999, some further discounting has occurred and motor vehicle registrations have again picked up. In this case, however, some of the price discounting appears to be related to the changes to indirect tax arrangements to be introduced in July, which should reduce the final price of motor vehicles. It seems that some manufacturers and wholesalers have brought forward a portion of the expected price fall in an attempt to smooth production and sales. ", " Household disposable income increased by a little over 2 per cent in the December quarter, to be 4½ per cent higher than a year earlier in nominal terms. This was somewhat weaker than the growth in consumption spending during the year, implying a further decline in the household saving ratio. In the period ahead household income is likely to be supported by growth in employment and increases in average wages. Both of these components increased further in the March quarter and, from July, household disposable income will be boosted by the reduction in personal income taxes and increases in social benefits. ", " In recent years, consumer spending also appears to have been supported by the high level of household wealth that has accumulated, though perhaps not to the same extent as in some other countries (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>). Household wealth is estimated to have increased by a further 6 per cent in the December quarter, the largest quarterly increase recorded in the decade, to be 15½ per cent higher than a year earlier. Both dwelling and share prices rose particularly strongly in the quarter. Tight conditions in the housing market are likely to support dwelling prices in the near term, though the recent volatility of the share market has made the outlook for financial assets less certain. How these developments in wealth will affect consumer spending is difficult to determine. On the one hand, it is possible that increased volatility in share prices could adversely affect consumer sentiment and this could weaken spending. On the other hand, the total gains in wealth in recent years have been very strong and the current ratio of consumption to wealth is at an historically low level. The current level of wealth could thus prove sufficient to support further growth in consumer spending, even given some correction in share prices. ", " To date, households have continued to expand their borrowing at a rapid pace, with total household credit increasing by just over 16 per cent over the year to March. Within the total, growth in housing credit was a little stronger in the first months of 2000 than in the previous year, continuing the trend increase in housing credit growth since late 1998. Strong growth in housing credit is consistent with real and nominal home loan interest rates prevailing in 1999 being at or near historical lows, although it may also reflect some bringing forward of dwelling purchases and building activity before the introduction of the GST. Personal credit has continued to grow strongly, increasing by over 17 per cent over the year to March, and has been boosted by rapid growth in bank margin lending (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). In the March quarter, margin lending increased by 8.4 per cent, following growth of 12.2 per cent in the previous quarter. Outstanding margin debt now stands at $6.3 billion and accounts for <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.6 per cent</span> of outstanding personal debt. Taken together, the continued strong growth in both housing and personal credit suggests that consumers do not perceive current borrowing conditions to be very restrictive, although behaviour may not have had time to adjust fully to recent increases in interest rates. ", " The rising ratio of household debt to income (Graph 16) has combined with recent increases in nominal interest rates to increase the interest repayments required of the household sector. The ratio of household sector interest payments to disposable income increased to 6½ per cent in the December quarter, up from its most recent low of around 6 per cent in the March quarter 1999 (Graph 17). Over the next couple of quarters, as debt continues to rise and the interest rate increases that have already occurred flow through, these ratios are likely to rise to around the peak recorded in early 1996, despite the fact that interest rates remain considerably lower than at that time. This reflects the increased influence that interest rate increases have on households when gross debt burdens are higher. ", " Conditions in the housing sector have been buoyant during the past couple of years and forward indicators of activity continue to point to further strength in the near term. Although dwelling investment as recorded in the national accounts fell by 3 per cent in the December quarter and increased by only 2½ per cent over the previous year, the level of dwelling investment as a share of GDP remains high (Graph 18). By most measures, this cycle now looks to have been almost as strong as that of the early 1990s. ", " Loan approvals and building approvals data, moreover, point to further substantial increases in dwelling investment. Although the value of loan approvals rose by only 1 per cent in the three months to February, it remains more than 30 per cent higher than a year earlier. In part, this strength has been driven by further increases in the average value of a new housing loan. Growth in the value of private building approvals has also been strong, rising by nearly 14 per cent in the three months to February, to be 37 per cent higher than a year earlier. This growth has been driven by approvals for houses. Although much of the strength in building approvals over the last few years has been in Victoria and New South Wales, growth in housing activity in the other States has picked up during the last year to rates in excess of 30 per cent (Table 7). ", " An important influence on the housing market at present is the introduction of the GST on 1 July. With the construction and sale of new homes, repairs and renovations to existing homes and transaction costs incurring the GST from 1 July 2000, there is an incentive for households to bring forward their construction spending to before that date. This may be offset to some extent by demand pressures and capacity constraints that have increased the cost of getting work done in the first half of this year, and by the Government's introduction of a First Home Owners Scheme which provides a grant to first home buyers of $7,000 for purchases after 1 July. Overall, however, the introduction of the GST should imply that housing activity is boosted in the first half of the year relative to the second half, although capacity constraints mean that some activity planned for the first half of the year will probably spill over into the second half. ", " The growing gap between dwelling commencements and the leading indicators of dwelling activity suggests an increasing stock of work yet to be done in the housing sector (Graph 19), possibly reflecting an emergence of capacity constraints in the industry. In NSW and Victoria, where capacity constraints appear to be most prevalent, dwelling investment as a share of GDP now exceeds the peaks recorded in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Most of the other states have recorded increases in this ratio more recently, the one exception being Queensland where oversupply from the previous upswing in the middle of the 1990s has taken longer to be absorbed. Capacity constraints in the industry are also evident in some price and labour market data. The house purchase component of the CPI, which reflects the cost of project homes, grew by 8 per cent over the year to March, while the cost of materials used in house building has accelerated after a period of relatively subdued growth. Skilled vacancies in the construction industry, as recorded in the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) survey, have also risen sharply over the past year or so. ", " The strength in the housing sector across the country has been reflected in rising house prices. According to ABS and REIA data, strong price rises over the past year or so have been recorded in all state capital cities with the exception of Brisbane (Table 8). Price rises have been particularly strong in Melbourne and Sydney. This pattern is also reflected in dwelling rents, where significant gains have been recorded in Sydney and Melbourne, with Brisbane showing little growth. ", " Businesses have experienced favourable conditions over the last year, with domestic demand remaining strong and the prospects for exporters having improved considerably. The disparity in conditions across industries, which had been a feature of the last couple of years, has also been reduced. This is particularly evident in those industries with a high export share, such as mining and to a lesser extent manufacturing. These industries experienced difficult conditions during the Asian financial crisis, but as world demand has accelerated, production has picked up. Mining production rose by 10 per cent over the year to December, aided by the large number of new projects that have been coming on-line, particularly in the oil, gas and base metals sectors. Manufacturing production fell in the middle of last year, but bounced back by just under 3 per cent in the December quarter to be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> higher over the year. Elsewhere in the economy, growth in output continues to be strongest in the service sector, particularly in the communications industry where output rose by nearly 18 per cent over the year to the December quarter. ", " The current level of profitability of the corporate sector also seems to be reasonably strong, according to both the official data and the financial reports of listed companies. Although corporate GOS fell by just over 2 per cent in the December quarter, this followed a substantial rise in the previous quarter, and over the year to the December quarter profits rose by 7 per cent. As a share of GDP, corporate GOS after interest remains near recorded <span class=\"no-wrap\">peaks (Graph 20)</span>. ", " In recent months indicators of current and prospective business conditions have been more mixed. Most of the major business surveys suggest that conditions in the March quarter were not as strong as in the robust December quarter, although in most cases, the overall level of business conditions remains well above long-run average levels (Graph 21). According to the quarterly National Australia Bank (NAB) survey, however, businesses have become somewhat more pessimistic about the longer-term outlook. This may reflect their concerns about the likely effects that the recent increase in interest rates, higher oil prices, the introduction of the GST and other changes to business taxation arrangements will have on their operations and the economy more generally. In Victoria, where business confidence has fallen particularly sharply, this deterioration may also reflect concerns about the recent increase in industrial disputation. ", " Despite these indications of lessening of confidence, however, businesses' raisings of external funds are continuing to grow strongly. Business credit has on average picked up in recent months, after several months of more moderate growth, to grow at an annual rate of around 10 per cent in the six months to March. The overall pick-up in business credit growth in recent months has been broadly based across lenders and products, with fixed-term lending particularly strong. ", " Businesses also continue to raise a significant amount of funds directly from capital markets. Gross equity raisings in the December and March quarters have continued at the robust pace seen earlier in 1999. This strength, reflected in both new listings on the stock exchange and issuance of additional equity by existing public companies, was no doubt encouraged by the high level of share prices at the time. In comparison, direct debt raisings have slowed a little in 2000 from the pace seen in 1999. ", " The strong financial position of the corporate sector and the improvement in business conditions over the last year has been reflected in a further modest improvement in the outlook for business investment (Graph 22). Investment in machinery and equipment, while volatile, has generally exhibited little growth over the last couple of years (Graph 23), with uncertainty regarding the global outlook probably dampening firms' investment plans. There may also have been some deferral of investment on account of the forthcoming introduction of the GST. As the outlook for the world economy has improved and capacity utilisation rates have increased, however, the outlook for machinery and equipment investment has picked up. According to the latest ABS Capital Expenditure survey, firms have further upgraded their machinery and equipment investment plans for 1999/2000, and they now expect to increase investment in machinery and equipment in 2000/01 by about 12 per cent in nominal terms. This should amount to quite strong growth in real equipment investment in 2000/01, although interpreting the CAPEX figures is complicated by the introduction of the GST, as it is not clear how firms have accounted for the impact of the introduction of input tax credits on their investment expenditure plans. ", " The outlook for investment in buildings and structures is less positive. After a number of years of quite strong growth, which took buildings and structures investment to a relatively high level as a share of GDP, spending in this area has been falling over the past few quarters. The immediate outlook for non-residential building activity looks particularly weak with the level of non-residential building approvals so far this year suggesting that there are insufficient new projects to sustain the current level of activity (Graph 24). The outlook for investment in structures is better, with work continuing on a number of infrastructure projects. An improved outlook for the mining sector should also provide some support to this component of investment, since around 60 per cent of mining investment is in buildings and structures. ", " The third component of business investment, which includes investment in intangible fixed <span class=\"no-wrap\">assets (mainly computer software)</span>, livestock and mineral exploration expenditure, continues to grow very <span class=\"no-wrap\">strongly (Graph 23)</span>. Over the last four years this component has grown at an annual rate of 22 per cent and it now accounts for around 18 per cent of new business investment, compared with 12 per cent four years ago. Virtually all of this strength relates to the computer software component, which comprises more than 80 per cent of this category. Growth of this order of magnitude is not surprising, as high rates of depreciation of this type of capital mean that a high amount of investment has to be undertaken just to keep the existing capital stock in place. Similar rates of growth in computer software investment are being recorded in the US. Although over the longer term Australia has tended to spend less on computer software than the US, Australian levels of spending on software are now approaching US levels (Graph 25). ", " Employment has increased strongly during the past year, reflecting the overall strength of economic activity. Over the year to March, employment increased by almost 3 per cent, compared with growth of around 2 per cent over the previous year. More than two-thirds of the increase in employed persons over the past year has been in full-time positions, roughly corresponding with the share of full-timers in total employment. Employment growth has been particularly strong in the construction and services industries, which have been among the <span class=\"no-wrap\">fastest-growing</span> parts of the economy recently. ", " The overall strength of the labour market over the past year continued in the March quarter, with employment increasing by 60 000, or 0.7 per cent. The unemployment rate has declined, and averaged 6.8 per cent in the quarter, compared with an average of 7½ per cent in the corresponding period a year earlier. Some of the growth in employment has also been met by increases in labour force participation, as previously discouraged workers may have re-entered the job market; labour-force participation increased to a three-year high of <span class=\"no-wrap\">63.6 per cent</span> in March (Graph 26). ", " The improvement in labour market conditions during the past year has been widely spread across States <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 9)</span>. Most States recorded employment growth well in excess of 2 per cent over the year to the March quarter 2000 (with Queensland the only exception). Similarly, unemployment rates across most States and Territories have continued to fall, and are currently at their lowest levels in over nine years. While there has been some regional variation, both cities and non-metropolitan areas recorded strong employment gains: the average growth in employment in non-metropolitan areas over the year to the March quarter 2000 was 3.1 per cent, slightly higher than the growth in metropolitan areas. ", " The recent strong gains in employment have followed a period of slower employment growth during 1998 and into the early part of 1999. During that period, employment had been somewhat weaker than might have been expected given the strength of the economy, possibly reflecting the adverse impact that the Asian crisis was having on business confidence at that time. As employment growth has picked up in the more recent period, and with output growth remaining fairly steady, there has been some decline in labour productivity growth <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 27)</span>. Measured in terms of output per hour worked, productivity fell slightly in the December quarter, and year-ended productivity growth in the past two quarters has been running at a rate of around 1¾ per cent, a bit below the average growth rate recorded in the course of the current economic expansion since 1991. ", " A high level of job vacancies continues to point to strong labour demand, though there has been some divergence among the alternative indicators recently. The ABS measure of job vacancies, based upon a survey of employers, increased by over 9 per cent in the three months to February and stands at record levels. Both the ANZ Bank and DEWRSB measures of job vacancies have been quite volatile in recent months, but they have remained high, 13–17 per cent higher than their levels of a year ago. Indicators of near-term employment intentions present a similar picture (Graph 28). The NAB business survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturing firms in the March quarter both suggest that near-term employment intentions are at high levels, though they have fallen below the peaks recorded in mid 1999. Both surveys also suggest that firms are having greater difficulty in obtaining labour than has typically been the case in recent years. (See the section on ‘<a href=\"#labour-costs\">Labour costs</a>’ in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#inflation-trends-and-prospects\">Inflation Trends and Prospects</a>’ below.) ", " Australia's external accounts have improved since the middle of 1999, with the trade deficit narrowing from about 3 per cent of GDP in the June quarter 1999 to around 2 per cent of GDP in the March quarter 2000 (Graph 29). Export values (excluding the export of the ANZAC frigate) increased by about 5 per cent in the March quarter, while import values increased by 3½ per cent. Export growth has been broadly based across the major categories <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 30)</span>. ", " The continued strong growth in export revenues reflects the ongoing recoveries in the economies of most of Australia's trading partners. Exports to all regions have increased since June 1999, and in particular, exports to east Asia have increased by nearly 30 per cent over that time. Revenues have been bolstered by gains in a broad range of commodity prices in the March quarter, which in aggregate had remained flat in the second half of 1999. A number of large new resource projects have approached full capacity in the new year, and rural production levels remain high. ", " About half of the increase in resource export earnings over the past two quarters was the result of large gains in the value of oil, gas and petroleum exports. These gains flowed from the increase in the price of oil and related products, in conjunction with expansions in the production of these commodities as major new projects reached full production. Export revenues from processed metals and base-metal ores also increased strongly over the past six months. The commencement of production at a number of ore-related projects and the solid recovery in demand from some major east Asian trading partners underpinned these gains. The recovery in world demand has also contributed to a pick-up in export volumes for some of the major bulk commodities over the past few quarters, particularly iron ore. ", " The value of rural exports continued to increase in the March quarter. The volume of rural exports was bolstered in recent quarters by the high level of agricultural production, although this has eased in the early part of this year. The 1999/00 wheat crop is estimated to be at a record level of 24 million tonnes; similar strength in a number of other cereal crops has seen the volume of cereals exported also reach record levels. By contrast, beef exports have slowed, as, after a number of years of very strong growth, herd rebuilding has begun in earnest. Wool exports have enjoyed a rebound in demand from major foreign buyers. ", " Manufactured export revenues (excluding the frigate) continued to grow solidly in the March quarter, after strong growth in the second half of 1999, to be about 13 per cent higher than a year earlier. The gains in the second half of 1999 were underpinned by a large increase in the export of transport equipment, particularly to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Middle East</span>, which has subsequently eased. Manufactured exports to the US and Europe have been particularly strong recently, and exports to east Asia have begun to recover from the troughs in late 1998 (Graph 31). ", " In contrast, the performance of service exports was less robust in the March quarter. This is, in part, attributable to falls in visitor arrivals from two of Australia's major tourist markets, Japan and the United Kingdom (Graph 32). Japanese tourist arrivals have been on a downward trend since 1997, reflecting the lacklustre growth in Japanese disposable incomes through this period. By contrast, the fall in arrivals from the UK in December and January followed a large sustained surge in the middle of 1999. In the period ahead, the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the approach of the Olympics is likely to provide a substantial boost to tourism exports. ", " Underlying import values increased by just under 7 per cent in the March quarter, an acceleration from the second half of 1999. Given a modest rise in import prices in the quarter, this suggests a strong rise in import volumes. Consumption imports remain very strong, and motor vehicle imports have recovered somewhat from the sharp fall in the December quarter. Underlying capital import volumes increased by about 20 per cent over 1999, almost entirely a result of increases in computer and telecommunications imports. The strength in capital imports continued into 2000, with telecommunications imports again being the major source of growth. ", " Net foreign debt rose in the December quarter, but was largely unchanged as a share of GDP at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span>, where it has been for a number of years. The ratio of net income payments to exports decreased slightly, to 16¼ per cent, in the December quarter. ", " The prices of many of Australia's commodity exports rose strongly in the first 3 months of the year after remaining flat through 1999. The Reserve Bank index of commodity prices increased by 4 per cent in SDR terms in the March quarter (Graph 33). More recently, however, commodity prices in aggregate have fallen, with strong gains in rural prices being more than offset by weaker base metal prices. ", " The strong rise in the base metals index in the March quarter was largely a result of a substantial increase in nickel prices, and, to a lesser extent, aluminium prices. Nickel prices rose as a result of the continuing strong demand from stainless-steel producers, and also the threat of supply disruptions due to labour disputes at some large nickel producers. Similar conditions of strong demand and low inventory levels underpinned the rise in aluminium prices. The more recent falls in base metal prices have been driven by expectations of a moderation in the outlook for demand for base metals. The gold price was flat in the quarter, although there was substantial price volatility, particularly in early February when a number of gold producers announced their intentions to reduce forward sales programs, causing the price to spike by over US$30 per ounce in the space of a few days. ", " Contract negotiations for bulk commodity prices for the current Japanese fiscal year (April 2000–March 2001) were recently concluded. Price rises of between 4 and 6 per cent (in US dollar terms) were agreed for iron ore exports, recovering some of the substantial cuts in the previous round of negotiations. Price cuts of about 4–5 per cent were negotiated for steaming and coking coal. These price changes will be reflected in Australia's export prices from the June quarter. At current exchange rates, prices for coal and iron ore will rise by around 4 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">14 per cent</span> respectively in A$ terms from their levels a year earlier. ", " In late March, a group of nine OPEC members announced their intention to increase production of crude oil, as of 1 April 2000, back to pre-April 1999 levels. As a result, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has fallen by about US$9 per barrel since its peak of around US$34 per barrel in early March. Reports of higher-than-anticipated stock levels in some major oil-consuming countries also reinforced the recent fall in oil prices. While Australia is a net importer of oil, the price changes have flowed through to other related gas and petroleum products. ", " The rise in rural commodity prices in the March quarter was predominantly driven by very strong increases in wool and cotton prices. Wool prices have been supported by strong demand from major buyers including China and Italy. The rise in cotton prices reflected stronger demand from Asian mills. Smaller price rises were recorded for barley, beef, rice and wheat. In contrast, sugar prices fell sharply in the March quarter, reflecting continuing world oversupply. More recently, sugar prices have recovered a little as demand from Asia and Russia has improved and adverse weather affected crops in the major sugar-growing regions of Queensland. ", " For reasons outlined earlier, the Bank has raised the target for the cash rate, in four steps, by 125 basis points over the past six months. These policy moves had in each case been anticipated by the market. The yield on 90-day bills, for example, began to rise in mid 1999 – well ahead of the first rise in the cash rate in November – and has consistently been above the prevailing cash rate target since then (Graph 34). While Y2K influences were a contributing factor for a period late in 1999, expectations about monetary policy have been the main underlying influence on short-term yields. ", " As noted earlier, virtually all developed countries apart from Japan have raised interest rates by between 100 and 150 basis points over the past six months or so, and to that extent developments in Australia have been part of a general worldwide trend. ", " Australian short-term interest rates have remained below those in the US throughout most of this period. Australian short-term interest rates fell below those in the US in 1997, when the US tightened monetary policy and the Bank eased (Graph 35). For most of the period since then, Australian rates have been around 50 basis points below those in the US, though this gap closed with the latest tightening. ", " Long-term market interest rates in Australia have for several years now been strongly linked to those in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United States</span>, possibly reflecting the link between the business cycles in the two countries and the broadly similar performance on inflation. Not surprisingly, therefore, the rally in bond yields in the United States in recent months has also been reflected in the Australian market, as the yield on 10-year bonds fell from about 7.3 per cent in late January to around 6.5 per cent early in May (Graph 36). As in the United States, this rally in Australia was also associated with a marked flattening of the yield curve, partly influenced by the favourable supply outlook for government bonds in Australia with the government continuing to run budget surpluses. ", " If anything, however, bond yields in Australia have recently fallen by more than those in the US. In early May, the yield on 10-year bonds in Australia was about 25 basis points above the corresponding yield in the United States, compared with an average level of around 50 basis points in the final months of 1999 and for much of the first quarter of 2000 (Graph 37). ", " Banks, typically, passed on the 1 percentage point rise in the overnight cash rate involved in the first three tightenings by raising interest rates on variable-rate loans by a similar amount. Banks have not yet responded to the latest tightening. Increases in banks' lending rates since end October are summarised in Table 10. ", " In the housing market, banks' standard-variable and basic lending rates are currently <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.55 per cent</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.0 per cent</span> respectively. Mortgage managers have increased interest rates on housing loans by more, on average, than have the banks, and by more than the increase in the cash rate, mainly because these lenders fund themselves in wholesale markets; consequently, their cost of funds has been pushed up by the larger increase in bill yields than in the cash rate over the past year (Graph 38). ", " Banks also raised the interest rates on most other forms of lending to the household sector by a total of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage point</span> in response to the first three policy tightenings, bringing the interest rate on residentially-secured personal overdrafts to an average of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.70 per cent</span>. Those major banks which have announced increases in credit card rates in response to the first three policy moves have increased these rates by an average of about 0.9 of a percentage point. ", " In the case of business loans, as well as responding to the first three tightenings of monetary policy, three major banks have also made additional adjustments to overdraft indicator rates, so that the increase in overdraft rates of these banks exceeded that in the cash rate by up to 0.5 of a percentage point. ", " Banks' fixed-rate loans rose by about 1.75 percentage points during 1999, in line with rises in yields in the capital markets in which these loans are funded. More recently, however, these rates have started to fall, again reflecting movements in capital markets. The interest rate on a three-year fixed-rate housing loan is currently 7.90 per cent, around 150 basis points above the late 1998 trough. The comparable indicator rate for a small business loan is 8.30 per cent, 200 basis points above the trough in late 1998. Despite the net rises over the past year, interest rates on fixed-rate loans, like those in variable-rate loans, remain below their previous cyclical low (Graph 39). ", " Interest rates faced by borrowers in Australia remain low, both in real and nominal terms (Graph 40 and Table 11). For example, notwithstanding the rise in interest rates to end April, the level of real and nominal interest rates for housing, personal and small business loans are still noticeably lower than at the time of the previous cyclical low in the structure of interest rates in 1993/94. At end April, intermediaries' variable interest rates for the household and small business sectors were about 120 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, below their cyclical lows in 1993/94, reflecting greater competition among intermediaries which has produced a noticeable contraction in their interest margins. In real terms, intermediaries interest rates were also lower than in 1993/94. ", " The <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> has been subject to similar, although generally less pronounced, gyrations to those evident in global share markets. The domestic market rose strongly from late in 1999, reaching a record high in late March, before falling in the past month or so (Graph 41). The peak in the share market in Australia came somewhat later than that in the Dow Jones index mainly because shares in the <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> were pushed higher early in 2000 by the strength of shares in <em>News Corporation</em> – the largest company listed in Australia – which were boosted by the strength of ‘new economy’ stocks globally. Excluding <em>News Corporation</em>, the pattern of moves in the <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> was similar to that in the broader US share price indices. The <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> is now about <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> below its peak of mid March; excluding <em>News</em>, it has fallen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. ", " Most components of the <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> have fallen so far in 2000. The industrial sector (excluding financial companies and <em>News Corporation)</em> has fallen. Share prices of resource companies (excluding gold producers) have fallen by 12 per cent; share prices of gold producers have fallen by 29 per cent. The exception to this pattern of falling share prices was share prices of banks and insurance companies, which have risen by 1 per cent so far in 2000 (Graph 42). This rise is due, in part, to recent takeover activity as well as a growing perception that Australian financial institutions look to be ‘cheap’, in global terms, on standard valuations. ", " As in other countries, prices of technology stocks have been volatile. The <em>Warburg Dillon Read (WDR) Technology Index</em> of share prices of technology companies in Australia rose strongly, following the Nasdaq index, in the second half of 1999, moving to a peak in late March more than double its level in June 1999. Since then, however, the <em>WDR</em> index has fallen by about a third. ", " After trading in a range of US63–67 cents through most of 1999, the Australian dollar has depreciated markedly in the first few months of this year, falling below US59 cents. As in the case of the euro, this fall has gone against generally bullish assessments by market analysts on the outlook for the currency. Early in the year, these bullish assessments looked like being borne out, as the currency rose to the top end of the aforementioned range. But in late January, the situation changed abruptly (Graph 43). ", " A view developed, encouraged by some softer economic data in Australia and some political comments about interest rates, that Australia was unlikely to match the anticipated monetary tightening in the US. The short-term interest differential relative to the US, already negative, was therefore expected to move further against Australia. ", " These considerations caused the exchange rate to fall by nearly US3 cents in one night in late January. Recovery over subsequent days was minimal and, before long, a downward trend emerged. A contributing factor was that the volatility of that night caused some investors to reassess the risks and returns in holding long Australian dollar positions, and to reduce their exposures accordingly. ", " Some analysts have sought to explain the fall in the Australian dollar as being more due to share market developments than interest rates. The reasoning here was that Australian companies were largely ‘old economy’ type companies and, therefore, out of favour with international investors. While perceptions about share markets may have played a role in the Australian dollar's weakness, it is unlikely this was a significant factor. The Australian <em>All Ordinaries Index</em> through the March quarter performed better than traditional US indices, such as the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Dow Jones</span>, and in line with the US Wilshire 5000 Index, which is a very broad index including technology stocks. The relatively good performance of the Australian share price index was due to <em>News Corporation</em>, whose share price rose very sharply through this period, in line with media stocks worldwide. In any event, movements in the exchange rate tended to coincide more with news which markets saw as affecting interest differentials. For example, the exchange rate took another significant step down in early March after the release of retail trade data which were significantly weaker than expected. ", " The Bank has not intervened in the foreign exchange market as, apart from the very sharp fall in late January, the fall in the exchange rate has been orderly. It has, however, gone back to meeting a significant part of the Government's foreign currency needs from reserves rather than putting them through the market. ", " Credit growth has picked up steadily in recent months, driven by increases in the rate of both household-sector and business-sector borrowing. Total credit grew at an annual rate of 13¾ per cent over the six months to March, compared with rates close to 10 per cent around the middle of last year (Table 12). Within the total, annualised growth in credit provided to the household sector was more than 17 per cent over the six months to March, compared with just over 10 per cent for credit provided to the business sector. ", " Growth in the deposit aggregates slowed substantially in the second half of 1999, from the more robust growth seen around mid year. Although, on some measures, deposit growth has picked up again in 2000, recorded growth rates are still generally lower than the mid-1999 peak. Broad money and M3 grew at annual rates of around 7 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in the six months to March 2000. The slower growth of money relative to credit reflects the fact that intermediaries have found it more cost effective to fund their domestic lending with international raisings, rather than by growing their domestic liabilities. ", " Funds under management increased by around 4½ per cent in the December quarter, compared with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.7 per cent</span> growth recorded in the previous quarter (Table 13). Continuing the pattern of the recent past, this growth is likely to have been driven by large valuation effects arising from movements in domestic and overseas equity markets. Growth in managed fund assets over the year to December slowed slightly, to just above <span class=\"no-wrap\">14 per cent</span>. Within the aggregate portfolio of fund managers, the share of domestic equities and overseas assets (which are mainly equities) has risen, at the expense of traditionally less volatile assets such as deposits and debt securities, reflecting the good performance of share markets. ", " The non-government bond market in Australia continued to grow in recent months. Over the past year, the stock of bonds outstanding grew by around 50 per cent to $69 billion. Preliminary figures suggest that the level of non-government bonds on issue has now surpassed the level of Commonwealth Government securities outstanding (Graph 44). ", " In recent months, issuers have shown increased willingness to approach the market for larger amounts and longer terms – one issuer raised more than $1 billion with a single offering (the largest non-government issue to date), while another issued maturities as long as 20 years (the longest bonds issued in Australia without a government guarantee). Growth in this market over the past year has been broadly-based, with the corporate sector, non-residents and asset-backed bonds all showing strong increases (Table 14). ", " Measures of consumer price inflation increased further in the March quarter. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.8 per cent over the year, representing a sharp rise in the year-ended inflation rate from 1.8 per cent in the December quarter (Graph 45). The increase in CPI inflation is partly attributable to the dropping out of the health insurance rebate, which had reduced year-ended inflation rates during 1999. Other important contributing factors to increasing inflation in recent quarters have been the strong rise in petrol prices, driven by earlier increases in international oil prices, and recent increases in tobacco excise. ", " Measures of underlying inflation, which exclude or are less sensitive to movements in these volatile components, point to a more gradual increase in inflation over the past couple of years. Private-sector goods and services prices show an increase of 2¼ per cent over the year, as does the CPI excluding fresh fruit and vegetables and petrol, which is a broad measure of core inflation. The median and trimmed mean series are currently a little higher. Most of these indicators have increased fairly steadily over the past two years from a trough of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> (Table 15, Graph 46). ", " Petrol price movements, as noted above, have broadly followed movements in international oil prices. These peaked in March at above US$30 a barrel, but settled back to a level of around US$25 a barrel in April (Graph 47), following an OPEC decision in late March to increase production. Despite the recent decline, oil prices remain more than double the price prevailing in early 1999, and the increase over the past year has contributed significantly to rises in headline inflation rates in most industrial countries. In Australia, petrol price increases contributed <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 percentage points</span> to the rise in the CPI in the March quarter, and 1 percentage point to the increase over the past year. If international oil prices remain around their April level, this would be likely to imply a small decline in petrol prices at the pump from their average March quarter level in the next quarter or two. ", " The cost of house purchase, which has the largest weight of any individual component in the CPI, continued to rise in the March quarter, to be 8 per cent higher over the year, contributing significantly to the increases in CPI and underlying inflation. The increase reflects the sustained strength of demand in the housing sector, which has for some time been supported by the ready availability of housing credit on attractive terms, and the emergence of supply bottlenecks in some parts of the housing industry. Some of the recent strength of housing demand also reflects the anticipation of higher costs associated with the introduction of the GST. Other housing costs have also been increasing, with privately owned dwelling rents rising by 3 per cent over the year, and property rates and charges by around 5 per cent. The price of insurance again rose strongly in the March quarter, largely reflecting the effect of the GST in current annual premiums. ", " These increases in prices in the March quarter were partly offset by further falls in the price of fresh fruit, and discounting in the price of overseas holiday travel and accommodation (some of which is seasonal). Prices of other predominantly imported items, such as audio, visual and computing equipment and household appliances also fell in the March quarter. The price of imported motor vehicles was flat in the quarter, but overall, car prices rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span>. Over the past six months, car prices have nonetheless declined by 1.1 per cent, partly reflecting discounting by vehicle manufacturers ahead of the introduction of the GST. ", " As has been the case for some time, prices in the tradeables sector of the economy have on average risen more slowly than those in the non-tradeables sector. The prices of tradeable goods and services rose by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter and by 1.8 per cent over the year. Non-tradeable prices (a category dominated by services but also including house purchase prices) rose strongly in the March quarter, to take the year-ended increase close to 4 per cent. Taking out the effect of prices of items that are regulated or have a high tax component, private-sector goods price increases are running at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent, up from 1.1 per cent a year ago. The rate of increase of private-sector service prices has eased slightly, but remains above <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent (Graph 48)</span>. ", " It is too early at this stage to see any effects of recent exchange rate weakness in the CPI. In import-weighted terms, the exchange rate reached a recent peak in mid January and has since declined quite sharply, to a level that is now around 7 per cent lower than the average during 1999. Some effect of the lower exchange rate is already evident in import prices at the docks, which (excluding oil) rose by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter, though the main impact on dock prices is likely to be recorded in the June and September quarters. ", " Strong growth in producer prices in the manufacturing, housing and some service industries continued in the March quarter (Table 16). In the manufacturing sector, price increases have been driven mainly by the rise in oil and base metals prices. Input prices increased by 3.7 per cent in the March quarter, to be 13.1 per cent higher over the year, with both domestic and imported input prices increasing strongly. Rising oil prices have accounted for much of the increase in input prices over the past year, but prices for base metals and chemicals also contributed and, even excluding crude oil, a significant pick-up in input-price increases is clearly evident. ", " Rising input costs have in turn contributed to a sharp pick-up in prices of manufactured outputs. Over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>, manufactured output prices have increased by 5.6 per cent. While the price increase in the fastest-growing component, refined petroleum, has been directly related to the higher price of crude oil, there have also been broadly based price increases across other parts of the manufacturing sector. Excluding petroleum, manufactured output prices rose by 2.9 per cent over the year to the March quarter, a sharp turnaround from the declines being recorded in these prices less than a year ago (Graph 49). ", " In the housing sector, the growth of materials prices has picked up further, reflecting the buoyant demand conditions in the industry. In the March quarter, house-building materials prices rose by 1.9 per cent, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.6 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier (Graph 50). The increases have been broadly spread across the major cities, although the most rapid increases continue to be in Sydney and Melbourne. Growth in other building materials prices also picked up in the March quarter, but remains moderate over the year. ", " The strong demand in the housing sector is also evident in newly available data on service-industry prices. These show prices of property and business services having increased by 6 per cent over the past year, reflecting the effects of rising property prices and the increased demand for these services in the recent period. Prices of transport and storage services have shown little net movement over the past year but increased noticeably in the March quarter, probably partly reflecting increased fuel costs. ", " The Wage Cost Index for total hours (excluding bonuses) increased by 3.0 per cent over the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">December 1999</span>, the same rate of increase as was recorded over the year to September (Graph 51). This measure of wages growth has remained at or slightly above the 3 per cent mark since annual figures became available in late 1998. Data for average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) have, in contrast, shown more variability, and suggest an increase in wages growth recently. AWOTE increased by 4.0 per cent over the year to February 2000 compared with an increase of 3.1 per cent over the corresponding period a year earlier, and has grown particularly strongly in the two latest quarters. While this increase may signal some pick-up in aggregate wages growth, the volatile nature of these figures makes it difficult at this stage to draw firm conclusions. New federal enterprise agreements in the December quarter yielded average annualised wage increases of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 per cent</span>, slightly lower than those recorded earlier in the year (Table 17). In general, discounting the recent volatility in the AWOTE figures, the data suggest that growth of wages has remained well contained over the past couple of years, an outcome that has no doubt been helped by low inflation and generally low levels of inflation expectations. ", " While the Wage Cost Index, which is the broadest measure of aggregate wage rates, suggests little change in overall wages growth in the recent period, there are some indications that tighter labour-market conditions may add to wage pressures in the period ahead. The major business surveys continue to point to a tightening labour market. The proportion of firms describing labour shortages as a ‘significant’ constraint on output, as reported in the March quarter NAB survey, remains at a higher level than has been typical in recent years. The ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported a substantial net balance of firms finding it more difficult to obtain labour, with the proportion of manufacturing firms citing labour availability as the most important factor limiting production at its highest level since the late 1980s (see <a href=\"#g28\">Graph 28</a>). ", " The extent to which these tighter labour market conditions might translate into higher wage outcomes remains to be seen. A number of major enterprise agreements are currently being renegotiated in industry-wide campaigns in the Victorian construction and manufacturing sectors. To some extent these outcomes will also influence agreements due for re-negotiation next year in other States. In the construction industry, a reduction in the standard working week to 36 hours has been a key demand in recent negotiations, and has been accepted by some employers. The exact impact this will have on hourly unit labour costs is not yet clear, and will depend on the extent to which offsetting productivity improvements are achieved. ", " An important uncertainty in the wages outlook at present is the potential impact of GST-related clauses in wage agreements. A number of recent negotiations, including those in the above-mentioned industries, have sought to include clauses aiming to provide additional compensation for the effect of the GST on the cost of living, over and above the compensation already provided for by income tax cuts and increased benefit payments. Approaches to this issue have varied quite widely, with some unions seeking specific compensation for CPI movements in excess of stipulated benchmarks, while others have sought a general right to re-open negotiations in the event that the GST impact on the CPI is larger than anticipated. The number of agreements containing clauses that could be triggered by GST-related price increases appears, at this stage, to be relatively small. However, there are signs that claims for such clauses to be incorporated in agreements will become more common in the coming months, hence adding to the degree of uncertainty in the outlook for wages growth over the next one to two years. ", " In its Safety Net Review decision, announced on 1 May, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission granted a flat increase of $15 a week in all award wage rates. This amounts to an increase of 3.9 per cent in the federal minimum wage. The increase is somewhat higher than those granted under last year's decision, which was for an increase of $12 for award rates below $510 a week, and $10 for those above that level. ", " Survey-based measures of inflation expectations continued to rise in the early part of 2000. This increase has partly reflected the impending introduction of the GST, which is expected to have a significant once-off effect on the price level, but may also reflect expectations of generally rising inflation in the context of a strongly growing economy. Rising global oil prices over much of the past year are also likely to have had a noticeable effect on inflation expectations, although more recently oil prices have been easing. ", " Consumers' year-ahead inflation expectations, as recorded by the Melbourne Institute survey, have increased during the past year, though the survey results have displayed considerable volatility at times (Graph 52). The median inflation expectation increased particularly sharply in the early months of 2000, reaching a peak of around 7½ per cent in February and March, before declining in April to 5.6 per cent. The recent volatility in the median expectation is partly a result of the clustering of consumer responses around whole numbers of 0, 2, 3, 5 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent;</span> this pattern has led to large shifts in the median stemming from some relatively small changes in the number of consumers reporting a 10 per cent expected inflation rate. Nonetheless, looking through the volatility, the general trend over the past year has been towards higher inflation expectations. While it is difficult to distinguish the expected effect of the tax package from other influences (petrol prices, for example), the generally increasing number of 10 per cent responses (currently around one-fifth of the sample) may reflect uninformed expectations on the part of some consumers of prices increasing by the full GST rate. This expectation, of course, takes no account of the offsetting effect of the abolition of the Wholesale Sales Tax and some other indirect taxes. ", " Business expectations for increases in costs and final product prices have generally picked up recently. The NAB business survey has in recent quarters reported a rise in the expected rates of increase in costs and prices, though the overall level of near-term inflation expectations implied by these measures is still quite low (Graph 53). The ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturing firms shows a more pronounced pick-up in actual and expected output prices (Graph 54), consistent with the trend in producer price indices reported above. In the March quarter, the net balance of firms expecting to raise prices was close to its previous peak in early 1995. The same survey also reports an increase in expected production costs, though to a lesser extent. The Colonial State Bank survey reports similarly strong cost and price pressures in the NSW manufacturing sector. ", " The inflation forecasts of financial market economists, as surveyed by the Bank following publication of the March quarter CPI, indicate some upward revisions, particularly for the year to June 2000 (Table 18). The median forecast for inflation over the current financial year is now 3.0 per cent, with the upward revision likely to have partly reflected the effect of recent increases in petrol prices. The forecast for inflation (excluding the GST) over the year to June 2001 was also revised up further to 2.6 per cent. Forecasts of the effect of the GST centre around 2¾ per cent, unchanged from the previous survey. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of financial markets, implied by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, have shifted quite markedly in recent months. The implied 10-year inflation expectation increased to a peak of around 3¾ per cent in mid January, but has since declined to an average of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span> in the past month, primarily reflecting movements in nominal bond yields. Given financial market volatility and the differing liquidity of nominal and indexed bonds, not too much significance should be attached to short-term fluctuations in this indicator. Nonetheless, despite their recent decline, the inflation expectations embedded in these markets remain clearly higher than they were a year ago. ", " The sharp increase in CPI inflation in the March quarter was widely expected, and owed much to two factors – the dropping out of the impact of the health insurance rebate (which had reduced the CPI in the March quarter 1999) and the recent increases in petrol prices. Nonetheless, abstracting from volatile influences, a more gradual rise in inflation has been evident for some time. Underlying inflation is currently around 2¼ per cent, up from a trough of around 1½ per cent two years ago. ", " One factor behind the gradual increase in underlying inflation has been the strength of domestic demand. The economy has for some time been growing more quickly than the growth of productive capacity, posting average annual growth of more than 4½ per cent over the past three years. With strong demand conditions, businesses have found it easier to increase their prices, and there has been some increase in inflation expectations of consumers and businesses, which appears to be only partly related to the expected impact of the GST. A particular area of demand pressure over the past year has been in the market for housing, but a range of underlying inflation measures indicate that price increases have been more broadly based. ", " At this stage there is no evidence of the economy encountering widespread capacity constraints, although supply bottlenecks have clearly emerged in parts of the housing industry recently (partly related to the bringing forward of demand ahead of the GST). More generally, measures of capacity utilisation for the economy have increased over the past couple of years and, although they have eased more recently, they remain at relatively high levels. ", " Recent developments in the exchange rate may have an important influence on the inflation outlook. In import-weighted terms the currency is around 7 per cent lower than its average in 1999. There is considerable uncertainty in assessing the likely impact of this currency depreciation on inflation. The longer-term history of the relationship between the exchange rate and import prices would suggest that, were the exchange rate to remain around these levels, there would be some significant upward pressure on inflation during the year ahead. This expectation is tempered to some extent by the experience of the past two years, when a substantial currency depreciation in the wake of the Asian crisis had a much smaller than anticipated effect on import prices. On the other hand, the currency depreciation on that occasion was accompanied by strong global disinflationary pressures which are no longer present. Indeed, the global economy is now stronger than at any time in the past three years. On balance, it would be surprising if, in the event of the recent currency depreciation being sustained for a significant period, this did not add noticeably to domestic inflationary pressures. The inflation outlook will therefore depend importantly on how long the lower exchange rate is sustained. ", " Another important influence on prospective inflation will be developments in wage-setting. As has been noted above, available indicators of aggregate wages (mainly covering the period up to the December quarter) continue to point to wages growth being well contained, although there are a few recent signs that wage pressures may be starting to increase. Labour market conditions have been tightening over the past year, and businesses have been reporting increased difficulties in obtaining suitable labour. In these circumstances, some upward pressure on wages growth might be expected to develop in the period ahead. The risk of a significant acceleration in wages could be heightened by increased inflation expectations, and by the high headline inflation figures that will be associated with the implementation of tax reform. One mechanism by which this might generate additional wage increases is through renegotiation clauses in wage agreements that could be triggered by the GST; there are signs that claims for these types of clauses to be incorporated into agreements may become more prevalent in the months ahead. It is also possible that high CPI outcomes might trigger a more general increase in ongoing price and wage expectations. ", " The Bank currently expects that in mid 2000, the year-ended rate of CPI inflation is likely to be around 3 per cent, with underlying measures of inflation generally around 2½ per cent. The introduction of the GST will then temporarily push inflation a good deal higher. The exact effect is uncertain, but based on the Government's published modelling of the tax package, the net impact of the GST and the removal of other taxes is expected to add around 2¾ per cent to the CPI over the year to June 2001. The effects of the elimination of wholesale taxes will probably take a little time to flow through completely, given that some of these taxes are levied at intermediate stages of production and will be embedded in production costs when the new system is introduced. Hence the very short-term impact of the GST could be expected to be somewhat larger than the 2¾ per cent expected by the end of the first year. If this is the case, the CPI rises in ensuing quarters would be relatively small, and the annual rate of CPI increase would be expected to decline gradually, though it would remain high during the first year. In the September quarter of 2001, it would then decline sharply as the GST initial impact dropped out of the calculation. The negative impacts of the reductions in other taxes flowing through to prices could then continue to hold <em>down</em> the CPI inflation rate for one or more quarters. ", " These effects will mean that it will, for some time, be difficult to discern the ongoing inflation rate by looking at the CPI – possibly until the first half of 2002. Existing measures of underlying inflation will also be affected by the GST. As a result, careful interpretation of the data will be required. ", " On present assumptions, inflation on a year-ended basis, and net of tax effects, is projected to be between <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 and 3 per cent</span> in the second half of 2001, though possibly rising towards the higher end of that range. The assumptions underlying this projection include no second-round effects of the GST on wages and prices, and an average exchange rate around recent levels. ", " In the event that second-round effects on wages did occur to a significant degree, inflation would be higher than the forecasts envisage and there would be an increased risk of ongoing inflation exceeding the target. The extent of this risk would partly depend on how community expectations respond during the implementation of the tax package. It will be important for the community to recognise that a significant part of the initial price impact is temporary, and that the overall effect of the tax package is more than fully compensated by other changes to taxes and benefits. Similar considerations apply to the assumption of the exchange rate remaining around recent levels. In the event of a further sustained depreciation of the exchange rate, the forecast would be subject to upward revision.

This would leave the investor with a portfolio valued at about $67,000, a loan of $47,000 and investor's equity of $20,000. This sale of shares is larger than the margin call in cash or securities because, as the investor's equity has been reduced to $20,000 by the decline in the market value of the portfolio, the maximum loan size this will support is about $47,000.

", " Canada, Japan and New Zealand are three countries that have relatively recently introduced GST-type taxes as part of a broad-ranging reform of the taxation system.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> In all of these countries, as in Australia, the introduction of the GST coincided with a reduction in other indirect tax rates, so the prices of some goods were expected to rise, while others were expected to fall. In each case, however, these reforms were expected to lead to a once-off rise in the aggregate price level. Economic conditions at the time these tax changes were introduced varied across the three countries; conditions were very buoyant in Japan, quite soft in New Zealand and very weak in Canada. In each case, however, there is clear evidence that the introduction of the GST had significant transitional effects on some components of domestic demand. These transitional effects were concentrated in the couple of months immediately before and after the introduction of the new tax. ", " Although it is often difficult, even with hindsight, to disentangle GST-related effects from underlying trends, these effects appear to be fairly clear in the available data on consumer expenditure for each of these countries. In each case, the aggregate level of retail sales, for example, was significantly boosted in the month or two before the GST was introduced, and was correspondingly weaker in the subsequent two or three months (Graph A1). This effect was particularly pronounced in New Zealand, where the once-off rise in the aggregate price level was expected to be greater than in Canada or Japan because the New Zealand reforms involved the most significant change in taxation arrangements. ", " This shifting in expenditure was primarily confined to spending on goods; the consumption of services was largely unaffected by the tax changes because it is quite difficult to shift the timing of much of this expenditure. An analysis of retail trade by store type indicates that across types of goods, the shifting of expenditure was greatest for big-ticket durable items such as furniture and household appliances, and most limited for food (Table A1). Interestingly, although motor vehicle prices were expected to remain unchanged in New Zealand on account of the tax changes, spending on motor vehicles was significantly boosted in the month before the GST was introduced. This suggests that consumers may have been confused about the effect the reforms were to have on some prices. In Japan, by contrast, motor vehicle prices were expected to fall and some spending on motor vehicles was postponed. ", " The effect of the introduction of the GST on the timing of dwelling construction activity is more difficult to discern from the available data, in part because these data are inherently more volatile (Graph A2). In Canada and Japan it is hard to establish whether housing-related activity was affected at all by the introduction of the GST. In New Zealand, the number of dwelling approvals does appear to have been boosted significantly in the six months before the introduction of the GST, with approvals in the following <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span> being correspondingly weaker. Approvals of alterations and additions behaved in a similar fashion to those of new houses, as did approvals of medium-density dwellings. This bunching of approvals resulted in a significant increase in construction activity in New Zealand in the quarter before the GST was introduced, while activity was weaker than otherwise in the following quarter. ", " It is difficult to find evidence of the introduction of the GST having a significant effect on the timing of expenditure on most other components of domestic demand or on the aggregate level of employment in these countries. The employment data, in particular, do not appear to have been more volatile than usual around these periods (Graph A3), suggesting that it was widely appreciated that the observed effects on demand were likely to be temporary. ", " In summary, all of these countries experienced a boost to consumption expenditure in the quarter immediately prior to implementation of the tax, with the effect being broadly reversed in the following quarter. The overall effect on GDP varied quite widely across countries, and depended on the details of the tax reform package being implemented amongst other factors. Employment data, however, were little affected by these tax changes and throughout these transitional periods provided a better guide to the underlying strength of these economies. ", " Households in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom have all benefited from rapid increases in wealth during the 1990s, and particularly in the later years of the decade. In all three countries, household wealth increased at an annual rate of more than 10 per cent in the period from 1996 to 1999, contributing to the strong pace of consumption growth and supporting the overall growth of economic activity. The composition of the increases in wealth has, however, varied considerably across the three countries. ", " In the United States and the United Kingdom, the rise in wealth has primarily resulted from increases in the value of financial assets, and from rises in equity prices in particular. In Australia, while equities have been the fastest growing component of household wealth, they still form a smaller share of the total than in the other two countries. ", " The relatively low share of equities in household wealth in Australia partly reflects a lower market value of business assets, compared with the other two countries. The market capitalisation of Australian equity markets in 1999 was just over 100 per cent of GDP, compared with around 200 per cent in the UK and the US. In recent years, the faster increases in equity prices in the US and the UK have amplified the differences in the value of equity holdings among households in the three countries (Graph B1). Another factor is that net foreign ownership of Australian equity assets is relatively high; hence the share of business assets held by domestic residents, either directly in the form of equity, or indirectly through financial institutions, is lower than in the other countries. ", " Available data suggest that more than half of total household wealth in Australia in 1999 was held in the form of dwellings, compared with only around a quarter in the United States and a third in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United Kingdom</span> (Table B1). With house prices rising solidly in Australia during the past few years, increases in the value of dwelling assets have accounted for much of the increase in total household wealth. ", " The high proportion of wealth held in the form of housing in Australia does not appear to reflect significant differences in home ownership patterns among the three countries; most of the dwelling stock in each country is owned by domestic residents. Rather, the available data suggest a relatively high valuation of the overall housing stock in Australia. This may partly reflect differences in the type of housing, as well as differences in the value of and amount of land devoted to dwellings. ", " The differences in the composition of wealth among the three countries imply that recent share market fluctuations will have differing effects on the overall levels of household wealth. The direct effects of a decline in share prices on household wealth will be larger in the US and the UK than in Australia. In Australia, household wealth will be more sensitive to movements in house prices. ", " In recent years household borrowing to finance investment in the share market has increased. Some of this has been through personal loans and loans secured against houses and, therefore, the amount of such activity is not easily measurable. Some of the lending, however, has been more direct, taking the form of ‘margin lending’. Margin loans involve the borrower lodging cash or shares with the lender (typically a bank or stockbroker), which then supplements the investor's capital by providing a line of credit. This line of credit – the margin loan – plus the borrower's own capital are used to purchase shares, which then become the security for the loan. Margin loans have been available in Australia since the late 1970s, although they have increased strongly in recent years as most retail banks and larger stockbrokers now offer this product. ", " Margin loans outstanding from banks and brokers rose from $2 billion in September 1996, when the Reserve Bank began informally collecting this information, to $6.3 billion in the March quarter of 2000. Over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>, margin lending has increased by 50 per cent, although there are some signs that this growth might have begun to slow following the absorption of the <em>Telstra 2</em> sale. Interest rates on margin loans are currently around 8.4 per cent, about 0.7 of a percentage point higher than for a residentially-secured line of credit, but almost 2 percentage points below the interest rates available on other secured personal loans. Fast growth in margin lending over recent years mirrors developments overseas. For example, over the year to March 2000, margin lending in the US grew by 78 per cent. ", " While the recent rate of growth of margin lending in Australia has been high, the level of margin debt remains relatively low. The value of outstanding margin loans represents about 0.9 per cent of market capitalisation of the Australian Stock Exchange, around 1 per cent of GDP and 1.3 per cent of the household sector's gross liabilities. These figures are well below those for the US (Graph C1). The level of margin loans is not thought to pose any significant prudential risk to the individual lenders involved, or systemic risk for the financial system as a whole, given that they account for such a small part of total lending. Whether margin loans will adversely affect the share market in the event of a market correction is, however, less clear. ", " By leveraging their own capital with a margin loan, it is possible for investors to control a much larger portfolio than they could if they were to invest only their own capital. Leverage, however, magnifies both the potential gains and losses that might result from fluctuations in equity prices (see example below). ", " Financial institutions typically designate the range of securities which they are prepared to accept as collateral in order to limit their potential exposure to investors with margin loans. In Australia, lenders also typically limit the funding from margin loans to a maximum of 70 per cent of a portfolio of ‘blue-chip’ stocks; a larger equity contribution would be required of investors buying other securities. ", " Larger margin lenders in Australia say that Australian borrowers typically gear their portfolios conservatively, providing around 50 per cent of funds from their own resources. This operates to minimise investors' exposure to market volatility, particularly the risk of receiving a <em>margin call</em>. Banks and brokers make margin calls when falling share prices result in the market value of a borrower's equity falling below the minimum level prescribed by the lender (see Case 2 in example). ", " When a margin call is made, borrowers must restore, within 24 hours, their gearing to the ratio required by the lender. Borrowers can provide additional equity (in the form of cash or approved securities) or instruct their lender to sell some shares from the portfolio and use the proceeds to repay part of the debt. If they fail to take either of these courses of action, the lender has the power to sell sufficient securities to restore the required ratio. ", " Initial portfolio value: $100,000<br> Investor's equity contribution: $30,000<br> Margin loan: $70,000 <br> Maximum gearing ratio prescribed by the lender: 70 per cent ", " New portfolio value: $110,000<br> Gearing ratio: 63.6 per cent ($70,000/ $110,000)<br> Return on investor's equity: 33.3 per cent ($10,000/$30,000) ", " <em>In the absence of the margin loan, the investor's return would have been 10 per cent, the same as the rise in the market value of the portfolio. To the extent that the investor still has unused margin credit available, the investor could purchase up to about an additional $23,000 of shares, to restore the gearing ratio to 70 per cent</em>. ", " <em>This would tend to reinforce buying pressure in the market</em>. ", " New portfolio value: $90,000<br> Gearing ratio: 77.8 per cent ($70,000/ $90,000)<br> Return on investor's equity: −33.3 per cent ", " <em>With the gearing ratio exceeding the prescribed maximum, a margin call is triggered, with the investor required to restore the gearing ratio to 70 per cent. The investor could do this in one of three ways</em>: "], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2000/may/1.html"},

The United States economy has continued its exceptionally strong growth performance, while the recoveries which began in the crisis countries in east Asia last year have persisted, and in most cases strengthened. Prospects for the region will be assisted, moreover, by the expansion which now seems to be under way in Japan. The initial stages of the Japanese recovery were heavily dependent on public sector spending, but evidence is now emerging that private demand has begun to grow. In Europe, the degree of strength varies among the major economies, but all appear to be experiencing an upturn in growth. Recovery is also taking place, at varying rates, in Latin America. ", " As a result of these trends, which generally have been stronger than expected, estimates of global growth in 1999 have been revised up further since the Bank's August report. Prospects for next year are for better growth again, even taking account of the expected slowing in the pace of the US expansion. As of late 1999, the outlook for the world economy appears brighter than at any time since the Asian crisis broke in mid 1997, a distinct contrast to the situation a year ago. ", " This change has led to an increase in both short-term and long-term interest rates in most industrialised countries, as markets questioned the continuation of the accommodative monetary stance central banks have generally been following over the past year or two. The upward pressure in interest rates began in the US, the country most advanced in its economic cycle, but quickly spread to other English-speaking countries and, more <span class=\"no-wrap\">recently, to Europe</span>. Japan remains the exception to this pattern. Against a background of rising interest rates, share markets in most countries have been subdued, with share price indices down by 5–10 per cent from their recent peaks, and showing increased volatility. ", " The Australian economy has continued to record very good growth throughout the period of the Asian crisis and the ensuing global growth decline, despite export losses. A robust expansion in domestic demand has persisted, mainly reflecting the strength of household consumption spending. Some temporary factors, such as the receipt of proceeds of demutualisations and capital gains from privatisations, have contributed to that strength. But more general support for consumer spending is coming from growing incomes, sustained high levels of confidence, low borrowing costs and wealth gains across a range of assets. In addition, the housing sector seems to be gathering pace, after a flat period through 1998. Some further decline in construction spending by businesses is likely, but on present indications other areas of investment spending could grow through the next twelve months. ", " The improved external environment, together with ongoing strength in domestic demand, means that Australia's growth prospects have also improved. The prospective reduction in the Commonwealth's fiscal surplus <span class=\"no-wrap\">in 2000/01 is</span> also a factor that will, at the margin, support growth. For these reasons, it is now unlikely that a decline in overall growth, if it occurred, would be pronounced or long-lasting. The Bank expects that the economy will experience quite good growth over the next couple of years. ", " Inflation has remained well under control. It is, however, gradually moving higher, even though growth in labour costs has remained quite subdued, and is now running at rates consistent with the lower end of the target zone. The increase in the CPI over the latest year, at 1.7 per cent, has been held down by the effects of the health insurance rebate introduced in early 1999, which will cease to affect the measured inflation rate early in 2000. Abstracting from this factor, the rise in the CPI over the latest twelve months was just over 2 per cent. The rise in the price of oil which occurred during 1999 is pushing up the CPI, and changes in indirect tax rates during the second half of 1999 will affect the statistics during the December quarter. Various measures of core or underlying inflation, which are less affected by these temporary factors, are also gradually increasing, and over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year to September</span> were around 2 per cent. ", " By mid 2000, the Bank expects annual CPI inflation to be a little higher again, running at around 2¾ per cent. In the September quarter next year, the net effect of the implementation of the GST and the abolition of wholesale sales taxes will result in a one-time rise in the price level, and a temporary rise in the measured rate of CPI inflation, with the short-term effect likely to be larger than the long-run effect. By September 2001, when the short-term GST effect will have dropped out of the annual calculation, the Bank currently expects that CPI inflation should once again be between 2 and 3 per cent. This is based on the assumption that there will be no second-round GST impacts, via compensatory wage agreements or opportunistic pricing decisions. The Bank will be abstracting from the impact effect of the GST for the purpose of assessing the trend in inflation. It is important that those involved in wage decisions do likewise. ", " It is apparent that the stance of monetary policy in place through the past couple of years has assisted the economy through the period when the contractionary forces have been at their most intense. That this stance has been expansionary is clear not only from the levels of nominal and real interest rates, which for borrowers have been below the lows reached in the early 1990s, but also in the pace of credit growth, the run-up in household debt, and the appreciation in some asset prices. Other policy outcomes have been important, and some one-off factors also operated in the expansionary direction, but the lengthy period of low interest rates has been a major factor supporting growth. This stance of policy has also accommodated a gradual return of inflation to the target. ", " The economy is now, however, in a new phase. Over the past couple of years, the prevailing concern was to limit the risk of an abrupt decline in growth, and to facilitate a return of inflation to the target. Growth now seems secure, and the risk of a sharp slowdown has fallen considerably. The disinflationary forces seen over the past couple of years, both globally and domestically, are waning, suggesting that a fall in inflation back below the target is now unlikely. It was on the basis of this assessment of the outlook, the stance of policy and the change in the balance of risks, that the Bank recently decided in favour of a modest increase in interest rates, in order to move monetary policy to a less accommodating position. This was anticipated by financial markets, which had moved to price in a tightening, based on worldwide trends and the improving growth outlook in Australia. ", " The Bank's intention in making this adjustment is not to end growth, but to keep the setting of monetary policy attuned to the economy's changing needs. This will assist in further lengthening the current economic expansion, which is already the longest since the 1960s. A long expansion offers the best prospect for achieving a sustained further reduction in unemployment. ", " There has been a noticeable improvement in world economic conditions over the past six months. After slowing to 2½ per cent in 1998, world output growth is now forecast by the IMF to pick up to 3 per cent this <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Table 1)</span>. Such an improvement in world growth is a substantially better outcome than was expected <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months ago</span>. At that stage, world growth was expected to decline. The upward revision reflects not only the continuation of robust growth in the US, but also stronger than expected recoveries in Japan and Asia more generally. World growth is forecast to strengthen further in 2000 to 3½ per cent – the average growth rate in the world economy over the past 30 years. This pick-up reflects a continued improvement in growth in Japan and Europe, and the consolidation of the recoveries across Asia. It also incorporates GDP growth in the US easing back, although there are few signs of that happening at present. ", " Inflation remains quite low globally, although the turnaround in growth prospects suggests that the disinflationary forces that have been noticeable over the past two years are now gradually abating. A range of commodity prices have risen, as a result of both a firming in demand conditions and a curtailment of supply. Of these, the increase in oil prices is the most prominent. Since the March agreement between major oil producers to cut production, oil prices have risen sharply; in October the crude oil price averaged US$22.63 per barrel, up from an average of US$12.00 in February. This has led to increases in CPI inflation in most economies, reversing the effects of falling oil prices last year. ", " Economic activity in Japan has rebounded strongly from its trough at the end of last year, with GDP having increased by 2.2 per cent over the first half of 1999 (Table 2). While public spending increases were important in sustaining activity last year, stronger private spending, particularly personal consumption, has contributed the bulk of the increase in demand in recent months. ", " The increase in consumer spending reflects improved consumer sentiment over the course of this year and has been largely accommodated by a decline in the personal saving rate. Household income growth has been held back by weak labour market conditions. Dwelling investment increased strongly over the first half of this year, supported by low interest rates and government programs aimed at boosting the housing sector. Exports have benefited from rising demand across the rest of Asia. ", " Conditions in the manufacturing sector have continued to improve. Stronger domestic and foreign demand have boosted industrial production, with output in the September quarter increasing by 3.8 per cent (Graph 1). Firms no longer appear to be meeting the increased demand by running down stocks, and the Tankan survey reports that they expect business conditions to continue to improve. The survey also suggests a further easing of the strains in the financial sector, with firms reporting that lending conditions are becoming less restrictive. Despite these developments, a significant rise in investment seems unlikely due to the large amount of spare capacity. ", " The public stimulus associated with last year's fiscal package looks to be abating, with direct government spending subtracting from growth in the June quarter for the first time in a year. Recent data on public construction expenditure point to a further decline in the September quarter. The government is expected to release details of a new fiscal stimulus package in November. ", " Excluding the effects of the volatile fresh food component, consumer prices remain relatively stable. Earlier fears of a deflationary spiral appear to have been allayed, but with a considerable output gap to close, there is little prospect of demand-induced price rises for some time. ", " The recovery across non-Japan Asia that began in the second half of 1998 has continued this year. For many of these economies, GDP is approaching or exceeding pre-crisis levels (Graph 2). The exceptions are Indonesia and Thailand, where the financial problems have generally proven to be less tractable, and Hong Kong, where growth has been constrained by high real interest rates and the decline in asset prices. But even in these three countries, output has increased noticeably from its trough. ", " The main contributor to the recovery thus far has been the increase in domestic demand, particularly private consumption. Fiscal policy has been supportive of growth through both direct expenditure and indirect stimulus, including tax cuts and subsidised loans. To date, some of the increase in demand has been met by a rundown in stocks, but as stocks are now at relatively low levels, demand should increasingly be met through higher production. ", " After relatively subdued growth over 1998, exports are providing a larger boost to activity. This has reflected the rebound in intra-regional trade over the first half of this year, fostered by the pick-up in domestic activity across Asia, and also strong growth in exports to Japan (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). The upturn in global electronics demand has also aided the recovery in Asian exports – particularly in South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan, where electronics account for 20–30 per cent of production and 30–50 per cent of exports. In South Korea, while industrial production is now 16 per cent above its pre-crisis peak in September 1997, electronics production is 77 per cent higher; excluding electronics, production is just below pre-crisis levels. ", " The cyclical upswing in activity and the inflow of capital should assist in the restructuring of the financial and corporate sectors in the troubled countries of Asia. In general, structural reform has been more advanced in the financial sector, where financial institutions are being recapitalised and problem loans are being stripped from their balance sheets. Progress in corporate restructuring has proved harder: changes have been made to bankruptcy legislation, but corporate debt restructuring is proceeding only at a slow pace. ", " Consumer price inflation remains subdued throughout the region (Table 3). This reflects both the substantial excess capacity remaining in most countries in the aftermath of the crisis and also the stabilisation and, in some cases, appreciation of currencies over the past year. Inflation generally peaked during the course of last year and has since moved back to or below pre-crisis rates. ", " Having grown strongly in the early part of 1999, the New Zealand economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in the June quarter, reflecting a sharp fall in exports and weakness in private consumption. This was partly offset by a significant pick-up in stockbuilding and continued strong growth in interest-sensitive areas of the economy, particularly housing. Subsequent indicators suggest that the weakness in private consumption should be only temporary. ", " The United States economy is continuing to defy most expectations by growing at a pace somewhat above its longer-run trend, even taking account of recent upward revisions to estimates of this trend. Consumer spending continues to drive the expansion in domestic demand, increasing at a rate of almost 5 per cent a year for the past two years (Graph 3). Real household incomes have been increasing at a slower, but still above trend, pace of almost 4 per cent a year. The consequent decline in the measured household saving rate is, in part, a result of spending financed by gains in the stock market. The shift to budget surpluses at the federal level has raised public saving, so that the US national saving rate has been relatively constant in recent years. There have been signs of moderation in the housing sector. The increase of around 1 percentage point in long-term interest rates over the course of this year was associated with a fall in dwelling investment in the September quarter. At this stage, however, the slowing remains mild. ", " The pick-up in activity elsewhere in the world has been reflected in stronger US exports. Nevertheless, this improvement in exports has not been sufficient to curtail the rise in the trade deficit, as imports have continued to rise sharply with the strong growth in domestic demand as well as the increase in oil prices. This has resulted in an increase in the current account deficit to around 3½ per cent of GDP in the June quarter. ", " Higher oil prices have pushed up both producer and consumer prices in recent months, with consumer price inflation rising to 2.6 per cent over the year to September. Apart from energy prices, consumer price inflation has edged lower, to be 2 per cent over the year to September. Low overall inflation has, to a large extent, been a result of relatively subdued growth in unit labour costs. This, in turn, reflects ongoing restraint in wages growth, despite the low unemployment rate, and productivity growth that is unusually strong for this stage of the economic cycle. Changes to the method of calculating the CPI have also probably lowered the inflation rate a little over the last year. Looking forward, some of the factors which have held down inflation over recent years are no longer present, including the decline in import prices that was associated with the appreciation of the US dollar. ", " As noted in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-financial-markets\">International Financial  Markets</a>’, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in June and August, reflecting the improvement in international economic and financial conditions, as well as the persistent strength of domestic activity. In October, it announced a bias to tighten. ", " Low interest rates and the sustained strength of the US economy have led to robust output growth so far this year in Canada, with GDP growing at an annualised rate of 3.8 per cent over the six months to June. Economic conditions in many Latin American economies are continuing to improve. In Brazil, output increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.9 per cent</span> in the June quarter after a similar increase in the first quarter. In Argentina, after contracting sharply in the six months to March, the economy has shown signs of growth more recently. Nevertheless, activity there remains vulnerable to recent increases in interest rates needed to maintain the exchange rate peg to <span class=\"no-wrap\">the US dollar</span>. Mexico has recovered strongly this year, a reflection of its close ties to the US economy. ", " The pace of activity in the euro area looks to have increased in recent months, after subdued growth over the first half of this year. Export demand, which had been the main constraint on growth earlier in the year, has started to pick up. Reflecting this, and the continued growth in domestic demand, business confidence has recovered in recent months, with expectations about future business conditions being particularly strong. Conditions for consumer spending also remain favourable, with low interest rates and relatively high levels of consumer confidence, especially in France. ", " Growth outcomes continue to diverge between countries in the region. Output in the smaller euro area countries continues to grow at a fast pace, and growth in France has been slightly above trend over the past year. In contrast, Germany has been one of the weakest economies in the region, recording no growth in the June quarter, although there are a number of indications that economic conditions are now improving. ", " Consumer price inflation in the euro area remains low. The harmonised measure of inflation remains <span class=\"no-wrap\">around 1 per cent – as</span> it has done for most of this year – despite the recent increase in oil prices. Inflation remains somewhat higher in the smaller countries in the region, reflecting their faster growth. With the recovery consolidating across the region, the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points to 3 per cent in November. ", " Growth in the United Kingdom has picked up over the course of this year, following a period of subdued growth when the strength in the pound adversely affected the tradeable sector. Domestic demand, particularly private consumption, continues to grow at a solid pace, reflecting low interest rates and strong growth in household incomes. Conditions in the labour market remain tight. The Bank of England raised interest rates by 25 basis points at both its September and November meetings. Core consumer price inflation is just over 2 per cent, but is forecast by the Bank of England to rise back to the target of 2.5 per cent in two years' time. ", " The past six months have seen world financial markets continue to adjust to the passing of the financial and economic crisis that began in Asia in mid 1997. The sharp recovery in most emerging markets, particularly in share markets and currencies, that took place over late 1998 and into the first few months of 1999 has consolidated. But the impact of the changing economic outlook has spread beyond these markets to the core developed countries. With growth prospects for the world economy being revised up and inflation no longer falling, short-term market interest rates have risen on the expectation that central banks will unwind the accommodative monetary policy they had put in place over the previous year or two (Graph 4). ", " In the US, the tightening phase traces its beginnings to the May meeting of the Federal Reserve, where a change in view on the balance of risks to inflation was signalled with the introduction of a tightening bias. Subsequently, with continuing strong activity indicators, stretched labour markets and signs of possible pipeline price pressures (although core consumer prices remain benign), the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> to 5 per cent in June and then 5.25 per cent in August (Graph 5). And at its October meeting, it reintroduced a bias to tighten. The Federal Reserve has now reversed two-thirds of the cut in interest rates made last year in the wake of the Russian financial crisis. The Bank of England followed the Federal Reserve by increasing its official interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent in September, and another 25 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.50 per cent</span> in November. The European Central Bank raised official rates in November by 50 basis points, to 3.00 per cent, reversing all of the precautionary easing of last April. The Danish central bank also raised official rates in November, by 45 basis points to 3.30 per cent. ", " Japan remains an exception to this, with markets expecting that the Bank of Japan will maintain its very accommodative monetary policy (which involves cash rates of close to zero) for the foreseeable future. ", " Bond yields have risen in all major countries. In the US, they are up by about 180 basis points since their safe-haven related lows in October last year following the Russian default, the near collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, and subsequent problems in Latin America (Graph 6). In Europe, while the rise in yields was a little slower to occur, it has picked up pace in the last three months as signs of economic recovery in Europe have strengthened, and the net rise in yields from the early 1999 lows is now about 140 points. In Japan, bond yields have risen by around 60 basis points since late 1998, notwithstanding the accommodative monetary stance of the Bank of Japan. A factor pushing yields higher in Japan has been the large supply of bonds coming onto the market to fund the budget deficit. Notwithstanding this rise, bond yields in Japan remain at historically low levels, with 10-year yields at 1.8 per cent. ", " In credit markets more generally, perceptions that the interest rate cycle has turned, together with preparations for Y2K, have led borrowers to bring forward borrowing to lock in funding. The resulting increase in corporate bond issuance has pushed up swap spreads, with the spread on US 10-year (bank/government) swaps, for example, recently at its highest level for several years (Graph 7). ", " Higher bond yields have had a dampening influence on share markets around the world in recent months. In the US, the S&amp;P500 is about 4 per cent below its July peak, but the bulk of stocks in the index have fallen by significantly more than this as investors, possibly reacting to concerns that share prices are overvalued, have tended to move into the larger ‘blue chip’ stocks. More than half the stocks in the S&amp;P, for example, have fallen by 20 per cent or more from their peaks. Demand for ‘high-tech’ stocks also seems to have held up better than average. The Nasdaq share price index, for example, which contains a high weighting of such stocks, is around all-time peaks, and up over 35 per cent from its level at the start of 1999. In general, however, the US share market has become significantly more volatile in recent weeks, with daily price changes of 1 to 2 per cent becoming a regular feature. Inflows into equity mutual funds have slowed sharply. ", " Share markets in most other developed countries have generally followed the US lead (Graph 8). One exception to this is the Japanese share market, which has been stronger than markets elsewhere, driven by the sharp upward revision to the economic growth outlook for the Japanese economy. The Nikkei index has risen by more than 30 per cent in 1999, although in recent months it, too, has tended to flatten out. ", " Foreign exchange markets have been subject to strong pressures in recent months in response to the cyclical turnaround in Japan and Europe. The yen in particular has appreciated markedly as foreign investors have restored exposures after being underweight for some time (Graph 9). Japanese investors are also reported to have repatriated funds from offshore investments. Japanese authorities have been concerned about the effects of yen strength on Japan's emerging recovery and intervened a number of times, especially in June and July. The currency is now about 15 per cent stronger in net terms against the US dollar than six months ago and about <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span> stronger than the exceptional rate reached a little over a year ago. The euro has also been showing signs of strength since July, after falling consistently over the first half of the year. Its rise has coincided with evidence from the core European economies that economic growth has increased. ", " In emerging markets over the past six months, the general picture has been one of consolidation after the earlier sharp recovery. Markets in Asia have been fairly stable, although concerns that the pace of banking reform may not be sufficient led to a 6 per cent fall in the Thai baht in September. Much of this fall was subsequently reversed as the general run of economic news out of Thailand continues to be favourable. There was also substantial volatility in Indonesian markets, mainly reflecting political developments, but there was little spill-over to other regional markets. Another significant development was the announcement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority that it would start to dispose of shares it had purchased to support the market when it came under an intense speculative attack in August 1998. Shares purchased for HK$118 billion, have since increased in value to over HK$200 billion. Disposal of the shares will be by the sale of units in a trust set up to hold the shares. The initial public offering of units will be for HK$10 billion. ", " Periodic financial market disturbances continue to disrupt a number of Latin American financial markets, where recovery in growth is much more patchy than in Asia. Currencies in particular have been under pressure <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graphs 10 and 11)</span>. The Colombian and Chilean pesos were floated in September after periods of speculative <span class=\"no-wrap\">attack (although the</span> Colombian peso has recovered a little since), the Brazilian real fell on continuing budget imbalances and US dollar debt servicing and Ecuador's sucre has been under pressure following that country's default on some foreign debt and persistent domestic stagflation. While interest rates are well below their peaks in the recent crisis, they remain high in many Latin American countries. Stock markets are also off their peaks for the year. ", " The Australian economy has continued to grow strongly during 1999 (Graph 12). Real output expanded by around 4 per cent over the year to the June quarter, with continued strength in domestic demand offsetting the weakness in exports (Table 4). These figures record that for the past three years the Australian economy has been growing at above 4 per cent, and it is now in the ninth year of the current upswing. ", " Recent indicators suggest that private demand has continued to grow at a robust rate, with a pick-up in both consumer spending and housing activity, following an apparent moderation in growth in the June quarter. Latest data also suggest that the weak period of export growth, still evident in the first half of 1999, may have come to an end. This is largely a result of an improvement in Australia's external trading environment. Prospects are, therefore, that output growth will remain strong over the year ahead. ", " The pace of output growth in 1998 and 1999 has been sufficient to generate continued growth in employment. This has, in turn, boosted household incomes, and along with the high levels of household wealth and consumer confidence, it has established favourable conditions for continued growth in consumption. The business environment also appears to have improved over recent quarters, with most business surveys reporting an improvement in business confidence and expected profitability. Although investment has been weak, the investment intentions data imply that most of the decline in business investment has already occurred. ", " Over the first half of 1999, consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent, around the same pace as was recorded in the second half of 1998. Underlying these figures, however, was a decline in recorded consumption growth during the June quarter, affecting most categories of consumption. Some moderation was expected from the high rates of growth recorded in the previous few quarters, when consumer spending appeared to be boosted by the demutualisation of the AMP Society and capital gains flowing from the sale of the first tranche of Telstra. To some extent the June quarter outcome may also reflect difficulties with seasonally adjusting the data: the early incidence of Easter brought some sales forward into the March quarter, while the increasing popularity of mid-year sales has pushed some sales back into the September quarter. ", " Indicators suggest that consumer spending has continued to grow strongly in recent months (Graph 13). The volume of retail sales increased by 2.6 per cent in the September quarter, and by nearly 6 per cent over the past year. The strength of retail trade has been broadly based, with growth in some of the more discretionary items of expenditure, such as durable household goods and recreational goods, being particularly strong. ", " One important factor sustaining consumption in recent quarters has been the high level of consumer confidence. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment picked up through late 1998 and early 1999 and has maintained a high level since then (Graph 14). Consumers are now more optimistic about their situation than they were even before the onset of the Asian financial crisis. In recent months, consumers have become increasingly positive about economic conditions more generally, although they have become more uncertain about whether now is a good time to buy a major household item, possibly reflecting a degree of uncertainty about the net effect of the Government's tax changes on prices. ", " The one area of consumption that has weakened this year is sales of motor vehicles. Although competition between motor vehicle companies remains vigorous, registrations have declined by about 10 per cent since the middle of 1999 and are more than 20 per cent below the peaks recorded in mid 1998. In part this decline was expected, as registrations had reached a very high level in 1998. Some temporary decline during 1999/2000 is also expected by the industry on account of the introduction of the GST next year. ", " Consumption spending over recent quarters has been supported by continued growth in household incomes. Growth in household disposable income picked up steadily over the past year, driven by solid employment growth, to be running at just under 6 per cent over the year to the June quarter, the highest rate of increase for almost three years. Over the next year, income should continue to be supported by employment growth, and from <span class=\"no-wrap\">July 2000</span>, it will be boosted by the foreshadowed reductions in income taxes and increased transfer payments. ", " An additional factor explaining the continued strength of consumption over the past couple of years has been the strong increase in household wealth. In large part this has been driven by growth in share prices and house prices, although the demutualisation of the AMP Society and capital gains from the first stage of the Telstra float provided an additional boost to available wealth last year. In recent quarters, share prices have weakened, while dwelling prices have continued to rise steadily (discussed below). In aggregate, gross household wealth is estimated to have grown by 9 per cent over the year to June (Table 5). The likely effect on wealth of the Telstra 2 float is less clear, given the smaller discount given to retail investors. Nonetheless, the level of wealth relative to income has increased considerably in recent years, while the ratio of consumption to wealth has declined (Graph 15). This could support above average growth in consumption in the period ahead. ", " The strength of wealth and income, developments in financial products, low interest rates and high levels of consumer confidence have all encouraged further household borrowing. Annualised growth in credit outstanding to households increased to more than 15 per cent over the six months to September. It has been boosted in recent months by borrowing for purchases of Olympic Games tickets and Telstra 2 shares. Margin lending by banks and brokers for the purchase of shares by individuals has been growing strongly. Such lending has increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">38 per cent</span> in 1999, to about $5.2 billion. Although it is less than 2 per cent of total household debt, growth in margin lending has accounted for over a fifth of the rise in banks' personal lending (excluding credit cards) since 1996. ", " Continued strong growth in financial institutions' home loan commitments suggests that ongoing demand for new borrowing remains brisk. The average size of a new home loan has also been rising more quickly than average household incomes. ", " Overall, the ratio of household debt to the disposable income of households (excluding unincorporated enterprises) has risen by 12 percentage points over the past two years to 94 per cent (Graph 16). Continued strong growth in the household sector's assets, however, has resulted in the ratio of household liabilities to assets remaining roughly stable for the past few years. The household sector's net worth (assets less liabilities) remains at a high level. ", " The burden of interest repayments on household budgets remains at moderate levels despite the increase in household indebtedness. The ratio of household sector interest payments to disposable income has fallen steadily over the past year and is now below 6 per cent. This reflects borrowers switching from loan products with higher interest rates, such as traditional fixed-term personal loans, to products which attract lower rates of interest, such as home-equity lines of credit and other borrowing secured by residential property. Interest rates on specific loan products have been fairly stable over the past year, as discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic  Financial Markets</a>’. ", " Dwelling investment was relatively flat through 1998/99 after growing by almost 15 per cent over the previous year. Recent indications, however, suggest that housing activity will pick up over the year ahead (Graph 17). The number of private building approvals has risen by around 5 per cent since the March quarter, driven by strong growth in approvals for houses. The <em>value</em> of private building approvals has exhibited a similar pattern, although growth has been slightly stronger, indicating a rise in the average value of building approvals. Loan approvals picked up ahead of building approvals and have continued to grow strongly in recent months. ", " The level of building approvals is now considerably higher than commencements, which suggests that the industry is operating near full capacity, at least in some parts of the country. It also implies that there is some scope for building activity to rise from current levels. ", " The forthcoming introduction of the GST is likely to contribute to stronger housing activity in 1999/2000. The construction and sale of new homes, repairs and renovations to existing homes, and transaction costs (such as solicitors' fees) will be subject to the GST from 1 July 2000. While the wholesale sales tax on some materials used in constructing and finishing a house will be removed from that date, there is an incentive for some housing activity to be brought forward before the GST is introduced. This incentive has been offset for some households by the introduction of the First Home Owners Scheme, which provides a grant of $7,000 to households purchasing a dwelling for the first time after June 2000. ", " The strengthening of housing demand has been reflected in house prices. Established house prices, as measured by the ABS, rose by 2.3 per cent in the June quarter, and by nearly 6 per cent over the year. The REIA series which, unlike the ABS series, does not exclude the upper end of the market, but uses unmatched samples, rose by slightly less than 2 per cent in the June quarter and by just under 9 per cent over the year. Both series suggest that house prices continue to rise most rapidly in Melbourne and Sydney, where prices have risen by over 50 per cent and around 30 per cent respectively since mid 1996, according to the REIA data (Graph 18). Prices also seem to be firming in Perth and Adelaide. ", " The sustained strong growth in domestic demand in recent quarters has ensured that firms servicing the domestic market have enjoyed very favourable conditions. While the threat of competition from abroad has kept up competitive pressures in some sectors and margins tight, healthy growth in sales volumes has meant that overall profitability has been strong. For firms selling into overseas markets, conditions have been more difficult. This is particularly apparent in the performance of the mining sector. Nevertheless, the improvement in the outlook for world growth, particularly in Asia, has improved the prospects for Australian exporters. ", " The production measure of GDP increased by 0.2 per cent in the June quarter and by 4.2 per cent over the year to the June quarter. The low growth in the quarter came mainly from weakness in agriculture and manufacturing, both of which tend to be volatile. Most of the service industries, including accommodation, cafes and restaurants, communication, and transport and storage showed strong growth, and mining output grew for the second consecutive quarter. ", " Inventory accumulation picked up in the June quarter, although industry inventory-to-sales ratios do not point to any significant imbalances. Over 1999/2000, the ABS treatment of some Olympic-related expenditure is expected to boost the level of public authority stocks, and hence measured GDP growth. In the September quarter 2000, the Olympic-related stock build-up of the last four years will be unwound, offsetting part of the boost to growth of staging the Olympics. ", " Business surveys suggest that there has been a further improvement in conditions in most industries (Graph 19). According to the NAB survey, business conditions in the September quarter improved to be at their highest level since 1995, with businesses reporting stronger profits, employment and trading conditions. Current conditions are clearly better than average in the retail industry, consistent with the strength in consumption spending (as discussed above) and, while conditions in the mining industry remain lower than average, they have picked up noticeably over the past six months. Business conditions in the manufacturing industry have also improved, according to the NAB, ACCI-Westpac and Colonial State Bank surveys, presumably reflecting the improved prospects for manufactured exports. This suggests that the weakness in manufacturing evident in the June quarter national accounts data may prove temporary. The available measures of capacity utilisation indicate some increase in the past year, although utilisation remains, at this stage, below the peak recorded in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1990s (Graph 20)</span>. ", " The overall strength of business conditions shown in these surveys has for some time appeared at odds with a weakening of actual and intended business investment. After a number of years of strong growth, private investment expenditure began to level out in the first half of 1998, and it has since fluctuated around a broadly stable level in real terms (Graph 21). This weakening of growth in business investment was accompanied by a series of downward revisions to business investment intentions, as recorded in the ABS Capital Expenditure (Capex) survey, particularly in the second half of 1998 and in the March quarter 1999. ", " More recently, however, there have been some signs that the investment outlook has begun to improve. While the June quarter Capex survey still implies that the average level of fixed investment in 1999/2000 will be lower than its average in the previous year, the survey indicates that firms have revised upward their expectations since the March quarter – the first upward revision of intentions for some quarters. The survey also suggests that the average level of fixed investment in 1999/2000 will be higher than its June quarter 1999 level; that is, there will be growth over the course of 1999/2000. In that case, much of the weakness in aggregate investment that has been signalled in the intentions data may have already occurred. ", " The Capex survey points to contrasting prospects for the two main components of business investment. Investment intentions for machinery and equipment were revised up more strongly than the total, with the upward revisions spread across most industry groups. Assuming average realisation ratios, nominal machinery and equipment investment in 1999/2000 is expected to be 6 per cent higher than its June quarter level. In contrast, the outlook for buildings and structures investment is considerably weaker, with a further decline expected on the same basis. The latest Access Economics Property Monitor, however, shows a somewhat more positive picture for non-residential building activity, with fewer projects being downgraded than in the previous survey. Nevertheless, the listing of new projects has slowed. ", " The third component of business investment, which includes investment in livestock, investment in intangible fixed assets, such as computer software, and mineral exploration expenditure, has grown very strongly over the past few years. It now accounts for 16 per cent of estimated business investment, compared with 11 per cent three years ago. Strong growth in expenditure on computer software, which is around 70 per cent of this category of investment, explains most of this increase. Exploration expenditure, worth a little under 15 per cent, has been declining, consistent with the overall fall in investment by the mining sector. ", " Developments in the mining sector have had a significant impact on current and prospective investment trends. Mining sector investment comprises around 12 per cent of total investment, and this component fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">nearly 40 per cent</span> between its peak in early 1998 and the June quarter 1999. Although mining sector investment intentions improved a little in the latest Capex survey, they still imply further substantial falls in investment <span class=\"no-wrap\">during 1999/2000</span>. ", " The decline in mining investment has been, in part, a reaction to declining production and profits, caused by falling global demand and lower commodity prices during 1998 and early 1999. However, some contraction in mining investment was to be expected given the exceptionally strong growth that had occurred in previous years. Mining investment grew by around 18 per cent per annum in the period from early 1992 to early 1998, and as a share of GDP it doubled from trough to peak (Graph 22). Non-mining investment, in contrast, grew by 10 per cent per annum, on average, over this period, and as a share of GDP it rose to around its average level since 1980. ", " It seems likely that mining investment will reach its low point during the next few quarters. Using a five-year average realisation ratio from the Capex survey, mining investment as a share of GDP in 1999/2000 is expected to reach a similar level to that reached in the 1984/85 mining investment downturn. This would put investment expenditure around the level required to maintain the existing capital stock, and suggests that further falls in mining investment would be unlikely. The recent improvement in the outlook for world growth and the recovery in the prices of oil, gold and base metals, three sectors that comprise almost half of total mining investment, have contributed to an improvement in the mining sector's perceptions of business conditions and expected profitability. ", " Overall, businesses have ready access to funds. Aggregate corporate profitability remains at a high level, though the growth of profits as recorded in the national accounts has eased during the past year. Gross operating <span class=\"no-wrap\">surplus (GOS)</span> increased by 1.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter, with estimates of growth being revised downward to reflect new information on companies' accounting treatment of software. As a share of GDP, however, corporate GOS remains above its decade average. ", " External funding is also readily available. While business credit growth has fallen in recent months, this weakness has been partly offset by growth in alternative sources of business funding, and surveys do not report businesses being constrained by a lack of funds. The value of equity raisings over the first nine months of this year was around 60 per cent higher than for the same period last year. New floats have been particularly strong in recent months. The corporate sector has also re-entered the market for non-intermediated debt funding, with net issues of debt securities by the non-financial corporate sector averaging just under $1 billion per month in the nine months to September. So far this year, issuance is three times higher than in the same period last year. ", " Farm output is expected to increase modestly in 1999/2000 following a strong rise in 1998/99 of <span class=\"no-wrap\">around 8 per cent</span>. The prospects for wheat, canola, sugar and dairy are favourable, while meat, wool, cotton and barley production are expected to fall. Following an increase in wheat production in 1998/99 of nearly 9 per cent, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects to see a further rise in 1999/2000 of <span class=\"no-wrap\">around 4 per cent</span>, reflecting an increase in the area planted and favourable seasonal conditions. The strong growth of canola production results from farmers substituting away from growing other coarse grains in response to the higher returns on canola. ", " Following two years of historically high meat production, slaughter rates could fall by around 5 per cent as producers begin to rebuild herds. Improved prospects for economic growth in key markets – particularly <span class=\"no-wrap\">South Korea – have</span> seen some improvement in the short-term outlook for wool demand. However, wool prices remain weak and ongoing low returns from wool are likely to see farmers reduce sheep numbers further. ", " Employment growth has strengthened noticeably in recent months after a weaker period around the beginning of the year (Graph 23). Over the four months to September, employment increased by 120,000 – more than two-thirds of the total increase in employment that has taken place over the past year. Much of the recent increase has been in full-time employment, implying strong growth in total hours worked. The recent employment growth has been strongest in a number of cyclically sensitive industries, including construction, wholesale and retail trade. Construction employment has been boosted in New South Wales by increased demand for repair work arising from the hailstorm in Sydney last April, but also appears to reflect a more broadly based pick-up in housing construction activity in the September quarter. ", " Labour force participation rates have risen in recent months. In September, the participation rate increased to <span class=\"no-wrap\">63.4 per cent</span> of the working-age population, bringing it back to around the level prevailing a year earlier. The recent increase in participation has been associated with some rise in the measured unemployment rate, which had fallen unusually quickly in earlier months. Nonetheless, the overall trend in unemployment during the past year has been clearly downward. Unemployment averaged 7.2 per cent in the September quarter, compared with <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.1 per cent</span> a year earlier. ", " Current rates of economic growth are likely to generate further declines in unemployment in the period ahead. Forward-looking indicators of employment continue to record levels that have been consistent with a good pace of job creation in the past (Graph 24). According to the NAB survey, businesses' employment intentions are at their highest level for more than four years. The ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers recorded a substantial rise in employment intentions, suggesting firmer prospects in coming quarters. The job vacancy surveys conducted by the ABS and the ANZ Bank have again recorded new cyclical highs, with both measures increasing by more than 20 per cent over the past year. ", " There is a small amount of evidence that the strength of the labour market may be generating skills shortages in some areas. Skilled vacancies, according to the survey conducted by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, are at historically high levels. Over the past year, there have been significant increases in the number of vacancies in the construction sector. The NAB survey reports that the overall proportion of business respondents citing the availability of suitable labour as a constraint on current output and profitability has been increasing, although the survey still places labour availability well behind other constraining factors. The ACCI-Westpac survey also points to an increase in the number of respondents finding it more difficult to obtain labour; this is currently around the level reached at the previous peak in 1994. ", " Labour productivity rose by 2.1 per cent over the year to the June quarter 1999, and has maintained an average growth rate of 2.4 per cent during the course of the 1990s economic expansion to date. Despite slowing a little in recent quarters, as employment growth has picked up in response to earlier growth in output, Australia's productivity growth in the 1990s has been higher than in previous expansions. This outcome also compares favourably with that in the United States, often cited as an example of strong productivity performance at present. ", " Export revenues increased by over 6 per cent in the September quarter, after falling by 9 per cent over the year to June. While about a quarter of the increase in exports in the September quarter can be attributed to an increase in oil-related export revenues, the improvement generally reflects stronger demand for other exports from Australia's trading partners (Table 6). ", " Resource exports, which accounted for much of the weakness in export earnings over 1998/99, rose by around 7¼ per cent in the September quarter (adjusted for re-exports of gold), reflecting increases in both prices and quantities shipped (Graph 25). A large part of this rise in export earnings reflected the higher price of oil and the resumption of production at a number of oil fields on the North-West Shelf. Excluding oil, resource export earnings increased by around 3½ per cent in the September quarter. ", " Resource exports to most destinations increased in the quarter, but somewhat surprisingly given the rebound in their economies, exports to the initial crisis-affected economies fell and remain 5 per cent lower than a year ago. Looking forward, the outlook for resource exports is more favourable than it has been in the past couple of years. It is likely that growth in sales to the Asian region will increase as businesses in those countries meet further increases in demand by boosting production rather than running down stocks. The commencement of production at a number of large resource projects over the next two years should also provide a significant boost to exports of base metals and oil. ", " Manufacturing export revenues increased by around 4¾ per cent in the quarter, and are currently around <span class=\"no-wrap\">7¼ per cent</span> higher than a year ago reflecting solid growth in volumes to most destinations. Manufactured exports to the initial crisis-affected economies have risen by around 24 per cent from the trough in the September quarter 1998, while those to New Zealand – which account for around 20 per cent of the total – have also grown strongly. Exports to other east Asian countries have fallen by over 10 per cent over the past year, reflecting the economic difficulties in some of those countries in the early part of that period. ", " The value of rural exports increased strongly in the September quarter, with exports to Japan and other markets accounting for most of the gain. There was stronger growth in exports of most rural commodities. As was the case in the March and June quarters, wool growers have continued to take advantage of relatively favourable prices by exporting from their stocks. Beef exports also rose strongly, with increased demand from Japan and the US. The outlook for rural exports is mixed. While higher production of wheat, canola and sugar suggests higher export growth over the next year, the slowdown in slaughter rates for beef indicates some softening in meat exports. ", " Service exports increased modestly in the September quarter and are around 5 per cent higher than a year ago. Travel revenues have increased by around 6½ per cent over this period. The number of short-term arrivals has now fully recovered from the fall resulting from the Asian crisis, although the composition has changed (Graph 26). The share of arrivals from Europe and the US has increased significantly at the expense of arrivals from Asia. Arrivals from the initial crisis economies have recovered somewhat, but are still well below their levels prior to the crisis. Tourist arrivals from Japan have been on a downward trend since early 1998. ", " Following declines over the past three quarters, driven by significant price falls, expenditure on imports of goods and services rose by 6 per cent in the September quarter, to be 3½ per cent higher than a year ago. A large part of the rise in the September quarter reflected the impact of higher oil prices and the importation of a number of lumpy capital imports, including some civil aircraft and defence equipment. ", " In underlying terms, imports increased by around 2 per cent in the September quarter, with services and consumption goods imports accounting for most of the growth. There was a significant fall in telecommunications imports, which had grown by 70 per cent in the first two quarters, reflecting the purchase of communication cables for the worldwide upgrade of the cable network and the upgrade of the domestic network for the carriage of the Olympics. Mobile telephone imports have also risen strongly in 1999 as the deadline nears for the conversion from analogue to digital technology. Abstracting from these special factors, underlying import volumes have grown very strongly over the past year, reflecting the strength of domestic demand and significant falls in imported goods prices. ", " The current account deficit widened to 6.2 per cent of GDP in the June quarter as export values fell more than imports (Graph 27). The monthly trade data suggest that the trade component of the deficit widened slightly in the September quarter. Assuming the net income deficit remained unchanged, this would imply little change in the current account deficit as a proportion of GDP in the September quarter. ", " Net foreign debt liabilities fell by $6 billion in the June quarter – mainly a result of the appreciation of the exchange rate over the quarter – reducing the ratio of net foreign debt to GDP to 38.3 per cent. Interest and dividend payments both increased in the June quarter. The ratio of net income payments to exports increased <span class=\"no-wrap\">to 15.7 per cent</span> in the June quarter, from 15.0 per cent in the March quarter, but remains relatively low in historical terms. ", " In aggregate, commodity prices were little changed in the September quarter in SDR terms (Graph 28). There were increases in the prices of base metals and rural commodities of around 10 per cent and 2½ per cent, respectively, which were offset by falls in the prices of gold and coal. ", " The recent announcement by European central banks to restrict further sales of gold and the decision by the IMF to fund its debt-relief initiative with off-market transactions, contributed to a sharp recovery in sentiment in the gold market in late September; the gold price in US dollars increased by around 25 per cent in the wake of these decisions, but has since retraced about half of this rise. (See <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> for details.) ", " The price of crude oil (which is not included in the RBA commodity price index) has almost doubled since February (see <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a> in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#inflation-trends-and-prospects\">Inflation Trends and Prospects</a>’). Base metal prices are now over <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> higher than at the beginning of the year. This reflects ongoing cutbacks in production by high-cost producers and also the improvement in the outlook for world economic growth. The one exception is lead, where increased production in China has resulted in a substantial build-up in stocks, thereby limiting the price rise. ", " Significant increases in the prices for beef (9 per cent) and sugar (8 per cent) accounted for the rise in rural commodity prices in the September quarter. The rise in beef prices was driven by the recovery in Asian demand and herd rebuilding in Australia, which more than counterbalanced the expectation of large US supplies of beef over the remainder of 1999. The recovery in the sugar price follows its fall of around 50 per cent since late 1997. The medium-term outlook for sugar remains subdued with substantial stocks yet to be run down. ", " Short-term market interest rates have increased in recent months, first almost in a mechanical reaction to the tightening of US monetary policy – with markets anticipating that Australia would quickly follow its lead – and then as the market saw a more general case emerging for a tightening of monetary policy in Australia. The yield on 90-day bank bills had risen to 5.40 per cent in early November, 0.65 of a percentage point above the previous cash rate target of 4.75 per cent. With the tightening of monetary policy involving a rise in the cash rate of 0.25 of a percentage point, there was little further increase in bill yields. The yield on 180-day bills was 5.60 per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 29)</span>. ", " In addition to expectations about monetary policy, liquidity concerns of banks related to Y2K may have influenced the pattern of short-term interest rates in recent months. In most countries, a ‘spike’ has been evident for much of 1999 in expectations about the level of interest rates around the turn of the year. The ‘spike’ in expectations about Australian short-term interest rates is relatively small compared with those evident in other countries, reflecting a high degree of confidence among banks in Australia that liquidity needs have been well provided for. ", " As in other countries, bond yields in Australia have moved up in line with the changing world economic and inflation outlook. The yield on 10-year bonds was 6.60 per cent in early November, a rise of 1.1 percentage points over the past six months (Graph 30). This is a little larger rise than the move in US bond yields in the same period, resulting in a small widening in the spread to US bonds. Since early August, this spread has averaged about 0.5 of a percentage point, compared with an average of about 0.3 of a percentage point earlier in 1999 (Graph 31). The recent widening of this spread is, of course, much smaller than was seen in 1994 in the previous episode of globally rising bond yields, when the yield on 10-year bonds in Australia moved from 1 percentage point to <span class=\"no-wrap\">about 3 percentage</span> points above the comparable US yield. A number of factors have contributed to this better performance, including a notably stronger fiscal position, as well as greater confidence that monetary policy in Australia will be set to maintain a low rate of inflation. ", " Issuance of non-government bonds has been strong in 1999, with gross new issues of $24 billion in 1999 to date, compared with about $10 billion in the same period of 1998. In the year to October, the level of non-government bonds outstanding rose by around 50 per cent. As in other countries, credit spreads on non-government paper tended to widen in Australia in the middle months of 1999; the spread on high-grade corporate paper above Commonwealth Government securities roughly doubled to 0.7 of a percentage point. While strong fundamental factors are driving recent growth in the non-government bond market, some commentators have ascribed the timing of some issues to borrowers ‘getting in’ ahead of Y2K, behaviour which would also have contributed to rising spreads. The more recent narrowing of credit spreads might also be consistent with concerns about Y2K abating in financial markets, as participants have become more confident about their preparations (Graph 32). ", " The rise in short-term market interest rates ahead of the move in monetary policy had very limited effect on the interest rates that intermediaries charge for variable-rate loans, notwithstanding the fact that the marginal cost of banks' funding of such loans is related to bill yields. As this document was printed, intermediaries had not announced any changes in lending or deposit rates following the increase in the cash rate in early November. ", " There were some minor adjustments to standard variable housing loan rates in the September quarter, when four banks raised their rates by up to 10 basis points to 6.55 per cent, bringing them into line with those of major competitors (Graph 33). At the same time, some banks introduced a new product with a ‘honeymoon’ rate of less than 5.0 per cent for six months. The average ‘honeymoon’ rate, available for twelve months, increased by 45 basis points to 5.75 per cent. ", " Some mortgage managers raised their variable housing loan rate by 5–15 basis points, but these were still below those offered by banks. Generally, mortgage managers have absorbed much of the increase in bill yields into reduced interest margins even though they rely almost exclusively on funding in capital markets. This response reflects the ongoing competitive environment in the market for housing finance. Mortgage managers' share of housing loan approvals has recently tended to rise again, at the expense of banks. ", " Indicator rates on variable-rate business loans have been largely unchanged over the past six months, although the average interest rate paid by small business borrowers on variable-rate loans – which includes indicator rates plus applicable risk margins – has continued to fall. In the June quarter (the latest data available), the average interest rate paid by small businesses on variable-rate loans was 8.4 per cent. In the phase of easing of monetary policy which began in mid 1996, the average interest rate paid by small business fell by 4.2 percentage points, about 1½ percentage points more than the reduction in the cash rate. The contraction in this margin partly reflected the growing popularity of loans secured by residential property, which have a lower indicator rate than other loans and in most cases no additional risk margin. Competition in this market continues to intensify. One bank has introduced a small business loan secured by commercial property, reducing the interest rate at which such a loan would previously have been available from this bank, while another introduced a ‘basic’ residentially secured term loan for small business at 6.35 per cent, 40 basis points lower than that bank's standard residentially secured term loan. ", " In the case of fixed-rate loans, there have been some more noticeable rises in interest rates charged by banks, in line with rises in yields in capital markets. On three-year loans, interest rates rose by 0.75 of a percentage point over the past six months, to 7.5 per cent for housing loans and 8.0 per cent for small businesses. ", " Interest rates of intermediaries in Australia remain historically low, both in real and nominal terms, and by international standards (Table 7). Intermediaries' interest rates, both for the household and business sectors, are, for example, well below their previous cyclical lows. While the cash rate had been at the same level as at the previous low in 1993/94 prior to the move in monetary policy, intermediaries' rates were between 1 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ percentage</span> points lower both in nominal and real terms. These moves down were due to greater competition among intermediaries. In other English-speaking countries, interest rates that intermediaries currently charge businesses are generally higher than at their previous cyclical low point for the decade. ", " As in the United States, the strong rise in share prices in Australia came to a halt in April. Since then, the All Ordinaries Index has fallen by 7 per cent, a movement broadly similar to that in the US share market. For a time, share prices in Australia had performed more strongly than those in the US market due to the strength in prices of resource stocks (excluding gold producers), in anticipation of stronger industrial production globally and rising commodity prices (Graph 34). Since mid year, however, the prices of these stocks have tended to decline, capping the earlier upward momentum of the market generally. The price of stocks of gold producers fluctuated with the price of gold itself, first falling sharply, then rebounding on news of the plan of the European central banks to limit sales of gold, before giving up some of these gains as markets re-assessed the importance of this announcement. The price indices of shares of banks and other industrials are both down by about 10 per cent from their peak. ", " The market absorbed the sale of an additional 16.6 per cent of Telstra quite comfortably, with strong demand by households. The proportion of Australian adults now owning shares directly has reached a similar level to that in the US. ", " After rising from its late 1998 lows around US55 cents, the Australian dollar has been broadly steady since <span class=\"no-wrap\">April 1999</span> in a range of US63½ to US67 cents (Graph 35). Early in the period, talk of a bottoming in commodity prices and a more optimistic tone in world markets generally saw the currency rise to around the top end of this range on several occasions. This factor has continued to be supportive for the currency more recently, as has the sharp rise in the price of gold (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> in the previous chapter). But the tightening of US monetary policy (with the consequential negative impact on Australia's short-term interest differential) and the strengthening of the yen have worked in the opposite direction. In particular, the Australian dollar fell to around US63 cents by late August as investors moved out of the currency into the rapidly appreciating yen; the bilateral rate against the yen fell from 82 to 70 yen over the same period. ", " While the exchange rate against the US dollar has been on a flat trend recently, the trade-weighted index has shown a significant decline (8 per cent) since its July peak of 59.7. This reflects the fact that the US dollar has generally been weakening against other major currencies during this period, most noticeably against the yen. ", " With the exchange market stable, the Bank in its foreign exchange operations has followed its normal practice of covering the Commonwealth Government's foreign exchange needs in the market. Over the past six months, it has sold $2.5 billion of foreign exchange to the Commonwealth and bought a broadly similar amount in the market. There has, therefore, been little net change in net holdings of foreign exchange reserves, apart from valuation effects arising from exchange rate changes. ", " The gross level of reserves, however, has risen substantially over this period, from $24 billion to $30 billion, due to the use of foreign exchange swaps to manage domestic liquidity (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). This rise in reserves has been matched by a corresponding rise in the Bank's forward commitments to sell foreign exchange. ", " Credit growth slowed a little in recent months to an annual rate of 10 per cent in the six months to <span class=\"no-wrap\">September (Graph 36)</span>. Within the total, there has been a change in the mix of total credit growth between households and businesses. Credit provided to households has been accelerating through 1999, reaching an annual growth rate above 15 per cent over the six months to September (Table 8). In contrast, intermediated business borrowing has slowed, although, as noted in the section on the business sector, business funding from other sources continues at a strong pace. ", " Currency growth picked up towards the middle of the year before moderating a little in recent months. With annual growth at around 7 per cent, currency continues to increase faster than nominal household income and around the same rate as retail sales. Growth in the broader money aggregates also picked up in the middle of the year, but has subsequently slowed, reflecting fluctuations in the growth of corporate holdings of certificates of deposit. Fixed bank deposits have been fairly flat in recent months. Broad money and M3 grew at annual rates of 9.8 per cent and 11.2 per cent over the six months to September. ", " Funds under management increased by around 3 per cent in both the March and June quarters. Annual growth is well down from the peaks seen in 1997/98, but it is still much stronger than growth in household disposable income or bank fixed deposits. Net inflows of new funds have driven much of the growth in recent quarters, while valuation effects have been relatively less important of late, reflecting weaker share prices in Australia and overseas. Within the total managed funds sector, funds flowing into cash management trusts have been slowing in recent quarters and were flat in the June quarter. By contrast, net inflows were strongest into public unit trusts. Managed funds increased their exposure to cash and short-term securities and reduced their exposure to domestic equities and holdings of foreign assets in the June quarter, resulting in a more liquid portfolio overall. ", " Inflation remains low, but it has increased a little. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.9 per cent in the September quarter, up from 0.4 per cent in the June quarter (Graph 37). The year-ended inflation rate rose to 1.7 per cent, or 2.2 per cent abstracting from the estimated effect of the health insurance rebate which reduced the March quarter CPI. ", " Increases in petrol prices made a substantial contribution to the rise in the CPI in the September quarter. Petrol prices increased by 8.8 per cent in the quarter and contributed 0.35 percentage points to the increase in the CPI, following a smaller increase in the June quarter. The rise in petrol prices reflects the worldwide increase in crude oil prices since March, which reverses the decline in oil prices that had acted to reduce the CPI in earlier quarters (see <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>). ", " It is not only petrol prices, however, which have contributed to slightly higher inflation. Various measures of underlying inflation, which typically exclude the rise in the price of petrol, also picked up, to rates of <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 to 0.8 per cent</span>. These measures suggest that prices increased by around 2 per cent over the past year, a little higher than the inflation rates seen during 1997 or 1998 (Table 9). This pick-up was spread across many components, significant among which were house purchase costs and motor vehicle prices. House purchase costs increased by 2.0 per cent in the quarter and by 5.5 per cent over the year. These prices continue to rise more rapidly than building-materials prices, suggesting that profit margins and/or labour costs in the residential construction sector have increased in response to the recent strength in demand for residential construction work and the rise in prices of established houses. ", " Motor vehicle prices rose by 0.7 per cent in the quarter, the first increase for six quarters. Over recent years, motor vehicle prices have fallen substantially, and have acted to reduce both the CPI and underlying measures of inflation quite noticeably. These declines were led by prices of imported motor vehicles, which fell by more than 20 per cent between late 1995 and June 1999. Imported car prices rose by 2.5 per cent in the September quarter 1999, possibly reflecting some rebuilding of wholesalers' and retailers' profit margins. While the latest data show that imported motor vehicle prices have increased, weakness in demand in the run-up to the tax changes next year may place some restraint on motor vehicle dealers' ability to raise prices in the near term. ", " General measures of domestically sourced inflation picked up in the September quarter. Non-tradeable prices, a new category published by the ABS with the September quarter CPI, rose by 1.1 per cent in the quarter, partly reflecting the higher house purchase costs noted above. Private-sector services prices also increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.1 per cent</span> in the quarter and by more than 3 per cent over the year (Graph 38). Tradeable prices other than petrol were unchanged in the quarter. ", " Producer prices in the manufacturing and construction sectors also show some pick-up. Final prices of manufactured goods increased by 2.0 per cent in the September quarter. The increase in oil prices contributed more than half of this rise, but there were also some significant price increases recorded for other parts of the manufacturing sector. Excluding petroleum and coal products, final manufacturing goods prices increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.9 per cent</span>, the largest quarterly increase in more than four years (Table 10). In part, this rise reflected higher prices for basic metal products, resulting from developments in world commodity markets. With the exception of petroleum, the prices of inputs used by the manufacturing industry remained subdued in the September quarter. The Australian dollar price of many imported inputs fell in the quarter, in a lagged response to the exchange rate appreciation earlier in the year. ", " The prices of materials used in house building increased sharply in the September quarter, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. This is consistent with strong demand for house-building materials associated with the recent pick-up in activity in the housing market, as discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’. The prices of other building materials remain weak. ", " Between late 1998 and the middle of 1999, the Australian dollar appreciated by around 6 per cent, both in import-weighted terms and against the major currencies, retracing around half of the earlier depreciation. It has subsequently depreciated by around 2 per cent from its June quarter average level, but remains well above the level of late 1998. The prices of imported goods and services, recorded ‘at the docks’, have moved broadly in line with the rise in the exchange rate (with a slight lag), falling by about 6 per cent (excluding petroleum) between the December quarter 1998 and the September quarter 1999. ", " Assessments of the extent to which these price falls will be passed on to consumers at the retail level will need to take account of the unusual behaviour of import prices at the retail level in recent years. As noted in the Bank's August report, the recorded rise in import prices at the docks during 1997 and 1998 was not widely reflected in higher prices for imported items at the retail level. Rather, it appears that margins were compressed. If producers use the recent higher average level of the exchange rate to help restore those margins, then falls in prices at the retail level may not occur to the extent that would usually be expected. ", " Wages growth has remained moderate in recent quarters, and thus far provides little evidence of any increased pressures despite the stronger labour market conditions over the past year. The Wage Cost Index (WCI), excluding bonuses, recorded an average increase in wage rates of 0.6 per cent in the June quarter and <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.2 per cent</span> over the year to June quarter 1999 (Table 11). This rate of increase has shown little change during the past year. Aggregate wages growth continues to be stronger in the public sector than the private sector, although the difference has narrowed. The WCI for the public sector increased by 3.9 per cent over the year to the June quarter, compared with an increase of 2.9 per cent for the private sector. In part, this difference reflects the higher proportion of public-sector employees covered by enterprise agreements, as enterprise agreements have generally been yielding higher wage outcomes than other wage-setting streams. ", " Preliminary data indicate that average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) increased by 0.5 per cent over the three months to August 1999 and by 2.3 per cent over the year to August, after increasing at a similar rate to the WCI over the year to May. While the AWOTE figures, at face value, indicate a decline in wages growth, they have been highly volatile over the past couple of years and can be subject to significant revision; the latest quarterly data report a somewhat implausible decline in the level of male ordinary-time earnings and appear to be understating underlying wages growth. ", " Enterprise agreements, which cover around one-third of employees, continue to yield annualised wage increases in the 3½ to 4 per cent range. The average wage increase from new federal enterprise agreements fell to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.6 per cent</span> per annum in the June quarter, in part reflecting slightly lower outcomes in new private-sector agreements (Graph 39). The average duration of these agreements has shortened to just over two years. In the past two quarters, replacement agreements in the private sector have been specifying similar wage increases to those provided for by the expiring agreements they replace. This is in contrast to the situation a year ago, when the replacement agreements were consistently specifying relatively lower wage increases. The annual growth in executive salaries has remained constant in recent quarters, at around 4.7 per cent, according to the Mercer Cullen Egan Dell Salary Review. ", " Recent business surveys provide a somewhat mixed picture of the outlook for wages. The September quarter NAB survey finds that labour cost growth picked up to 0.7 per cent in the September quarter, although respondents expect it to return to around 0.5 per cent in the December quarter. The ABS business expectations survey suggests that the 12-month wage outlook remains benign. At the same time, most surveys find that businesses are intending to increase their employment further, and that some businesses are already reporting increased difficulty finding suitable labour, although this does not appear to have been reflected in wage expectations at an aggregate level. ", " Most indicators of inflation expectations have increased in recent quarters, with the increases being more pronounced for consumers and financial market participants. While much of the increase in inflation expectations reflects the anticipated one-time effect on the price level of the introduction of the major components of the Government's tax package in July 2000, part of the increase in these indicators appears to reflect higher expectations of ongoing inflation excluding the GST effect. ", " Households' inflation expectations over the year ahead, as surveyed by the Melbourne Institute, have shifted up from an average of 3¾ per cent in the second half of 1998 to around 5 per cent in recent months (Graph 40). The expectations of the survey respondents most likely to be involved in price-setting, namely professionals and managers, have shown a larger increase, which occurred mainly around the middle of this year; their inflation expectations increased by around 1½ percentage points between May and July and have since drifted up further to around 5 per cent, the same as the overall average of respondents. These increases appear to be related to the announcement of the tax package and the introduction of the major changes in July 2000. While the average expectation of inflation has clearly increased, the survey also points to a greater degree of uncertainty on the part of consumers as to how the tax package will affect prices in aggregate. There has been a marked increase in the proportion of households expecting inflation to be around 10 per cent, which is the rate at which the GST will be levied but takes no account of the effect of the abolition of some existing indirect taxes. There has also been an increase in the proportion of households expecting prices to fall, which may reflect the publicity attached to the prospect that the prices of some goods will be reduced by these tax changes. ", " Business surveys continue to indicate that firms are planning only moderate price rises in the near term, although surveys conducted during the September quarter confirm that the downward trend in business price expectations, evident for some years, has now halted. According to the NAB survey, firms expect to increase prices by 0.3 per cent in the December quarter, slightly higher than in the previous quarter. For the first time in a year, the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturing firms reported that more firms expect to increase rather than decrease prices in the coming quarter, and for the second consecutive quarter, the ABS Business Expectations survey reports a pick-up in expected price growth. In the NAB survey, medium-term inflation expectations of businesses have also increased slightly. ", " The inflation forecasts of financial market economists, as surveyed by the Bank, increased following the release of the September quarter CPI (Table 12). The changes to the forecasts for inflation over the years to June 2000 and June 2001 (excluding the effect of the GST) appear to reflect current and prospective developments in oil and tobacco prices as well as a modest increase in the assessment of underlying inflationary pressures. Some financial market economists have also revised up their forecasts of the likely first-year effect of the GST. Medium-term inflation expectations of financial market participants, as implied by the difference between nominal and indexed bond yields, have risen to around 3 per cent in October, from less than 2 per cent at the beginning of the year. ", " Trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), have raised their inflation forecasts for the year to June 2001. This partially reflects the view held by some respondents of a pick-up in underlying inflation, but it also reflects an increase in the number of respondents who have incorporated an estimate of the first-year effect of the GST into their inflation forecasts. ", " Australia has recorded an exceptionally good combination of strong growth and low inflation in recent years. The important foundations of this performance have been a much-improved trend for productivity, moderate growth in overall labour costs, increased openness to international competition, and the maintenance of low expectations of inflation across the community. For much of the 1990s, the fact that the economy had a good deal of excess capacity has also operated to make these factors more powerful in controlling inflation. ", " Inflation has, nonetheless, edged higher over the past year or two, with underlying measures having increased from a low of around 1½ per cent in late 1997 to around 2 per cent now. Part of this pick-up, especially in the most recent quarters, is attributable to the effects of strong demand in particular sectors. The most noticeable of these is the housing sector, where strong demand conditions over several years, and the emergence of capacity constraints in some areas, appear to be putting some pressure on prices. ", " Another part of the story is likely to be that with a stronger world economy, some of the international forces pushing prices down are now starting to weaken. The recent rise in oil prices, itself partly a reflection of stronger global economic conditions, has directly added to CPI inflation in the past two quarters and may have a further contribution through effects on business costs and price expectations. Prices of other commodities traded in international markets have also strengthened since the start of the year, and should continue to be supported by a stronger global economic outlook. ", " A continuation of these gradual trends appears to be the most likely outcome in the next several quarters. Prospects for global growth continue to be upgraded. Partly as a result of that, Australian economic growth now appears unlikely to decline much further. In fact, it is possible to point to factors that could easily result in an acceleration in output. With the economy now in its ninth year of expansion, having grown strongly for the past three years, the degree of surplus capacity has been declining. This suggests that remaining areas of downward domestic pressure on inflation are likely, at the margin, to weaken. ", " One area where there is no evidence as yet of increased pressure is wages, despite a noticeable strengthening of the labour market over the past year. The Wage Cost Index continues to record wages growth at an annual rate of around 3¼ per cent, and there has been little change in the wage increases being negotiated under enterprise bargaining, which continue to yield average annualised increases in the 3½ to 4 per cent range. These relatively moderate outcomes have been an important restraining influence on overall inflation during the past year, and they also point to the prospect of continued employment growth and lower unemployment. ", " Some increase in wages growth might, in due course, be expected in response both to the firmer labour market and the higher recorded price inflation now being observed. The extent of this is an open question, given the changes that have occurred in the labour market in recent years. It is also in this area that expectations of inflation could be important. The imperfect readings recorded in surveys suggest some rise in expected inflation, partly related to the anticipated implementation of the GST in July 2000. The GST will affect inflation only temporarily, however, and effects on wage earners will be offset by income-tax reductions. It is unclear at this stage whether expectations of higher inflation might persist beyond the period of the GST's impact, and to what extent they might serve as a basis for price and wage decisions. This is an area which will require close monitoring over the year ahead. ", " Overall, the Bank expects some further mild pick-up in recorded inflation over the coming few quarters. The CPI is expected to increase by around 2¾ per cent over the year to June 2000. This figure is a good deal higher than the 1.7 per cent for the latest year-ended rise in the CPI, but the pick-up includes the effect of dropping out the impact of the health insurance rebate, which reduced the CPI in the March quarter 1999, some further effects from past movements in crude oil prices, and an increase in tobacco taxes in the December quarter. Underlying inflation measures are expected to pick up more slowly, to a rate of around 2¼ per cent by mid 2000, and to around 2½ per cent during the following year. ", " During the 2000/01 financial year, the CPI will of course be affected by the tax package. Because the abolition of some of the indirect taxes will not take effect immediately, the short-term effect of the package on the price level is likely to be larger than the long-run effect. Measured on a year-ended basis, the rate of increase in the CPI will be well above the 2–3 per cent target from the September quarter 2000 to the June quarter 2001. As this results from a once-off tax policy change, the Bank will abstract from this direct effect of the GST for the purposes of assessing inflation outcomes relative to the target. On the assumption that there are no second-round effects of the GST, resulting from stronger wages growth, the year-ended CPI inflation rate is thereafter expected to return to the target zone, as the GST impact drops out of the calculation. ", " They would not sell any gold beyond already decided sales for five years. Such sales were said to be 2,000 tonnes, of which the Bank of England accounts for about 400 tonnes and the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Swiss National Bank 1,300</span> tonnes. ", " Sales already decided would be co-ordinated and spread over 5 years so that the amount sold in any one year would not exceed 400 tonnes. ", " Gold lending would not be increased. ", " proceeds of $7.0 billion from domestic retail applicants, spread out from late September to mid October; ", " proceeds of $3.2 billion from successful institutional bidders concentrated on 22 October; and ", " refunds of $0.6 billion of oversubscriptions to domestic retail applicants in the week commencing <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 November;</span> payment of refunds had the effect of returning liquidity to the banking system. ", " One of the major adjustments that the countries in non-Japan Asia have undergone in the past two years has been a significant shift in their current account balances. In the first half of this decade, many countries in the region ran sizeable current account deficits. Shortly after the onset of the Asian financial crisis in mid to late 1997, these current account deficits shifted to large surpluses (Table A1). In some countries, the size of the adjustment in the external position was as much as 10–15 per cent of GDP. ", " Much of the initial adjustment in these current accounts took place through a sharp decline in <span class=\"no-wrap\">imports (Graph A1)</span>, primarily reflecting the contraction in domestic demand in most of these economies. While import prices fell in US dollar terms, there was also a significant reduction in import volumes. Exports initially showed a small decline in US dollar terms, and little change in volumes. Some of this initial weakness in exports was caused by the substantial fall in regional demand (as discussed below), while some was attributable to supply-side factors, in particular the difficulty in obtaining trade finance. ", " Since mid 1998, the current account surpluses have narrowed in a number of these countries as spending on imports has rebounded, in line with the improvement in domestic demand conditions. In most of these countries, import prices have been relatively stable in US dollar terms since early 1998. More recently, export volume growth has increased, reflecting the pick-up in demand within the region and also stronger global demand for electronics (see main text). ", " The weakness in exports in 1997 and 1998 resulted mainly from the contraction in demand across non-Japan Asia and the depressed state of demand in Japan (Table A2). ", " Intra-regional trade accounts for one-third of non-Japan Asian trade. The fall in this trade between mid <span class=\"no-wrap\">1997 and end 1998</span> accounted for nearly all of the decline in exports in US dollar terms. Since then, stronger demand conditions within the region have seen intra-regional trade rebound, increasing in US dollar terms at an annual rate of 20 per cent over the first half of this year; only Indonesia and Hong Kong have not recorded an increase in exports to other countries in the region. ", " In the 18 months after the onset of the crisis, exports to countries outside the region declined only slightly in US dollar terms, and continued growing in volume terms. However, there have been significant shifts in the composition of external trade. A sharp fall in exports to Japan was largely offset by continued growth in exports to the US and Europe. Subsequently, as exports to the rest of the world have rebounded, the compositional change during the crisis period has partly been reversed; export growth to Japan has been particularly strong, reflecting the increase in private demand there, while exports to Europe have fallen. ", " While the decline in imports during the crisis period was evident in all markets, the subsequent recovery has been more uneven. Imports from other countries in the region have rebounded sharply, and, in particular, imports from Japan have grown strongly so far this year. Imports from Europe have lagged well behind the average. ", " The past year has seen large movements in the price of gold, falling to 20-year lows in the September quarter – following the commencement of a series of gold auctions by the Bank of England and discussions concerning the possible sale of gold by the IMF – and then rebounding to its late 1997 level, following the announcements by European central banks of a moratorium on further gold sales and loans, and by the IMF of an alternative plan to revalue its gold holdings without sales on the open market. At present, the price is a little over US$290 per ounce, about 15 per cent above the recent low point but about 30 per cent below the most recent peak of US$415 per ounce (Graph B1). ", " The sharp fall in the gold price over 1997 and 1998 seemed to reflect market concerns about possible official sector sales more than the sales themselves. During this period, the amount of gold sold by central banks was broadly in line with earlier years. There was, however, an increasingly prevalent practice of central banks making their gold holdings available for lending. As can be seen in Graph B2, since 1996 gold lending by central banks increased by a little over 1,000 tonnes to about 4,300 tonnes. Gold lending effectively facilitates additional activity by other market players, including producer hedging activity and short-selling by speculators. The activities of these players have had a significant role in the recent volatility of gold prices. ", " Gold producers often seek to protect themselves against variation in their earnings by hedging future production. This can be done through forward transactions or options, but either way the result is that the gold supply is effectively brought forward through a sale by the counterparty to the forward/option contract. This is because the counterparty to the producers' transactions will need to cover their position in the market, which is typically done by borrowing gold (usually from central banks) and selling it into the market. According to industry sources, producer hedging and the use of gold loans are estimated to have resulted in about 750 tonnes of accelerated supply to the gold market since the start of 1996. ", " Over the past couple of years, speculators have also used short sales of gold to obtain low cost funds to invest in other assets – for example, by shorting gold (borrowing it and selling it in the spot market), market participants have been able to obtain US dollars at between 1 and 2 per cent, well below the rate of return available on US assets. Selling gold short has therefore been an alternative to the ‘yen-carry’ trade which saw market participants fund investments in various markets by borrowing yen (at almost zero cost due to the low interest rates in Japan) and selling it for other currencies, mostly US dollars. Although short-sellers ran the risk of a rise in the gold price, this risk had been judged to be low in a climate of generally negative sentiment towards gold. ", " Much of this activity takes place in over-the-counter markets, rather than on exchanges, so figures are difficult to come by. The only indication of the scale of speculative short-selling on these markets comes from statistics on the gold lending market, which short-sellers must use to fund their sales. Since the beginning of 1996, gold loans to speculators are estimated to have increased by about 350 tonnes. ", " With 25 per cent of all above ground gold stocks held by central banks, any increase in demand for borrowed gold by short-sellers has been easily met by an increase in central bank lending. Whereas in most markets an increase in short-selling puts pressure on the lending market and pushes up the interest rate at which short-sellers can borrow the underlying stock, the ready supply of gold loans from central banks seeking to earn some return on their gold holdings has, until recently, helped to keep lease rates low, generally in the range of 1–2 per cent (Graph B3). ", " In late September, a group of 15 European central banks (including the Bank of England) announced that: ", " This caused an important structural change in the gold market. The prospect of reduced central bank sales removed the downward pressure on the gold price, while the proposed cap on gold lending pushed up lease rates. Both factors worked to make the ‘gold-carry’ trade unattractive. As such, the announcement led to extensive buying as speculators rushed to cover short positions. There was also some unwinding of hedges by producers. Lease rates spiked to almost 10 per cent before settling around 2–3 per cent, and the price of gold rose to as high as US$340 per ounce, before falling back under US$300 per ounce. ", " The payments associated with the privatisation of a further 16.6 per cent of Telstra had a substantial impact on flows of liquidity in the money market in October, and therefore were an important consideration in the Bank's market operations. ", " As retail and institutional investors paid for the first instalment of their subscriptions, $9.6 billion was withdrawn from the money market as banks transferred the funds to the Commonwealth's account at the Reserve Bank. There were three groups of flows (see Graph C1): ", " Through this period other influences added about $2 billion, in net terms, to money market liquidity, so that overall, in the period in which Telstra 2 was settled, there was a drain of about $7.6 billion of liquidity from the market. These influences are summarised in Table C1. ", " Such large aggregate flows through the system required commensurately large offsetting operations by the Reserve Bank to maintain system liquidity. ", " In providing this liquidity, the Bank relied to a greater degree than usual on foreign exchange swaps to supplement outright transactions in CGS and repurchase agreements (repos). Foreign exchange swaps are similar to repurchase agreements, except they involve the exchange of cash for foreign currency rather than securities. Under the swaps in question, the first leg involved the Bank exchanging Australian dollars for foreign currency (thereby adding to the supply of Australian dollars in the money market) with the transactions to be reversed in the second leg, which in most cases is scheduled for the first quarter of 2000 (though some swaps may, of course, be rolled forward). ", " After allowing for operations to shift funds within the period, the Bank accommodated the net outflow by undertaking an additional $1.6 billion of repos (increasing its repo book to about $7 billion) and $5 billion in foreign exchange swaps. The remainder was undertaken through outright purchases of CGS. ", " The increased use of foreign exchange swaps has lifted the Bank's outstanding forward foreign exchange commitments to about $16 billion. This rise was matched by a counterpart rise in the Bank's holdings of foreign assets, and therefore had no effect on the Reserve Bank's net foreign reserves position. ", " The Bank has used foreign exchange swaps to manage domestic liquidity at various times in the past, though their use on this occasion was heavier than usual, for two reasons. First, as the Government has been running budget surpluses, the stock of CGS outstanding has fallen. Exclusive reliance on transactions in CGS – either as outright purchases or via repos – to provide liquidity on the scale required for settlement of Telstra 2 could have caused distortions in the CGS market itself or in the repo market. Second, the Bank is also aware that preparations for Y2K could see banks' demand for liquidity rise, perhaps substantially. In that context, the relative reliance on foreign exchange swaps to manage the liquidity implications of Telstra 2 leaves a larger pool of CGS available to banks to manage their liquidity as Y2K approaches. This will also provide greater operational flexibility to the Reserve Bank through this period. It is possible also that the Bank will continue to rely to a greater extent than normal on foreign exchange swaps to provide system liquidity ahead of Y2K. ", " Oil prices have fluctuated widely in recent years. Since early 1999 the price of crude oil has nearly doubled to over US$20 a barrel, returning oil prices to around their most recent peak, recorded in <span class=\"no-wrap\">January 1997</span> (Graph D1). This sharp increase is around the same size as the increase that occurred in 1990, as a result of the Gulf War, but is considerably smaller than the increases that occurred in the 1970s. In real terms oil prices remain quite low, around the average level recorded since the mid 1980s. ", " Both the cycle in world demand and variations in global oil production have contributed to the fluctuations in oil prices over the past three years. Since March 1998, oil-producing countries have been making efforts to restrict supply, but it was not until early in 1999, when world demand for oil began to pick up, that these efforts were successful. In March 1999, several oil-producing countries met and agreed to restrict the output of their state-owned oil companies, and in September they agreed to maintain these production restrictions. The effectiveness of these supply restrictions is evident in the sharp increase in oil prices that has occurred since March. ", " Changes in the price of crude oil affect domestic inflation directly, via their effect on the retail price of petrol, and indirectly, via increases in production costs more generally and increases in the prices of substitute goods. ", " The direct effect of increases in crude oil prices on inflation is easily identified. Increases in crude oil prices are first reflected in the refined petroleum price, and then in the retail price for petrol. Retail petrol prices have a weight of 4 per cent in the current Consumer Price Index (CPI). Pass-through of changes in crude oil prices to retail petrol prices occurs rapidly, with most changes being fully passed through within six <span class=\"no-wrap\">months (Graph D2)</span>. The total percentage change in the retail petrol price, however, is always much smaller than the percentage change in the crude oil price. This is mainly because Federal and State excise taxes, which are levied per litre of petrol sold, account for a substantial proportion of the retail petrol price. (The excise rate is currently 43.5 cents per litre for unleaded petrol.) Other costs involved in wholesaling and retailing petrol, such as wages, storage and transportation costs, are also significant; movements in these costs are fairly stable over time. Overall, this implies that only 20 to 30 per cent of the retail price of petrol is directly dependent on the price of crude oil. ", " Between early 1997 and early 1999, crude oil prices fell by around A$13.50 per barrel. This contributed to an 11 per cent fall in retail petrol prices, and reduced the headline CPI by 0.5 per cent. Since early 1999, crude oil prices have risen by around A$16.00 per barrel and retail petrol prices have risen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">17 per cent</span>. Based on past relationships, and assuming crude oil prices remain around the October average level, this increase in crude oil prices would directly increase the CPI by a little over 0.6 per cent. Most of this has been captured in the June and September quarterly movements in the CPI. ", " The indirect effect of higher oil prices on inflation is more difficult to identify and quantify. At an aggregate level, it is difficult to discern the effect of movements in oil prices on the underlying price level, although some effect on the energy-intensive components of the CPI, such as transportation and travel, can be found. The prices of other sources of energy, such as coal and gas, also appear to be affected by oil price movements, though these relationships are quite loose, and depend on the state of world demand and stock levels. There is some evidence that higher oil prices have begun to contribute to higher production costs in some industries. The cost of materials used in manufacturing, for example, increased by 3.9 per cent between the March and September quarters 1999, largely reflecting the pick-up in oil prices. The latest NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys also point to a modest increase in both actual and expected production costs. In the NAB survey, increases in production costs were strongest in the transport, storage and communications sector and the mining sector, both of which are relatively energy intensive.

In line with the strength of the economy, employment growth has been strong, and unemployment has fallen. At the same time, inflation has picked up, measured either by the CPI or the various underlying measures. ", " Growth of the Australian economy is being supported by a strong external environment at present and, if anything, global economic conditions have strengthened further in recent months. In the United States, where many observers had been expecting some slowing, growth remained strong in the first half of 2000, while growth in the other major regions has been decidedly firmer. The Japanese economy, which has been the weakest of the major economies in recent years, is now showing signs of recovery. The main uncertainties in the global environment concern the United States, where some slowing in activity is widely expected, and Japan, where the strength and durability of the economic recovery remain uncertain. Nonetheless, the overall condition of the global economy represents an environment that is highly favourable to growth in Australia, with global growth in 2000 likely to be the highest it has been for several years. Growth in Australia's export income over the past year was nearly 30 per cent, a pace which has rarely been exceeded in the past four decades. ", " It had been expected that as external demand strengthened, domestic spending growth would decline. Several indicators suggested that some areas of private demand had begun to slow in the first half of 2000. But overall demand growth has remained quite strong, boosted to some extent by temporary pre-GST spending, and by public-sector expenditure which, at least as recorded in the national accounts, has also expanded quite quickly. Consistent with this, spending on imports has increased strongly over the past year. The net result is that the broadest economy-wide indicators of activity – GDP and employment growth – have continued to show an economy that is quite robust. This has generated a continuing decline in unemployment, bringing the unemployment rate down to around 6¾ per cent in recent months, its lowest level for a decade. ", " With the implementation of major changes to tax arrangements from 1 July, a number of economic indicators have already become more difficult to interpret over short periods, and this will continue in the months ahead. The introduction of the GST is likely to have shifted a significant volume of housing activity from the second half to the first half of the year. This is already evident in the recent sharp declines in the forward indicators of housing activity after the strength recorded earlier in the year. There was also a very large boost to some areas of retail spending in June which is likely to be followed by a couple of weaker months. Working in the other direction, some business investment spending may have been deferred to the second half of the year to benefit from the more favourable tax treatment under the new system. ", " Leaving aside these short-term influences, conditions at present appear conducive to continued strong growth. Exports are increasing rapidly, reflecting the favourable international environment as well as the boost being given by current levels of the exchange rate. This in turn is feeding into growth in domestic incomes. Corporate profitability is high, and businesses have ready access to funding, providing a favourable environment for investment. Developments in household income and wealth remain supportive of consumer spending, and the substantial income tax cuts and increases in government benefit payments implemented recently will provide further support in that area. ", " Notwithstanding the recent increases in interest rates, the stance of monetary policy is not unduly restricting growth at present. Real interest rates could not be considered high judged by any previous comparable period, and credit has continued to expand rapidly, with the pace of credit growth increasing further in recent months. Strong demand for credit has been particularly evident in the household sector, where debt levels in aggregate have increased by more than 17 per cent over the past year. While such a rate of expansion will clearly not be sustainable in the longer run, there is little sign at this stage that the appetite for borrowing has been restrained by the recent increases in interest rates, even though the higher debt burden of households might be expected to make them more responsive to interest rate changes. ", " There has been a gradual increase in inflationary pressures during the past year. The CPI rose by 3.2 per cent over the year to June, slightly above the target for CPI inflation of 2–3 per cent. The large CPI rise was partly attributable to some temporary or industry-specific factors, most notably higher international oil prices. Temporary departures from the target inflation rate of this nature are acceptable, as Australia's flexible inflation targeting policy is specifically designed to cater for volatility in the CPI. Various core measures of inflation point also to a gradual increase. These measures suggest core inflation is currently running at around 2½ per cent, compared with around 1½ per cent a year ago. Upstream price indicators are also indicative of an increase in inflation pressures, in part reflecting the depreciation of the exchange rate since late 1999. Some of these cost increases have probably not yet been reflected in final consumer prices. ", " Price data will become more difficult to interpret in the period ahead because of the significant impact that the changes to tax arrangements are likely to have on the CPI. These will have their main impact in the September quarter but it will be some time before the CPI, or underlying inflation measures based on the CPI, will provide a clear reading of annual inflation unaffected by the tax changes. The Bank has signalled its intention to abstract from these tax effects, and monetary policy will seek to ensure that ongoing inflation excluding the tax effects remains consistent with the target. This will require careful judgments to be made as to the respective contributions of tax effects and ongoing inflation to CPI movements in the quarters ahead. In assessing the inflation outlook the Bank continues to assume that there will be no significant second-round effects on wages and prices flowing from the implementation of the GST. Prospects for avoiding such second-round effects appear to be good at this stage. The Bank's current assessment is that inflation (excluding tax effects) is likely to be in the upper part of the target zone over the next four to six quarters, though inflation risks overall are tilted somewhat to the upside. ", " Monetary policy has responded to the changing balance of risks to economic activity and inflation, increasing the cash rate in five steps since last November, the most recent of these being in early August. The Board's assessment throughout this period has been that, with strong growth, a gradual increase in underlying inflation, and firming demand for credit, interest rates needed to rise to lessen the risks of higher inflation in the future. The structure of market interest rates has reflected market participants' changing perceptions of the likely course of the economy and of monetary policy's response to it. In the most recent period, following the tightening of monetary policy in May, market interest rates declined for a time as participants assessed that the cumulative tightening over the previous six months might have been sufficient to reduce the risks on inflation. But, in July, this view began to change. With data on economic activity and, more importantly, inflationary pressures on the high side of expectations, market interest rates moved up as participants became conscious of the inflation risks and began to price-in the possibility of a further tightening of monetary policy. By the time of the Bank's early August policy announcement, markets had priced into short-term yields about a 50 per cent probability of a change in policy that month, and close to 100 per cent by the following month. The announcement caused a further modest rise in market yields, and some increase in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar; the share market did not seem to be much affected. Most banks responded soon after with increases in their main lending rates similar to the rise in the cash rate. ", " Under the inflation targeting framework, the objective of monetary policy remains to contain inflation in the medium term, thereby ensuring one of the pre-conditions for the economy to attain its maximum sustainable growth. In the period ahead, the Bank will continue to evaluate incoming data, with a view to assessing the evolution of the economy and the risks to the outlook. ", " The United States economy maintained considerable momentum over the first half of 2000. Real GDP increased by 1.3 per cent in the June quarter, to be 6 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 1). The pick-up in growth over the past year has been driven by a marked increase in domestic final demand. Growth in consumer spending, while remaining high, has softened a little, and growth in residential investment spending has slowed, but these have been more than offset by an acceleration in business investment and government spending. Although export growth has also strengthened over this period, it has been roughly matched by a pick-up in import growth. ", " The key question is whether the economy will slow substantially during the second half of the year. Some slowing has been expected, on account of the tightening in financial conditions which has taken place since the middle of last year. To date, the Federal Reserve has increased the Federal funds rate by 175 basis points in this tightening phase, and recent evidence from the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers suggests that lenders are also becoming somewhat more cautious about extending credit to businesses. There has also been some softening in the share market, particularly for technology stocks; the S&amp;P 500 index is currently around 5 per cent below the peak levels reached in March, and the NASDAQ is currently 21 per cent lower. ", " Overall, however, evidence that the tighter financial conditions are restraining growth is only gradually emerging. It is clearest in the housing sector: housing starts turned down some months ago, and imply that residential investment is likely to fall in the second half of this year. Business sentiment, according to the National Association of Purchasing Managers' survey, has also deteriorated and recent monthly data suggest that underlying employment growth has moderated a little. Although consumption growth slowed back towards trend in the June quarter, it is not yet clear that this slower pace will be sustained. Consumer confidence remains at historically high levels, household income growth remains robust and the level of household wealth relative to current incomes is still high, even given the recent developments in the share market. Aggregate credit growth also remains strong for both the household and business sectors, suggesting that financial conditions are not yet particularly restrictive. ", " Over the past decade, growth in business fixed investment has outpaced that of the economy more generally <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 2)</span>. This has been driven by a rapid expansion in equipment investment, which in turn has been driven by the adoption of information technology (computers and software) by businesses, and is arguably one of the factors behind the US economy's recently improved productivity performance. Looking ahead, if businesses expect that the productive gains arising from investing will continue to outweigh the higher cost of financing, investment may continue to grow strongly. ", " The evidence is clear, however, that underlying inflation has picked up. Core consumer price inflation has risen to around 2½ per cent, from the 2 per cent rate that prevailed through the second half of last year, although it does not appear to be increasing further at this stage. CPI inflation is running noticeably faster than this, <span class=\"no-wrap\">at 3.7 per cent</span>, having been boosted by higher oil prices. Several of the favourable developments that helped restrain inflation over the past few years are now dissipating. Following a four-year period of decline, non-oil import prices increased by 1.1 per cent over the year to June and wages growth now looks to have passed its trough. The Employment Cost Index rose by 1 per cent in the June quarter and has increased by 4.4 per cent over the past year, driven by a particularly strong increase in growth in the private sector component. Productivity, however, continues to post solid gains, increasing by 5.2 per cent over the year to the June quarter, and will help to contain growth in unit labour costs. ", " Japanese GDP grew strongly in the March quarter, increasing by 2.4 per cent. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by private spending, with consumption, housing and business investment all rising strongly. Public spending continued to fall in the March quarter, but the fiscal stimulus announced last November is likely to boost growth in coming quarters. ", " Although the national accounts data have been volatile over recent quarters, a range of indicators suggest that activity is improving gradually. The pick-up in consumption in the March quarter appears to be continuing and is being supported by further increases in consumer confidence; household spending increased by 2½ per cent in the June quarter and consumer confidence is now at its highest level in 4 years (Graph 3). Business confidence also strengthened in the June quarter according to the <em>Tankan</em> survey, and firms expect this trend to continue into the second half of the year. The improvement in confidence has been greatest for manufacturing firms, which have benefited from the strong pick-up in external demand: exports increased by 8 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>. Manufacturers have thus progressively revised up their investment intentions, and are now looking to increase investment in the year to March 2001 for the first time in two years. In comparison, non-manufacturing firms still expect to reduce their investment spending over this period. ", " These improved demand conditions have been reflected in the output data. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's index of overall business activity consolidated its strong increase in the March quarter, and increased by 2.3 per cent over the year to May. Both industrial production and service sector output contributed to this increase, continuing the positive trends prevailing since early last year. ", " While the prospects for the Japanese economy appear to be improving, some short-term risks to the recovery remain. Despite recent strength, consumer demand is perhaps the greatest area of uncertainty, and the weakness of labour market conditions will not help in this regard. Wages growth remains weak and employment is 0.2 per cent lower than a year ago. Evidence from the <em>Tankan</em> survey indicates that while there has been some improvement in firms' hiring intentions, firms still perceive current employment levels to be excessive. ", " Consumer prices continue to fall, and are 0.7 per cent lower than a year ago. While the sizeable output gap has significantly contributed to this outcome, other factors have also been important: non-oil import prices have been declining (in line with the exchange rate appreciation), deregulation in the service sector has dampened prices, and food prices have been lowered by favourable weather conditions. Higher oil prices have partly offset these factors. ", " Activity in non-Japan Asia remained strong during the first half of 2000, though the pace of growth varied widely across countries; over the past year, growth has been strongest in Hong Kong, Korea and Malaysia and weakest in Indonesia (Table 1). Until recently, the growth in output in the region was driven primarily by the external sector. Strong export growth has continued, but there has also been a pick-up in domestic demand in a number of economies in the region, reflecting increases in both consumer spending and, in a few cases, investment <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 4)</span>. Domestic demand has been supported by an improvement in labour market outcomes, with unemployment generally falling across the region. ", " Through most of this recovery, the weakest component of demand in non-Japan Asia has been investment. This has particularly been the case in those countries that were worst hit by the Asian crisis, such as Indonesia and Thailand. More recently, however, investment has rebounded sharply in several countries. While construction investment continues to be weighed down by the ongoing weakness in property markets throughout the region, the strength in the region's exports has led to the need for increased equipment investment in export-focused industries, despite the existence of excess capacity in other sectors. ", " Export growth has been driven by the ongoing strength in world demand, as well as the rebound in domestic demand within the region, as noted above. While exports to all major destinations have grown solidly, <span class=\"no-wrap\">intra-regional</span> trade and exports to Japan have increased particularly strongly of late. Export growth has also been fairly broadly based across all major categories of goods, although electronics exports remain especially strong. ", " Despite the increase in world oil prices, consumer price inflation in non-Japan Asia remains subdued, with inflation at or below 2 per cent in most countries, a good deal below pre-crisis rates (Graph 5). This has enabled monetary policies to remain generally supportive of growth. ", " While significant progress has been made on financial restructuring in the crisis-affected countries, much work remains to be done. Significant amounts have been spent recapitalising weak financial institutions and removing non-performing loans from the financial sector, mostly through the use of government-supported asset management companies (Table 2). However, the proportion of these problem loans actually resolved remains small. The collapse of Daewoo in Korea in mid 1999 and the associated problems in the investment trust industry, as well as the suspension of three merchant banks this year, highlight the weakness that remains in Korea's financial sector and the potential risks to the region moving forward. ", " Less progress has been made on corporate restructuring in the region. Most emphasis here has been on voluntary restructuring which has come up against considerable resistance. A recent report by the World Bank suggests that in Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, at least one-quarter of firms listed on the stock exchange were not able to meet their interest payments from operational cash flows in 1999; this proportion was close to two-thirds in Indonesia. ", " Real GDP in New Zealand rose by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter to be 5½ per cent higher than a year earlier. Domestic demand growth was noticeably weaker in the quarter, following very strong growth through 1999, while the contribution to growth from net exports picked up. Although output growth remains strong, the labour market has been subdued; employment fell slightly in the June quarter, to be 1 per cent higher than a year earlier. Looking ahead, domestic demand growth may be tempered by the weakening in both business and consumer confidence that has taken place in recent months, though offsetting this, the lower level of the NZ$ should continue to support strong growth in the external sector. ", " Inflationary pressures have increased over the past year. The consumer price index increased by 0.7 per cent in the June quarter, to be 2.0 per cent higher than a year earlier, in part reflecting the increase in oil prices. Upstream price pressures have also been boosted by the rise in oil prices, as well as the depreciation of the exchange rate and the increase in world commodity prices; producer input and output prices have increased more sharply over the past six months than they have since the early 1990s. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has increased the Official Cash Rate by 200 basis points since November, to 6.5 per cent. ", " The economic outlook remains favourable in the euro area with output increasing firmly in the March quarter, to be 3.4 per cent higher over the year (Graph 6). The depreciation of the euro and strong world growth has provided a fillip to domestic producers with exports increasing strongly over the past year. The pick-up in growth has helped boost employment, with the unemployment rate falling to 9.1 per cent in June, the lowest rate since mid 1992. Steady employment and wages growth have helped underpin household incomes and provided support for continued growth in consumption. Positive conditions in the euro area are also reflected in both consumer and business confidence, which are now at or around record highs. ", " Although core inflation – at 1.3 per cent – remains subdued, headline inflation picked up sharply in June to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.4 per cent</span>. Currently, ten of the eleven EMU countries have headline inflation above the euro area target rate of 2 per cent. The European Central Bank (ECB) raised its key refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 4.25 per cent in early June. The ECB has raised interest rates five times, and by 175 basis points, since last November, expressing concern that the recent increase in imported goods prices, driven by both the depreciation of the euro and the pick-up in oil prices, poses risks for price stability over the medium term. ", " The UK economy strengthened in the June quarter, with real GDP increasing by 0.9 per cent, compared with growth of 0.5 per cent in the preceding quarter. This pick-up reflected stronger growth in both industrial production and service sector output. Nevertheless, survey evidence suggests that growth may begin to moderate moving forward, in line with a slowing in domestic demand. Consumer price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) was 2.2 per cent over the year to June, boosted by around three quarters of a percentage point by higher oil prices. ", " International financial markets have been in something of a holding pattern in recent months as they assessed the implications of increases in official interest rates in virtually all developed countries over the previous 6–12 months. Rises in official interest rates have been in the order of 1–2 percentage points across countries, with most in the top half of this range. ", " The United States Federal Reserve has raised the Fed funds target by 175 basis points, to 6.50 per cent, in the current monetary tightening episode which began in June last year (Graph 7). The first five increases were each of 25 basis points, but the latest increase, in May, was 50 basis points. This followed the release of data suggesting that wage and inflationary pressures may be building. ", " Among other English-speaking countries, the Bank of England has increased official rates by 100 basis points in four steps to 6 per cent, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has increased rates by 200 basis points to 6.5 per cent, and the Bank of Canada has increased rates by 125 basis points to 5.75 per cent, with the past four increases immediately following the US Fed (Table 3). ", " While economic expansions in the continental European economies are at a less advanced stage than those in the English-speaking economies, monetary authorities there also have generally increased interest rates, though the levels remain below those in the latter countries. The European Central Bank has increased official rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">175 basis points</span> to 4.25 per cent, while Denmark's central bank has increased rates by 185 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.7 per cent</span>. The Swedish central bank has increased policy rates by 85 basis points to 3.75 per cent, while the Swiss authorities have increased their target band by 175 basis points to between 3 and 4 per cent. ", " Japan remains an exception to the tightening cycle. With economic conditions in Japan improving in recent months, the Bank of Japan had begun to prime markets for an end to its zero interest rate policy at its 17 July meeting but, in the event, the collapse of a large Japanese retailer, Sogo Co, prompted the Bank to hold off its decision. Markets see this as no more than a temporary delay. ", " Since the last round of official interest rate increases around the world over May and June, market interest rates in many countries have fallen as earlier inflationary fears have subsided. In the US, yields on 10-year bonds have settled around 6 per cent compared with a peak of around 6.5 per cent. The yield on the German 10-year bond has fallen from around 5.45 per cent to 5.20 per cent. UK yields have fallen by a similar amount. The main exception to this global pattern has been Japan, where 10-year bond yields have remained remarkably stable, generally trading in the range between 1.7 per cent and 1.8 per cent so far this year (Graph 8). ", " As policy rates were increased in the US over the first few months of 2000, share markets became increasingly prone to volatility, culminating in a large correction over April and May (Graph 9). Markets with relatively high weightings in the technology sector were the hardest hit. The Nasdaq index fell by 25 per cent over this period. ", " Share prices recovered for a time in June as markets began to anticipate a ‘soft landing’ of the US economy, but more recently share prices have again been subject to weakness as profit announcements by companies have generally disappointed. Broad-based share indices in the US have now shown little net change so far this year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 4)</span>. ", " Share markets in most other countries have followed a similar course, with those with relatively higher weightings of technology stocks – such as Germany and Canada – having been more volatile (Graph 10). ", " Japanese share prices remain well below their early 2000 peaks. Following sharp falls in April and May which were part of the world-wide correction at that time, the Japanese market has remained under pressure amid some increase in corporate bankruptcies and rising prospects of some increase in interest rates. ", " The factors driving interest rates and share markets in recent months have also had an impact on exchange rates among the three major currencies. The trade-weighted value of the US dollar appreciated sharply over April and into May as inflationary concerns rose and markets anticipated a more aggressive monetary tightening by the Fed. It depreciated for a time as these concerns receded, but, more recently, has tended to rise again (Graph 11). This cycle was most pronounced against the euro (which fell to a record low against the US dollar in May) but was also evident to a degree in the rate against the yen (Graph 12). ", " Most of the Asian economies with freely floating currencies have experienced some exchange rate falls against the US dollar in recent months. This was particularly the case for Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines and mainly seemed to reflect concerns by international investors about whether their recent pace of economic expansion could be sustained. The falls were fairly modest (in the order of 5 per cent) and well within the fluctuations that could be expected of floating exchange rates. The earlier strong upward pressure on the Korean won, which had been resisted by the Bank of Korea through intervention, also seems to have abated in recent months. ", " The Australian economy continued to grow strongly in the first half of the year (Graph 13). Over the year to the March quarter, real output growth again exceeded 4 per cent, and indicators point to further strong growth in the June quarter. In the past few quarters, the composition of growth has gradually shifted, with a slight slowdown in the pace of consumption growth offset by an increase in export growth, in line with the strengthening world economy. The lower exchange rate, favourable domestic financial conditions and the boost to household incomes from income tax cuts and increases in social benefit payments should continue to support growth in the period ahead. ", " The strength of growth in the March quarter as measured in the national accounts was at odds with some of the partial indicators which had suggested that a noticeable slowdown was in train. However, it was consistent with a number of underlying economic factors supportive of growth. Robust household income growth bolstered by strong employment growth, fast credit growth and a high level of household wealth have underpinned the strength in consumption. The ready availability of funding and the high level of profits have contributed to a favourable environment for business. These factors appear to have offset any dampening influence from the declines in business and consumer confidence that occurred in the March quarter. More recently, as discussed below, the decline in consumer confidence has been reversed. ", " The changes to the tax system have affected some parts of the economy prior to their implementation on 1 July. This has been most evident in the housing sector, which was operating at full capacity in the March and June quarters. The tax changes also influenced consumption decisions with the purchase of some goods whose prices were expected to increase on 1 July being brought forward before that date, and other purchases where prices were expected to fall – most notably motor vehicles – being delayed. Some investment spending is likely to have been delayed until the September quarter to take advantage of lower prices, though this has been offset to some extent by businesses needing to invest in systems in preparation for the introduction of the goods and services tax and the new business reporting requirements. ", " The coincidence of the effects arising from the changes to the tax system and the Olympic Games in September will make interpreting developments in the economy, especially the monthly data, more difficult than usual over the near term. In aggregate, the introduction of the GST is likely to have resulted in a transfer of private demand from the September quarter to the June quarter, but the Olympics should provide an offsetting boost to consumption (from ticket sales) and service exports in the September quarter. ", " The national accounts showed continued growth in consumption spending, though at a slower pace, in the March quarter, after strong growth in the previous six months (Graph 14). This was in marked contrast to the retail trade figures which showed a sharp decline in spending in the March quarter. It is difficult to understand why the retail trade figures showed this result, but part of the answer may be in the pattern of consumption spending. There was reduced spending on retail goods, particularly sales of food, clothing and footwear, and motor vehicles, which was more than offset by increased spending on a variety of services, particularly transport, recreation and culture, hotels and cafes and utilities. ", " According to the monthly retail trade survey, retail sales remained relatively subdued (especially for the smaller, more specialised establishments) in April and May but rose very strongly in June. For the June quarter as a whole, sales increased in real terms by 2.7 per cent. This increase was experienced across all states, with particularly strong growth in the ACT, New South Wales and Western Australia (Table 5). While developments in income and wealth have been supportive of consumption spending, two additional factors are likely to have contributed to the rise. Firstly, a number of major retailers brought forward their half-yearly clearance sales from July into June. Secondly, consumers became more aware of the likely price changes resulting from the changes to the tax system through price listings such as those released by the ACCC in late May. The retail sales data for June suggest that consumers were, by then, generally well informed of the price changes, with large increases recorded in sales of goods that were expected to rise in price, such as clothing and footwear. Given the change in timing of the half-yearly sales and the pre-GST surge in spending, retail sales are likely to have been temporarily weaker in July. ", " In contrast to the surge in retail sales in June, households tended to delay their purchases of motor vehicles until after 30 June when the price of cars was expected to fall and a number of new models were launched on the Australian market. Passenger motor vehicle registrations fell by 13 per cent in the June quarter and were <span class=\"no-wrap\">17 per cent</span> lower than a year earlier. Motor vehicle retailers and wholesalers acted to offset some of the expected downturn by offering discounted prices prior to 1 July. The motor industry's expectation of stronger sales in the second half of the year is evident in the rapid growth of motor vehicle imports in the June quarter. This is consistent with indications of a strong rebound in sales in July. ", " The Westpac–Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment fell sharply in the early months of the year reaching a trough in May below its long-run average. The tightening in monetary policy is likely to have contributed to this decline, but the available evidence indicates that uncertainties about the tax package also had some effect. The Melbourne Institute's ‘Monitoring the GST’ surveys suggested that around 70 per cent of respondents either expected no compensation or didn't know whether they would receive any compensation. The rebound in consumer sentiment may have reflected the fact that the early experience with the GST was less traumatic than most had expected. ", " Growth in household incomes has supported consumption and should continue to do so in the period ahead, as employment and wages continue to grow solidly. Incomes have been boosted by the income tax cuts and increases in social benefit payments delivered on 1 July. The demutualisation of NRMA may also provide a small boost to household spending, although the payment of the final instalment of the second Telstra float in November may have a negative short-term effect on household cash flows. ", " In recent quarters, the increase in household wealth has also contributed to the robust pace of consumption spending. Although gross household wealth fell slightly in the March quarter, it remained 12 per cent higher than a year earlier, and 40 per cent higher than three years earlier (Table 6). The decline in wealth in the quarter primarily reflected falls in dwelling prices in Sydney and Melbourne. Dwelling prices nonetheless remain at high levels. They have increased over the past year in all mainland state capitals and in the non-metropolitan regions of all mainland states except Queensland. ", " Household sector financial assets increased by 1.7 per cent in the March quarter, a somewhat slower rate than in previous quarters, as a reduction in the value of direct equity holdings partially offset strong gains in the value of funds held in superannuation. Valuation effects, largely due to falls in the prices of bank shares, reduced the value of the household sector's directly owned share portfolio by 1.4 per cent in the March quarter, but these shares have since rebounded in value. ", " On the other side of the household balance sheet, the debt of the household sector has continued to grow rapidly, increasing by 14½ per cent over the year to March. This has primarily been driven by borrowing for housing, but growth in personal credit has also been strong. The rise in interest rates over the past seven months has not yet had a discernible impact on the borrowing of the household sector, with strong credit growth continuing in the June quarter. ", " The tightening in monetary policy has, however, resulted in a rise in the interest payments of the household sector from around 6 per cent of household disposable income in the first half of 1999, to around 7¼ per cent in the March quarter (Graph 15). The interest repayment burden on the household sector is now higher than the previous peak in 1996, of 7 per cent of disposable income, reflecting the rapid rise in household indebtedness. This is despite the fact that interest rates paid on debt by households are substantially lower now than in 1996. The interest repayment burden is likely to have increased further in the June quarter as household credit continued to increase at a faster pace than disposable income, and mortgage rates rose. The extent to which this is impinging on household cash flows is less clear. The practice of holding total repayments (i.e. interest plus principal) steady while interest rates fell in 1996 and 1997 appears to have been widespread. This built up a buffer of ‘excess’ repayments which will have cushioned some households from the direct effects of the recent interest rate increases. ", " While the growth in households' spending on retail goods eased early in the year, spending on dwellings increased significantly. Private dwelling investment grew by 10 per cent in the March quarter and by almost 14 per cent over the previous year, and now accounts for over 6 per cent of GDP, the highest in over twenty years (Graph 16). Although a large part of this activity probably reflects the desire to complete construction prior to the introduction of the GST, other factors have contributed to the strong demand for housing, notably the relatively high levels of affordability throughout 1999. More recently, increases in house prices and interest rates have reduced home affordability. ", " Leading indicators of dwelling activity began to decline as the opportunity to complete work prior to the introduction of the GST diminished. Although the value of loan approvals increased in May, the average level of loan approvals for the three months to May was 11 per cent below the level in late 1999. For owner-occupiers, the largest declines have been in approvals for new construction. In contrast, loans to investors for both new construction and existing houses (a sector likely to have been less affected by the introduction of the GST) have continued to grow at double-digit rates in year-ended terms. Building approvals have fallen sharply in recent months to be nearly 40 per cent below the January peak, although this follows a strong rise of 17 per cent over the previous six months. The largest falls in building approvals in recent months have been in Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. It remains to be seen how much of the large fall in building approvals in June will be reversed following the actual implementation of the GST and the availability of the First Home Owners' Scheme (discussed below). ", " Notwithstanding the unwinding of the effect of the GST on the housing industry, shortages of labour and materials and the large amount of work yet to be done at the end of the March quarter means that a lot of pre-GST related work will probably spill over into the second half of 2000 (Graph 17). In addition, dwelling activity in the second half of the year is likely to be boosted by policies to assist first home buyers. The most recent loan approvals data showed a declining share of housing commitments going to first home buyers in the lead-up to the GST. Given the extra time taken to complete work prior to the introduction of the GST, there was an incentive for first home buyers to wait and be eligible for the Commonwealth Government's grant to first home buyers of $7,000. In New South Wales, further savings for first home buyers of up to $5,000 in stamp duty exemptions were available from 1 July. ", " Despite the sharp fall in housing loan approvals, growth in the stock of housing credit has continued to accelerate. Housing credit grew at an annual rate of just under 19 per cent over the first half of 2000, compared with <span class=\"no-wrap\">16¼ per cent</span> over the previous six months. The divergence between housing credit growth and loan approvals may partly reflect lags between the purchase of a home and final settlement. Repayments of principal could also slow in the months immediately following an increase in interest rates, if borrowers who were making more than the contractually required repayment chose to maintain their total repayment as interest rates rose, thereby allowing the amount of principal repaid to fall. ", " In addition, the capacity constraints in the building sector in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST may have resulted in borrowers obtaining finance for construction well before the work was completed and paid for. Accordingly, a substantial pool of undrawn commitments built up over the last few months of 1999 and the beginning of this year, peaking at a level equivalent to just under 8 per cent of housing credit. In recent months, the flow of loans actually advanced has risen sharply, which may reflect borrowers drawing down their loans in order to finalise payments for their dwellings. The stock of loan commitments not advanced still remains at very high levels, suggesting that housing credit growth is likely to remain high over the next quarter as construction work begun before 1 July is completed and paid for. ", " A favourable external environment, continued strong growth in domestic demand, high profitability and the ready availability of external funds have underpinned a positive environment for the business sector. In the March quarter, strong growth in output was particularly evident in the construction, mining and agricultural sectors. Pre-GST activity boosted output in the construction industry and, given the large amount of work yet to be done in the residential sector, this should support activity in the industry in the period ahead. The addition of new supply capacity in the oil industry, reflecting earlier investment, boosted growth in the mining sector in the March quarter. The strength was not confined to oil, with other areas of the mining sector such as base metals also experiencing strong growth in output through the year. ", " Profits continued to grow strongly in the March quarter, with the gross operating surplus of the corporate sector increasing by just under 9 per cent, and by 11¾ per cent over the year to the March quarter. As a share of GDP, corporate profits reached 16 per cent in the quarter (Graph 18), the highest recorded ratio, although this has been boosted in recent years by privatisations and the trend towards incorporation by small businesses. Strong profitability, low interest rates and a debt burden well below historical peaks have all tended to hold down the interest burden of the corporate sector: as a share of gross operating surplus, net interest paid by the corporate sector remains well below historical averages. ", " In addition to the internal funds generated by strong profit results, businesses have ample access to external sources of funding. Business credit has accelerated in recent months, growing at an annual rate just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> over the first half of 2000, compared with 4¾ per cent over the previous six months. Both fixed and revolving credit increased, with promissory notes particularly strong for much of this period. The strength in intermediated business borrowing has been reinforced by a high level of non-intermediated debt raisings. Although some share market floats were cancelled or postponed following the decline in share prices earlier in the year, the subsequent rebound in prices should limit any weakness in equity raisings. ", " Despite these favourable conditions, businesses reported a deterioration in sentiment early in the year which continued into the June quarter, according to the NAB Quarterly Business Survey (Graph 19). This reflected a combination of concerns about the implementation of the tax changes, the impact of higher oil prices on profit margins, as well as higher interest rates. While the deterioration was reported by firms of all sizes, small firms reported the weakest conditions. The mining industry was a notable exception to the fall in business conditions, reflecting the favourable combination of rising commodity prices and strong external demand. ", " While data for retail sales reported a decline in the March quarter, there was also a large run-down in business inventories at this time as measured by the ABS, particularly in the retail sector. This juxtaposition of events is surprising, given the strong growth in imports in the quarter and the business surveys which indicated that inventories increased in the March quarter. ", " The decline in business sentiment did not hinder strong growth in business investment in the March quarter. This rise in investment largely reflected a solid rise in spending on machinery and equipment (Graph 20). While the quarterly investment outcomes recorded in the national accounts have been volatile, throughout 1999/2000, successive surveys of capital expenditure by the ABS indicated higher expected investment spending for the year as a whole. Strength in recent quarters has been evident in the communications, finance and property, and business services sectors. Investment in the manufacturing, retail, wholesale, and transport and storage sectors has been either steady or falling. ", " It is difficult to discern a clear picture of investment intentions in 2000/01, because it is unclear the extent to which businesses have taken account of the lower prices for many investment goods resulting from the replacement of wholesale taxes with the GST on 1 July. (Firms were asked by the ABS to report their investment intentions net of the GST.) According to the ABS Capital Expenditure Survey, firms expect to increase spending on machinery and equipment investment in nominal terms by only 1½ per cent in 2000/01, once average realisation ratios are applied. Assuming that businesses did indeed take account of the lower prices on investment goods after 1 July, this implies that there is likely to be stronger real growth in investment in plant and equipment in 2000/01. As a share of GDP, investment is around average levels, suggesting there is scope for it to grow as the economy continues to expand. ", " The non-residential building component of buildings and structures investment also rose strongly in the March quarter, although this was not enough to offset a large fall in engineering construction. Expenditure on engineering construction has been particularly weak since the beginning of 1999 and is nearly one-quarter lower than the level a year earlier. The immediate outlook for non-residential building work has improved slightly, with building approvals picking up from the trough reached late last year. Increased pressure on office rentals, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, points to some scope for future growth in new office projects. According to the Access Property Monitor, growth in building work is projected to occur in the retail and wholesale sectors. By contrast, the value of building projects in the hospitality sector (hotels and resorts) is expected to fall. ", " The estimates of intangible investment (which comprises computer software, minerals exploration and artistic originals) and livestock investment continued to grow strongly in the March quarter, to be just over 20 per cent higher than a year earlier. Some of the strength in the first half of 2000 probably relates to businesses purchasing software to assist with the new tax arrangements and the associated change in business reporting requirements. Some purchases may also have been brought forward as software prices were expected to increase from 1 July. Mineral exploration expenditure has continued to decline. Expenditure in the March quarter was around half the peak level of expenditure recorded in 1997, with a reduction in gold exploration accounting for most of the fall. ", " Following a pick-up in the second half of 1999, employment growth remained at an above-average rate in the first half of 2000. Employment increased by 285,000, or 3¼ per cent, over the year to the June quarter, substantially faster than the rate of growth prevailing for most of the previous four years; almost three-quarters of the increase was in full-time employment. The recent strength in employment growth contributed to a further decline in the unemployment rate to 6¾ per cent in the June quarter, compared with almost 7½ per cent a year ago <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 21)</span>. The participation rate continued to rise in the first half of the year, reflecting the strengthening labour market and buoyant economic activity generally, reaching 63¾ per cent in the June quarter. The female participation rate has risen more sharply than the male equivalent over the past year. ", " Strong employment growth over the past year has occurred in most states and has contributed to falls in unemployment rates in every state (Table 7). The recent strength in national employment growth has been underpinned by increases in employment growth in NSW and Victoria, partly driven by the rapid growth in residential housing investment in those states. Employment growth over the year to the June quarter was <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span> in both state capitals and non-metropolitan areas. In the June quarter, the unemployment rate in the capital cities was 6.1 per cent, almost a percentage point lower than a year earlier. The unemployment rate in non-metropolitan areas has fallen more modestly, to 8.1 per cent, associated with a larger rise in labour force participation in non-metropolitan areas. ", " The pick-up in employment growth and relatively stable output growth over the past year has resulted in a fall in measured labour productivity growth. In terms of output per hour worked, year-ended productivity growth has eased to about 1¾ per cent, down from the average of 3¼ per cent prevailing in the previous three years. Abstracting from short-term fluctuations, productivity growth remains relatively robust, with gains in the current expansion spread across most industries. ", " While a high level of job vacancies continues to indicate strong employment growth in the near term, information on employment intentions from the major business surveys has been weaker recently (Graph 22). The ABS job vacancies series, which surveys employers, recorded a new high in May, with the recent rise concentrated in the public sector and in Victoria. The newspaper-based job advertisements series published by both the ANZ Bank and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business have softened recently, with both series falling over the past three months, though they remain at high levels. Employment intentions reported in the NAB business survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers have fallen below their peaks recorded in mid 1999, with the NAB business survey recording its lowest level of employment intentions in two years. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Forward-looking</span> indicators of labour demand in the construction sector suggest a significant decline from current levels, in line with the expected decline in construction activity noted above. The major business surveys suggest that the difficulty firms face in finding suitable labour has eased slightly in the past six months but remains at relatively high levels. ", " Export revenues have continued to grow rapidly due to stronger world demand, the depreciation of the Australian dollar and firmer commodity prices (Graph 23). These gains in the value of exports have been to most major destinations, with the growth of exports to East Asia being particularly pronounced (Graph 24). The strong increase in export receipts, however, has been matched by solid growth in the value of imports. This reflects the continuing strength in domestic demand and, in the most recent period, stronger import prices. As a result, the trade deficit has remained at around 2 per cent of GDP for the last three quarters, although it has declined from the peak reached in the middle of 1999. ", " Most major categories of export earnings have increased strongly over the past year (Graph 25). The value of resource exports (excluding re-exported gold) increased by over 40 per cent over the past year, with this strength reflecting a combination of stronger volumes and prices. Exports of oil, gas and petroleum products accounted for a substantial portion of the rise, due to sharp increases in the price of crude oil and significant expansions in production capacity. Other major resource exports, like metal ores and processed metals, also benefited from capacity expansions, higher prices and the continued improvement in trading partner growth, particularly in East Asia. Steaming coal exports, after a period of weakness through late 1998 and 1999, have recovered in the first half of 2000, particularly to South Korea and Taiwan. ", " The growth in rural exports in the first half of the year resulted from strength in the export of wool products and other rural goods (particularly canola). These volume gains were driven by record levels of farm production, and were supported by stronger prices, particularly for meat and wool products. ", " According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), the total area planted to winter crops is forecast to be a record 19.2 million hectares in 2000/01, following good planting rains across most grain-growing areas in the eastern states. Total meat production is forecast to fall slightly in 2000/01 as cattle herd rebuilding continues, though live cattle exports are expected to increase, reflecting a further improvement in Asian demand. Wool production is expected to fall slightly. Overall, ABARE expects the volume of farm production in 2000/01 to at least match the record levels achieved in 1999/00, and this will support rural export volumes over the year ahead. ", " Manufactured export earnings again increased strongly in the June quarter, and were 19 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. As has been the case since the middle of 1999, much of the growth has been recorded in exports of transport equipment. Growth in manufactured exports to the European Union, the United States, the Middle East, and recoveries in demand from non-Japan Asia, have underpinned this strength. ", " Service exports increased moderately in the first half of 2000. After a slight fall in the March quarter, tourism revenues rebounded strongly in the June quarter as arrivals from Japan, the United Kingdom and New Zealand all increased solidly. Export earnings related to sponsorships, royalties and tourism are expected to rise substantially in the September quarter due to the staging of the Olympics in Sydney. Travel exports may also be boosted in coming periods if the exchange rate remains around current levels. ", " The value of imports of goods and services rose again in the June quarter, to be around 20 per cent higher than a year earlier. However, the strength in the June quarter, in contrast to previous quarters, is largely due to higher import prices, rather than continued growth in import volumes. Indeed, in volume terms, headline imports of goods and services appear to have remained flat in the June quarter, following very strong growth in the March quarter. Over the past year, the volume of imports in both headline and underlying terms has risen by a little over 10 per cent, reflecting the continuing strength in domestic demand. ", " Capital imports were weaker in the June quarter, although this softening in demand followed exceptional strength in the March quarter. Imports of major capital equipment, such as machinery, computers and telecommunications equipment, remain at very high levels. Consumption import volumes remained firm, with growth in excess of <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> over the past twelve months. Imports of motor vehicles increased noticeably in the June quarter as retailers and wholesalers stockpiled cars in anticipation of stronger demand in the second half of the year. While the growth of underlying intermediate imports has moderated from the exceptionally strong growth observed in the latter half of 1999, it continues to grow in line with the pace of growth of the domestic economy. Service import volumes have increased by 9 per cent over the past year. ", " Net foreign liabilities rose by 1 per cent in the March quarter to $383 billion, or 61 per cent of GDP. Net foreign debt rose to 41 per cent of GDP, on account of both increased foreign borrowings and valuation effects flowing from the depreciation in the A$ in the quarter. These valuation effects, however, also resulted in a decline in net foreign equity liabilities in the quarter. The net income deficit widened to $4.7 billion in the March quarter, with increased income inflows due to higher returns on equity investments abroad partially offsetting growth in outflows. The ratio of net income payments to exports remains around 16 per cent. ", " Commodity prices generally moved higher again during the June quarter, reflecting stronger world demand and a recovery in rural prices. Base metal prices, which rose strongly in the second half of 1999, have fallen a little over the first half of this year. ", " The price of oil rose by around US$5 per barrel over the June quarter, with the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil trading above US$30 per barrel for much of June (Graph 26). The rise reflected a growing realisation that the first increase in OPEC production quotas, which were negotiated in March, might not match increases in world demand. In late June, OPEC members decided to increase their crude oil output quotas further from 1 July. However, in contrast to the reaction following the March output increase, the oil price did not fall sharply following this announcement, as the market judged the increase was again likely to be insufficient to exceed projected increases in global demand. Subsequent statements have seen some OPEC member countries canvassing the possibility of further quota increases, placing downward pressure on prices since early July. However, such suggestions have elicited a mixed response from other member countries, and, to date, no official increase in OPEC production targets has been agreed. ", " In SDR terms, the Bank's index of commodity prices increased again in the June quarter, to be about 7 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 27). Continued strong gains in rural commodity prices underpinned the strength in the June quarter, while the base metals index fell for the first time since early 1999. ", " The price of every component of the rural index rose in the quarter, in both domestic and foreign currency terms, with sugar, cotton, and wool prices exhibiting particular strength. The sugar price increased by more than one-third on expectations of lower output from Brazil, the world's largest producer, and buying interest from Asia (particularly the Philippines). Cotton prices also experienced a second consecutive quarter of very strong gains, on forecasts that world demand would substantially exceed supply next year. In foreign currency terms, wool prices gained over 7 per cent in the quarter, due to rising demand for the finer wools. Wheat prices increased by almost 5 per cent in the quarter, staging strong gains early in the period on fears that dry weather in several large producer countries (in particular the US) would result in lower world supply. An unexpectedly large purchase from a major importer (Egypt) also pushed prices higher. ", " The non-rural index of commodity prices (excluding base metals) remained unchanged in the quarter. Although the 4–5 per cent falls in negotiated contract prices for steaming and coking coal came into effect on 1 April, there was a recovery in the spot market for these commodities in the quarter. Iron ore contract prices rose by between 4 and 6 per cent in the quarter. Despite some gains towards the end of the June quarter, the price of gold fell marginally due to lacklustre demand. ", " Base metal prices fell by close to 5 per cent in the June quarter, but remain around 20 per cent higher over the year. Aluminium, lead and copper prices all fell, dragged down by concerns that the US economy is slowing. Nickel prices increased slightly in the quarter, but were volatile; after reaching a peak in mid May, the resolution of labour disputes at major Canadian producers saw prices fall sharply through late May and June before stabilising in early July. ", " The behaviour of the Australian dollar so far in 2000 can be divided into a number of phases. The first few months of the year, through to the second half of April, were a period of unilateral Australian dollar weakness (Graph 28). The trade-weighted index fell by a similar amount to the rate against the US dollar. ", " From late April and into May, the currency continued to fall against the US dollar, but this was mainly a reflection of US dollar strength. The Australian dollar was steadier in trade-weighted terms and, indeed, it rose against some currencies, including the euro, during this period. ", " The initial recovery in the Australian dollar in early June continued to be mainly a mirror image of US dollar movements (i.e. the reversal of the US dollar strength). As such it was less pronounced in trade-weighted terms. Following the release of National Accounts data, however, which were a good deal stronger than expected and prompted many analysts to conclude that their earlier assessments of a slowing in the economy had been overstated, the exchange rate moved higher against all currencies. ", " More recently, the currency has fallen somewhat again. For a time, this was associated with the weakness in some Asian currencies, both because markets see Australia's prospects as being closely tied to those of Asia and because some investors sold into the Australian market as a proxy for the less liquid Asian currency markets. Subsequently, it became mainly a reflection of re-emerging US dollar strength. As such, the fall in the Australian dollar's rate against the latter currency again became more pronounced than the fall in the trade-weighted index. ", " The market responded to the August monetary announcement with a small rise in the exchange rate. Nonetheless, it remains at a relatively low level. At around US58 cents, it is 10 per cent below its average level for 1999. The trade-weighted index is about 7 per cent below its 1999 average. ", " The Bank has not undertaken any operations in the foreign exchange market in recent months to influence the currency. ", " After the four increases in official interest rates between November 1999 and May 2000, short-term market interest rates fell for a time as markets became more comfortable with the outlook for inflation. This was similar to the experience in many other countries. More recently, however, Australian short-term yields moved up again in response to the run of economic news, particularly that on inflation (Graph 29). A significant probability of an August tightening had been priced into market yields in the days before its announcement, and it was followed by only a modest further rise in yields. As of early August, the yield on 90-day bank bills was 6.4 per cent. ", " As has been a feature of recent years, yields on long-term government bonds in Australia have continued to move broadly in line with those in the United States (Graph 30). Bond yields here and in the US peaked in early 2000 and have since fallen. In Australia, the peak in the 10-year yield was 7.25 per cent, and the current level is <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.1 per cent</span>. This fall has been larger than the fall in the United States so that the spread between 10-year yields in the two countries has narrowed from about 60 basis points to about 20 basis points. ", " For a period in early May, bond yields in Australia had moved below those in the United States, i.e. the differential had become negative. The only other time this had happened was in mid 1998, when there were concerns about the outlook for the Australian economy due to the expected impact of the Asian crisis. In the more recent episode, it largely reflected expectations that the tightening cycle in the United States would be noticeably more pronounced than in Australia. ", " As in a number of other countries, bond issuance in Australia in recent years has shifted away from the public sector toward the private sector. With $74 billion of non-government bonds outstanding, this sector is now larger than the market for Commonwealth Government securities (Graph 31). ", " This points to the need to look at movements in interest rates beyond those on government securities. The recent fall in corporate yields has been a little less than that in government yields. For ‘A’ rated corporates, the spread over government bonds of comparable maturity is currently about 100 basis points, which is noticeably wider than a couple of years ago (Graph 32). ", " The repricing of credit risk has been evident in several countries, although these shifts are more prominent in the United States and United Kingdom than in other countries, as can be seen in the spread between yields on government bonds and yields in swap markets (Graph 33). The 10-year swap spread in the United States, for example, has increased in 2000 by about 50 basis points, to a level higher than at the time of disruptions in markets during the LTCM crisis in 1998. ", " Some commentators have attributed the widening in spreads to the reduced supply of government paper, but this does not appear to be the entire story. The reduction in public sector debt has been larger in Australia than in the United States (and elsewhere) and the short-term outlook is for this to continue. Yet spreads in Australia have not increased as much. The diminution of supply of government bonds therefore seems, at best, to be a partial explanation of rising credit spreads (Table 8). ", " Other factors may have been a degree of illiquidity in the swap market in the face of large increases in private sector bond issuance and rising interest rates. Rising interest rates are likely to result in investors projecting ahead to slower economic growth and the possibility of higher default rates. These concerns might recently have been exacerbated by changes in the pattern of corporate financing: in countries in which the swap spread has increased the most – the US and UK – growth in private sector bond issuance has been relatively large, while net equity issuance has been low (or even negative as in the United States). This switch from raising funds in equity markets to bond markets would, other things equal, also tend to raise concerns about credit quality, as corporate leverage would tend to rise. By contrast, while private-sector bond issuance has been high in Australia and, to a lesser extent, Canada, new equity has been equally high. ", " Banks raised interest rates on most categories of variable-rate loans by a similar amount to the rises in the cash rate between November 1999 and May 2000 (Table 9). Some business overdraft rates had risen by slightly more than this. Those banks which so far have announced changes to interest rates following the tightening in early August have also matched the rise in the cash rate. In addition, some banks have announced increases in interest rates on selected lending products of between 1 and 15 basis points to recover the added cost of inputs which attract the GST. (Financial services are ‘input-taxed’, meaning that financial service providers cannot claim a tax credit for these costs.) ", " The level of intermediaries' interest rates for households and small businesses remains historically low – in particular, notwithstanding the fact that the cash rate exceeds by 1.5 percentage points its level at the previous cyclical trough in 1993/94, rates paid by borrowers, especially for housing, typically remain below their level at that time. ", " Mortgage managers have, on average, raised their housing interest rates by more than banks because they fund their lending in wholesale markets, whereas banks also draw on a low-cost supply of retail deposits: since money market interest rates over the past year have tended to trade significantly above the cash rate, mortgage managers' margins have been squeezed. ", " The pattern of increases in credit card rates has varied from bank to bank. While the average increase by the major banks since end October is a little smaller than the rise in the cash rate, banks did not lower credit card rates by as much as the cut in the cash rate during the previous easing phase. On the whole, margins on credit card lending have tended to widen since the mid 1990s. ", " The flagship small business rate – on residentially secured term loans – has been increased in line with the cash rate. Rises in other indicator rates on loans to small businesses have, on average, tended to be larger than this as some banks have raised some rates independent of monetary policy moves (including by some banks to recoup the costs of the GST). Measured across all loan products, and taking into account changes in customer risk margins, however, it seems that interest rates paid on average by small businesses have increased by a little less than the rise in interest rates directly due to the tightening of monetary policy. This is because small businesses lending has been migrating to low-interest rate loan products, such as residentially secured loans. ", " Interest rates on new fixed-rate loans have fallen over recent months, reflecting falls in yields in capital markets in which these loans are funded (Graph 34). Banks' 3-year fixed housing lending rates have fallen by an average of 35 basis points, from their peak earlier in the year, to 7.60 per cent. The corresponding indicator rate for small businesses has fallen by 55 basis points from its peak, to 8.20 per cent. Fixed-rate loans for housing have fallen by less than those for small businesses since they had also risen by less during the phase of rising yields in capital markets in 1999. ", " The increases in banks' retail deposit rates since last year have, in most cases, been smaller than the rise in the cash rate (and lending rates), especially for transaction accounts and accounts with small balances. (Some deposit rates were also reduced to cover rises in costs of banks' inputs associated with the introduction of the GST.) ", " Credit growth remains strong and has picked up noticeably in recent months, driven by an acceleration in both business and housing credit (Table 10). Credit outstanding increased at an annual rate of more than 15 per cent over the first half of this year, and by just over 13 per cent over the year to June. Growth in housing credit has been consistently strong for an extended period, and has picked up further in the first half of this year, with much of the strength concentrated in borrowing to purchase investment properties. Business credit growth, in contrast, was quite weak around the middle of 1999, but in recent months has recovered to reach an annualised rate of around 13 per cent over the first half of 2000. While growth in personal credit has slowed a little, it remains robust. Within personal credit, revolving finance such as credit cards and overdrafts have continued to be stronger than traditional fixed-term loans. ", " Margin lending by banks and brokers grew by 3.6 per cent in the June quarter, somewhat slower than the increase of around 10 per cent in each of the previous three quarters. The earlier large rises reflected the second tranche of the privatisation of Telstra and strong activity in the share market by retail investors. With the market being more subdued of late, demand for margin loans has increased less quickly. Margin lending now stands at $6.5 billion, and accounts for approximately 9 per cent of non-housing personal credit outstanding. ", " Growth in the deposit aggregates has picked up from a slower period in the latter half of 1999. Both M3 and broad money registered robust growth in the three months to June, and annualised growth over the first half of 2000 was over 10 per cent. This compares with annual growth rates of around 4 per cent over the six months to December 1999. The pick-up in current (cheque-linked) deposits has been particularly marked. In contrast, abstracting from the increased circulation of cash around the end of last year, annual growth in currency has been relatively stable at around 7–8 per cent for a number of years. ", " The financial aggregates are likely to become somewhat more volatile in coming months, due to a change to reporting arrangements that will remove some of the smoothing effect generated by averaging data within individual months. Analysis of trends in credit growth will therefore need to take account of a greater degree of noise in the series in the future. ", " Growth in funds under management slowed to 3 per cent in the March quarter, from 5.3 per cent in the December quarter, and was 15 per cent over the year to the March quarter. The increase in the value of assets during the latest quarter was mainly driven by strong growth in the value of equities and units in trusts, and overseas assets (Table 11). With domestic share prices relatively flat over the March quarter, the increase in equities and units in trusts suggests net inflows to this asset class. Similarly, the growth in overseas assets in the quarter probably reflected valuation effects flowing from the depreciation of the exchange rate in the quarter or net inflows to this asset class; the mixed performance of overseas equity markets during this period implies that valuation effects flowing from increases in equity prices would have been small. Institutions with high exposure to overseas assets, particularly superannuation funds and public unit trusts, recorded the largest asset gains in the quarter. ", " Share prices in Australia softened early in the June quarter, in line with US developments. Since then, however, the Australian market has done better than its US counterpart and prices attained a record high in July. The ASX 200 index is about 12 per cent above its low point in the June quarter, and its level a year ago. ", " The industrial and resource sectors have both shown relatively small increases over the past year; stocks of financial companies are up by 15 per cent (Graph 35). ", " Measures of consumer price inflation continue to increase. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.8 per cent</span> in the June quarter 2000 and by 3.2 per cent over the year (Graph 36). Measures of underlying inflation, which are less sensitive to movements in the volatile components of the CPI, indicate that inflation has gradually increased to around 2½ per cent from its recent trough of around 1½ per cent (Graph 37). While some of the rise in inflation over the past year or so reflects increases in the price of oil and tax-related increases in the cost of insurance, house purchase and cigarettes and tobacco, the pick-up in inflation has been quite broadly based (Table 12). ", " Retail petrol prices increased by 3.2 per cent in the June quarter, reflecting a combination of higher world prices of oil over the past six months as well as the influence of a lower exchange rate. Together, these two factors led to an increase in the Australian dollar price of crude oil of around 7 per cent in the June quarter. Over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>, retail petrol prices have risen by 22 per cent, contributing 0.9 percentage points to the increase in the CPI over that time. In recent weeks, the price of crude oil has fluctuated around a level close to the June quarter average. Assuming that the exchange rate remains around its current level, this would imply little further change in petrol prices at the pump in the September quarter (Graph 38). ", " The large rise in the house purchase component of the CPI over the past year has contributed to the increase in the CPI and to most measures of underlying inflation. The cost of house purchase increased by 0.4 per cent in the June quarter and by 7.5 per cent over the year to the June quarter. The increase over the past year has reflected the strength of housing activity and the emergence of capacity constraints in the industry, as discussed above in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’. The strength in the housing industry has been supported by underlying demand factors, notably the growth of incomes and the relatively low cost of housing credit, but it has also partly reflected the desire to complete work before the introduction of the GST. ", " A range of other prices are likely to have been affected by the changes to the tax system before the introduction of the GST on 1 July, though in ways that are difficult to measure precisely. The payment of GST on insurance premiums has boosted those components of CPI inflation over the past year; the method of measurement based on premiums net of claims means that the recorded price of insurance in the CPI has increased by more than the GST rate. Working in the other direction, the reduction in the top wholesale sales tax rate on some items last year, such as televisions and VCRs, had a small offsetting effect. Motor vehicle prices also appear to have been lower than otherwise, rising by only ½ per cent over the past six months despite the exchange rate depreciation, reflecting discounting ahead of the introduction of the GST in an attempt to smooth sales. ", " Private-sector services prices have increased at a consistently faster pace than private-sector goods prices for most of the past six years (Graph 39). While this pattern has continued over the past year, much of the discrepancy in recent quarters is accounted for by the contribution of GST-related increases in the cost of insurance to <span class=\"no-wrap\">private-sector</span> services prices. Excluding insurance, private-sector services prices rose by 0.5 per cent in the June quarter and by 2.5 per cent over the year. ", " Over the past year, the price of tradeables continued to grow more slowly than that of non-tradeables. The <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> increase in the price of tradeables in the June quarter reflected a large increase in petrol prices, but also higher prices for fresh vegetables and overseas travel and accommodation, with the latter increase, in part, due to seasonal factors. Abstracting from the effect of oil, tradeables prices increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter and by 0.2 per cent over the past year. However, the recent weakness of the exchange rate is likely to result in larger increases in the price of tradeables over the coming year (see below). The price of non-tradeables rose by a little over 4 per cent over the past year; this component comprises mainly services and includes the cost of house purchase. ", " In import-weighted terms, the Australian dollar has depreciated by around 5½ per cent since the beginning of the year. The lower exchange rate contributed to the sharp increase in the wholesale price of manufactured goods in the June quarter, for example, in meat products and petrol. Some pass-through of these wholesale price increases to retail prices is apparent in the June quarter. However, the recent rise in manufacturing wholesale prices, excluding petrol, is likely to be seen more fully in retail goods prices in coming quarters. ", " The overall effect of the currency depreciation on inflation is subject to considerable uncertainty. The depreciation of the Australian dollar during the Asian crisis had little discernible effect on final consumer prices over the subsequent couple of years. However, a number of factors suggest that the depreciation of the currency over the course of this year is more likely to be passed through to final consumer prices. Conditions in the economy are tighter now than in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, the deflationary impulse from Asian producers is no longer present and world commodity prices are rising. ", " Recent movements in the exchange rate have also been reflected in indexes of trade prices; the export price index rose by more than 16 per cent over the past year, with higher prices for base metals, chemicals, and petroleum aided by higher world prices and increased demand. Prices of imported consumption goods at the docks increased by almost 4 per cent in the June quarter, after a very modest rise in the March quarter, and have now regained their level of nearly two years ago. ", " A wide range of producer prices increased sharply in the June quarter (Table 13). Although some specific factors have contributed considerably to these increases, most notably the rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the exchange rate, the pick-up in producer price inflation has been broadly based. ", " Both domestic and imported manufacturing input prices increased strongly in the June quarter, largely reflecting the continued rise in the world price of oil and the 10 per cent depreciation of the exchange rate over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span>. Excluding oil, the domestic component increased by around 1 per cent in the June quarter, driven by rises in utilities and metal ore prices, while the non-oil-related prices of imported inputs rose by a similar amount. As a consequence, inflation in manufacturing output prices also picked up in the June quarter. Although prices of petroleum and basic metal products have contributed close to two-thirds of the overall increase in this series over the past year, in recent quarters there has been an intensification of upstream price pressures across most components (Graph 40). ", " Strong demand in the housing sector fuelled increases in building materials prices in the June quarter, with the increase most noticeable in Sydney. Property and business services prices rose strongly for the fifth successive quarter. Growth in other building materials prices also picked up in the June quarter, but the rise in this series over the past year has been more subdued than that in the house-building series, due to the slower pace of activity in the non-residential construction sector. ", " A new ABS publication, <em>Stage of Production Producer Price Indexes</em>, presents an arrangement of existing producer price indexes at three stages of production – preliminary, intermediate and final. These indexes confirm that there have been strong increases in prices at all stages of production. At the final stage, producer prices of consumption goods and services increased by 5 per cent over the year to the June quarter, with higher wholesale petrol and food prices being the main contributors. Final producer prices of capital goods have increased due to the higher price of project home prices and exchange-rate induced increases in the price of imports, such as industrial machinery and computer equipment. ", " Indicators of wage growth have shown divergent movements recently (Table 14). The Wage Cost Index (WCI) for total hours (excluding bonuses), an indicator of movements in average wage rates, increased by 2.8 per cent over the year to the March quarter 2000, which is close to the previous readings for this indicator (Graph 41). Enterprise bargaining outcomes in the early part of the year also suggested little change in the rate of wage growth; new federal enterprise agreements in the March quarter yielded an average annualised increase of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 per cent</span>, unchanged from the previous quarter. In a trend that has been evident for a couple of years, replacement agreements in the March quarter provided for slightly lower wage increases than the expiring agreements. ", " In contrast, the survey of average weekly earnings has recorded a pick-up in growth in average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) in recent quarters. Preliminary estimates suggest that AWOTE increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.5 per cent</span> over the year to May, up from the low point of 2.1 per cent reached in the September quarter last year. Being a measure of the wage bill rather than wage rates, this series is susceptible to shifts in the composition of employment. The effect of such compositional shifts, and the volatility of the series more generally over recent years, make the survey difficult to interpret. It is possible, against a background of increasing inflation and a strengthening labour market, that the survey is signalling some pick-up in underlying wage pressures, but at this stage the extent of any such pick-up is difficult to assess. ", " Recent business surveys have pointed to some upward pressure on wage growth although, again, the extent of such pressure is difficult to gauge. The NAB survey indicates that the growth of labour costs has picked up over the year to June, though the rate of growth in this series is still quite low. Looking forward, the survey also suggests that businesses expect a modest pick-up in growth of labour costs in the September quarter. Both the NAB and the ACCI-Westpac surveys point to higher expectations for wage increases under enterprise agreements. These results may have been influenced by prospects for the wage campaign in the Victorian manufacturing sector, which has recently commenced. Preliminary negotiations between unions and some Victorian manufacturers suggest that new agreements may provide for wage increases slightly higher than those yielded in current agreements. Manufacturing unions are likely to attempt to pursue an industry-wide agreement for other Australian manufacturers in July 2001. In the construction sector, negotiations between unions and employers are now more or less complete. The new agreements have provided for wage increases that are slightly less than those specified in the expiring agreements. ", " The effect of GST-related clauses in enterprise agreements represents a source of uncertainty in the wages outlook. A number of enterprise agreements incorporate clauses that seek either additional compensation for CPI movements in excess of a benchmark or the ability to review wage increases should the effect of the GST on the price level exceed expectations. At present, however, only a small proportion of enterprise agreements contain a clause of this nature, or clauses that directly link wage increases to movements in the CPI. ", " Survey-based measures of inflation expectations have shown divergent trends in recent months. The introduction of the new tax system has complicated the inflation outlook, while higher oil prices and the lower exchange rate have tended to push up inflation expectations. ", " Inflation expectations of consumers, as measured by the Melbourne Institute, fell sharply from above 7 per cent in the months preceding the introduction of the GST to 4.6 per cent in July, around the levels recorded <span class=\"no-wrap\">a year ago (Graph 42)</span>. The proportion of respondents expecting inflation to be 10 per cent or above almost halved in July, following a few months when over one-third of survey respondents had such an expectation. Currently, more than one-third of respondents expect inflation over the next year to be 2–3 per cent or lower. ", " Business surveys have reported expectations of rising inflation in the near term. Following a pick-up in actual price increases over the past year, the June quarter NAB survey reported an increase in inflation expectations in both the short and medium term (Graph 43). Inflation in actual purchase costs and overheads has also risen in recent quarters, and is expected to rise further in the September quarter. The year-ended inflation rates discernible from the NAB survey remain quite modest, despite the expectations for the September quarter covering the introduction of the GST. Responses to a special question indicate that businesses now expect the GST to add less to product prices by the end of this year than they had expected six months ago. The June quarter ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers suggests that price pressures are picking up noticeably in that sector, with the net balance of manufacturing firms increasing prices remaining at a high level. Medium-term inflation expectations of businesses, as reported in the quarterly NAB survey, have increased over the past year. A clear, although gradual, shift has occurred in respondents' medium-term inflation expectations, with the share of respondents expecting inflation to be less than 3 per cent per annum declining steadily since early last year. ", " Inflation forecasts of private-sector economists for the year to June 2001 continue to edge upwards (Table 15). The median inflation forecast of private-sector economists for the year to June 2001, as surveyed by the Bank following the release of the June quarter CPI, has increased to 5.5 per cent from 5.3 per cent in the March survey. The median estimate of the effect of the tax package on the CPI over the year to June 2001 remains at around 2¾ per cent (in line with the Government's estimate). Hence, excluding the GST, the median forecast has moved up to 2.8 per cent. The first reading of the median forecast of inflation for the year to June 2002 is around 2.3 per cent. ", " Trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), have revised up their forecasts of inflation for the year to June 2001 in recent quarters, reflecting the incorporation of the effect of the GST on prices by more respondents. They expect inflation to remain high in the following year, despite the dropping out of the GST effect on the annual inflation rate. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of financial market participants, measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, have remained relatively stable over the past few months. After reaching a peak of 3¾ per cent in mid January, the implied 10-year inflation expectation fell sharply in the first quarter of the year to a range between 2¾–3 per cent, where it has remained. ", " Inflation pressures have been gradually strengthening, with all measures of inflation now significantly higher than they were a year ago. The CPI increase of 3.2 per cent over the year to the June quarter was slightly above the Bank's target. This was the first time the target has been exceeded since the mid 1990s, but temporary deviations of this nature are allowable in Australia's flexible inflation targeting policy. Measures of core inflation have shown a more gradual, but still quite clear, increase to be running at around 2½ per cent over the latest year, compared with rates of around 1½ per cent at the recent trough. ", " Economy-wide demand conditions, as well as changes in the international price environment, are important forces underlying the shift in inflation. At the same time, a number of particular factors which have also contributed to recent inflation developments will probably prove to have been of a temporary nature. The most important of these has been the increase in international oil prices. This has been reinforced by the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar, such that the combined effect has been an increase in crude oil prices in Australian dollar terms of around 70 per cent over the past year. As a result, petrol prices at the pumps have contributed significantly to CPI inflation over the year and, to a lesser extent, have probably also contributed to some of the pick-up in underlying inflation measures. Other specific factors to have contributed to the CPI increase over the past year have been large increases in insurance and tobacco prices, much of which were tax-related, and house purchase prices, which have been partly driven by strength in housing demand attempting to avoid the GST (and accommodated by easy credit availability). ", " But while these factors are unlikely to continue contributing to inflation to the same degree as they have done over the past year, a number of other sources of inflationary pressure remain in place and may strengthen further. Important near-term influences on prices will be the significant increases in production costs that have occurred recently, arising from higher fuel prices, increases in a range of other commodity prices and the effect of the lower exchange rate on prices of imported inputs. These increases in costs are likely to represent a source of upward pressure on consumer prices in the near future. The lower level of the exchange rate, if sustained, is also likely to generate direct upward pressure on prices of imported and import-competing consumer goods. ", " Of greater importance looking further ahead is the more general influence of economy-wide demand pressures. The economy is now at an advanced stage of its current expansion and has continued to show greater strength than had been generally expected, with real GDP growing at an average annual rate of more than 4½ per cent, and domestic final demand at over 5 per cent, for the past three years. Growth at this pace has exceeded the rate of growth of the economy's productive potential, generating declining unemployment and rising levels of capacity utilisation, and is likely to have contributed to the upstream price pressures described above. While some slowing in the pace of growth in some sectors – such as housing – is likely in the period ahead, there are few signs at present that any slowing in aggregate demand is likely to be particularly pronounced. Overall growth is likely to be at least as high as the economy's long-run potential growth rate. ", " Wage developments remain an important source of uncertainty in assessing the inflation outlook. Over recent years, growth in wages has been quite moderate, and in most of the available data, this continued to be the case in the early part of 2000. Growth in the Wage Cost Index for the year to the March quarter remained low, and enterprise bargaining data for the March quarter showed no change in the average negotiated increase. Average weekly earnings data for May showed a sharp increase in ordinary-time earnings growth, although the quality of this series as an indicator of wage growth over the short term is poor. With output growth likely to remain strong, labour market conditions will probably tighten further. Since wage claims could also be expected to be responsive to the increase in underlying price inflation already observed, wages growth is likely to pick up in the period ahead, though the extent to which this may already be occurring is difficult to assess. ", " The June quarter represents the last CPI figure for some time for which the annual increase will not be heavily affected by the implementation of the GST and related tax changes. Preliminary indications are that the implementation of the tax changes on 1 July proceeded smoothly and that the net tax effects on prices were broadly in line with (or possibly slightly lower than) those suggested by prior estimates. Nonetheless, the CPI will show a sharp upward movement in the September quarter and, in year-ended terms, the CPI increase will remain well above the target until the June quarter 2001. For a period after that, in the second half of 2001, the annual figure may then be held down by lagged effects of some indirect tax reductions. Hence, it will be some time before the CPI will provide a completely unambiguous reading of the annual inflation rate unaffected by the tax changes. Moreover, standard measures of underlying inflation will also be affected by the tax changes during this period (see <a href=\"#box\">Box</a>). ", " As has been stated on a number of occasions, the Bank intends to abstract from the price-level effect of the tax changes and will seek to ensure that ongoing inflation remains consistent with the target once the tax changes have been absorbed. Given the uncertainties as to the exact size and timing of the tax effects, this will require careful judgments to be made as to the contributions of tax effects and ongoing inflationary pressures to CPI outcomes in the coming quarters. ", " The Bank's current assessment is that inflation as measured by either the CPI or underlying measures is likely to be in the upper part of the 2–3 per cent target zone, once these temporary tax effects have passed out of the calculation. This assessment is based on an evaluation of the recent trends in core inflation and likely developments in demand conditions, and takes into account the dampening influence of the monetary policy adjustments since November 1999. The assessment depends importantly on the assumption that there will be no significant second-round wage and price effects arising from the tax changes and that the tax-related increase in the price level does not generate an upward shift in ongoing inflation expectations. While this remains a source of risk, developments so far have been broadly consistent with this assumption. There have been few signs of excessive price increases in response to the tax changes, or of widespread GST-related wage claims. ", " The risk of a more substantial and sustained pick-up in inflation would be heightened if the economy were to expand significantly more quickly than currently envisaged. Risks working in the opposite direction can be identified as well. A weaker global environment could dampen demand pressures in the period ahead, although that appears to have become less likely recently. Strong growth in productivity may continue to restrain growth in unit labour costs to a greater extent than expected, though productivity growth in the past year has been below that in the preceding few years. Finally, were the exchange rate to rise significantly from its recent low levels, that would also help to dampen inflation pressures both directly and indirectly. The balance of risks around the central forecast appears at present to be such that it is more likely that inflation will exceed the forecast, and therefore exceed the target, than that it will fall below it. ", " The introduction of the major elements of the new tax system in July will lead to temporarily higher CPI inflation in the September quarter 2000, followed by a period of time during which reductions in various taxes flowing through to prices will reduce measured inflation. Once the effects of the tax changes on prices have flowed through, inflation is expected to return to rates consistent with the Bank's target, but there will be a permanent effect on the level of the CPI relative to the path that it would otherwise have followed.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnb1\" id=\"rb1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Measures of underlying inflation, which are designed to abstract from the volatility inherent in the CPI, cannot remove the effects of the wide-ranging changes to prices associated with the tax changes. Consequently, all published measures of inflation are expected to increase temporarily in the September quarter. ", " Underlying inflation measures, which, along with the CPI, tend to produce similar average inflation rates over a run of years, fall into two broad categories (Table 1).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnb2\" id=\"rb2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> The first two underlying measures in the table are <em>exclusion-based</em>, with prices that either have a high average volatility, or which are not market-determined, permanently excluded from the CPI basket. The other two measures are based on <em>statistical criteria</em>, which are designed to limit the influence of extreme price changes irrespective of the source. These measures are calculated by excluding a proportion of extreme price changes, but unlike the exclusion-based measures, no judgement needs to be made about which particular items to exclude each period. However, judgement is required as to what <em>proportion</em> of price changes to exclude; the trimmed mean excludes a fixed proportion of items (by weight) at the extremes of the distribution of price changes, while the weighted median excludes all but the middle price change in each period. ", " The tax changes will not necessarily affect the CPI and underlying measures of inflation to the same extent. For the <em>CPI excluding volatile items</em>, the effect of the tax changes can be expected to be slightly larger than for the CPI, as the prices of the excluded items – namely fresh fruit and vegetables and automotive fuel – are not expected to be significantly affected by the tax changes. The net tax effect on the <em>private-sector goods and services</em> measure may be somewhat larger, since a greater proportion of the CPI basket is excluded, for which the net price effect of the tax changes is also expected to be negligible. In the case of the two statistically based measures of underlying inflation, the expected relative impact of the tax changes is less clear. Although we have some idea of the distribution of tax-related price changes across different items of the CPI, this is not sufficient to determine whether the effects on the <em>median</em> and <em>trimmed mean</em> measures of inflation will be greater or less than the total effect on CPI inflation. It is the distribution of <em>overall</em> price changes in the CPI basket – the combination of tax-related price changes and persistent inflation – that will determine the precise effect on the median and trimmed mean. ", " Since all published measures of inflation will be affected by the tax changes, the ABS proposes to calculate a ‘constant tax rate measure’ for the September quarter CPI. In November, the ABS intends to publish the proportion of the change in the September quarter CPI attributable to changes in tax rates between the June and September quarters 2000. The constant tax rate measure can abstract only from the first-round effects of tax changes on prices, arising mainly from the introduction of GST and the removal of WST on final goods.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnb3\" id=\"rb3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 3\">[3]</a></sup> Accordingly, this approach will provide an upper limit of the first-quarter price effect of the tax changes, because it does not take into account the downward influence on prices from reduced transport costs and the removal of WST at intermediate stages of production. However, these second-round effects are not expected to be fully passed through to retail prices in the September quarter, thereby reducing the degree of overestimation. Additional uncertainty in these calculations arises from the assumption that a <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> GST has the same effect on the retail price as a 10 per cent WST, even though the WST is levied at an earlier stage of production and therefore represents a smaller amount of tax for a given tax rate. This provides a possible source of offsetting downward bias in the estimate of the net tax effect. ", " As has been noted in the Bank's policy statements, the Bank will seek to look through the wide-ranging, but temporary, effects of the tax changes on the published measures of inflation. Monetary policy will be based on assessments of developments in ‘ongoing’ inflation – that is, inflation net of the effects of changes to the tax system. Thus, the conduct of monetary policy in coming quarters will require careful interpretation of the data on price developments and assessment of the various estimates of the net tax effect on prices that are available.

While many of the economic statistics have been affected by the impact of unusual events, such as the introduction of the new tax system, and the Olympic Games, the underlying rate of growth of GDP still appears to have been over 4 per cent. This has been associated with fast growth in employment over much of the year, and a significant further decline in the unemployment rate. ", " Conditions have been particularly favourable for Australian exporters, with world economic growth at its strongest for a decade. This strength owes a good deal to the acceleration in the US economy during the first half of the year, but stronger performances in Europe, east Asia and Japan have also contributed. Most commodity prices have firmed in foreign currency terms and, along with the depreciation in the Australian dollar, have contributed to the value of exports rising by 25 per cent over the past year (abstracting from the recording of Olympic effects in the month of September). ", " In 2001, most international forecasters expect some moderation in world growth from the exceptionally strong pace recorded this year. Current indications are that a moderation is indeed occurring, with the clearest evidence for this being the slowing in the US economy since mid year. This slowing is widely seen as desirable in order to forestall possible further increases in US inflation. Provided the other major economies can sustain a good pace of growth in domestic demand, the result will be a moderate decline in overall world growth, and a ‘re-balancing’ between the major economies in a generally beneficial direction. ", " Several risks to the international outlook have been identified, including the effects on growth and inflation from oil prices and the possibility of a disorderly asset market correction in the US. The failure of corporate earnings, particularly of ‘technology’ companies, to meet very optimistic expectations has produced a considerable change in sentiment in global financial markets over recent months. The mood swing has been most pronounced in the US where markets are behaving in a way which indicates that they expect adverse movements in economic and financial conditions. Share prices have weakened, market interest rates, both at the short and long ends of the yield curve, have fallen, credit spreads in debt markets have widened, and new issues of debt and equity in capital markets have slowed. The one aspect of the US economy that has not changed is the behaviour of the US dollar, which has continued to rise strongly against nearly all other major currencies. ", " Some of this change in mood has flowed through to Australian financial markets. But, on the whole, financial conditions here have been much more stable than in the US, looked at in terms of either share prices, interest rates or credit spreads. The relatively better performance of Australian markets has not yet been reflected in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar, perhaps because, as noted, sentiment towards the US dollar has not changed yet. The local currency has fallen by 15 per cent against the US dollar over the past six months or so, but only a little against most other floating currencies of industrial countries – a pattern which leads to the conclusion that most of the fall experienced in the bilateral rate has been a reflection of US dollar strength. ", " Domestic demand in Australia is slowing from its earlier exceptionally rapid pace. Over the year to the June quarter, final demand increased by almost 6 per cent. While it is still proving quite difficult to assess accurately the underlying rate of growth, a more moderate pace is to be expected in the ensuing four quarters. This mainly reflects a fall in spending on dwelling investment following the exceptionally high levels of activity in the first half of 2000 prior to the introduction of the GST, but also some moderation in the pace of growth of public spending. With the boost still being received from the trade sector, this should result in strong growth in GDP over the year ahead, although this at present appears likely to be at a slower pace than the 4¾ per cent average rate of growth over recent years. This outlook is, as always, contingent on the international environment not deteriorating markedly. ", " The September quarter CPI rose by 3.7 per cent, for an increase of 6.1 per cent over the year. The quarterly and annual results are affected by the tax changes, and also by the large rise in the price of petrol. The quarterly result was nonetheless lower than generally expected, and appears to reflect, for the most part, a smaller short-term effect of the tax changes than was considered likely a few months ago. There are no definitive data on the exact impact of the tax changes on the CPI, and the range of measures of core or underlying inflation typically used to assess inflation trends are also affected. But making allowances for them as best it can, the Bank's preliminary assessment is that core inflation, net of tax effects, was of the order of 2¼ per cent over the year to the September quarter. Over the preceding few quarters, annual rates of underlying inflation had been rising, but that trend has not apparently continued in the most recent results. ", " The problem of disentangling the tax effects from ‘ongoing’ price changes may persist for some time yet. The apparently smaller than anticipated impact of the GST may reflect a decision by companies to absorb part of the impact, with the intention of passing it on later. Or it may be that the reduction in prices flowing from the elimination of wholesale sales taxes has occurred more quickly than expected. In either case, future CPI rises would, other things equal, be higher than hitherto expected. Alternatively, it is possible that the original estimates of the GST's effects were too large. ", " Prices appear to have been affected to a relatively small extent, as yet, by the depreciation of the exchange rate. While it usually takes some time for such effects to show up, this result suggests that there may be some squeeze on profit margins for those selling imported products. If so, higher final prices may still be observed in due course, although the experience of recent years is that such effects have tended to be more muted than was the case in earlier times. ", " With all these difficulties of interpretation, assessing the outlook for inflation is unusually difficult. CPI inflation measured on a year-ended basis will remain high until the impact of the tax changes drops out of the annual calculation at this time next year, at which time it will fall back. Whether or not it will be consistent with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> target thereafter will be affected by several considerations, not least the course of oil prices and the exchange rate. At present, the Bank (like most other forecasters) assumes that oil prices will decline somewhat in 2001, helping to bring about a partial reversal of the petrol price impacts on the CPI observed over the past year. ", " On the other hand, the low level of the exchange rate, if it were to persist, would make for upward pressure on inflation, depending on the extent to which foreign suppliers and importers were prepared to accept a reduction in their margins. On the assumption that a substantial degree of pass-through occurred, underlying inflation could be around 3 per cent at the end of next year, with CPI inflation temporarily slightly below that, due to the assumed decline in oil prices. All of this assumes that there will be no response of wages to the GST effects or other factors temporarily pushing up CPI inflation. This assumption still appears to be valid at this time, although it naturally is kept under continual review, as are all assumptions underlying the inflation forecast. ", " With this outlook, the monetary policy decision has been finely balanced, and the Bank has not made a change to interest rates since August. The earlier increases appear to be having some dampening impact on credit demand and some asset markets. The more moderate growth in domestic demand which appears to be in prospect lessens, at the margin, the extent to which inflationary pressures are likely to build over the year ahead. At the same time, the current level of the exchange rate increases the risk that inflation could breach the target, once the direct GST effects have passed. In the period ahead, the Bank will continue to assess the balance of risks to the outlook, and direct policy to the medium-term goal of low inflation, with sustainable growth. ", " The world economy strengthened in the first half of the year, with better than expected outcomes being recorded in all major regions, including Australia's major trading partners. As a result, forecasts for world output growth were revised higher by many commentators, including the IMF who are expecting world output growth of 4.7 per cent in 2000 – half a percentage point higher than expected six months earlier (Table 1, Graph 1).The IMF expects world growth to slow in 2001, as growth in the US slows from around 5 per cent to 3 per cent, but still remain above its long-term average. ", " The process of upward revision to expectations for the world economy that has been occurring over the past two years appears to have run its course, with some commentators suggesting higher risks of a substantial slowdown in 2001 than that currently expected. ", " One risk to the outlook, identified by the IMF, is the possibility of a disorderly adjustment in international equity and foreign exchange markets. In addition to the adverse effects on the advanced economies, such developments could also jeopardise the recoveries in the emerging market economies. Another risk is a sustained high price for oil, which has recently reached its highest level since the Gulf war. The IMF estimates that world growth in 2001 could be up to half a percentage point lower if oil prices remain above US$31 per barrel, instead of declining as projected. <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a> examines the likely effects of a sustained higher level of oil prices in some detail. ", " Primarily as a result of higher oil prices, consumer price inflation has picked up to around 2¼ per cent in the advanced economies over the year to August 2000, from around 1½ per cent a year earlier. However, abstracting from the direct influence of oil, inflation remains generally subdued despite the strong growth of the world economy. ", " The US economy continues to grow at a strong pace despite GDP growth easing in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">September quarter</span> (Graph 2). The effects of the 175 basis points increase in the Fed funds rate since June last year have been evident in the housing sector, and the added effects of higher oil prices and the appreciation in the exchange rate have contributed to a slowdown in the part of the manufacturing sector which is not involved in producing computer-related goods. But growth in household consumption remains robust, and export growth has also been strong over the past year, despite the appreciation of the exchange rate. Reflecting the ongoing strength of demand, the current account deficit widened to around 4¼ per cent of GDP in the June quarter. ", " While consumption has eased from its very rapid pace of growth earlier in the year, it is still growing strongly, supported by the high level of consumer confidence, and the tightness of the labour market. Household incomes have been bolstered by the pick-up in wages growth over the past year: the Employment Cost Index rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.9 per cent</span> in the September quarter and is now 4¼ per cent higher than a year ago. Against this, the decline in share prices over the course of this year should reduce the impetus to household spending from wealth gains that has occurred over the past few years, though wealth still remains at a high level. ", " Much of the growth in business investment over the past year has come from increased spending on computer equipment and software, and orders for IT capital equipment point to continued rapid growth in investment in the near term. Output growth of the computer-related sector has also been an important contributor to growth in industrial production in recent quarters: while total manufacturing production increased by 6¼ per cent over the year to September, growth excluding computer-related output was just under 1 per cent. The National Association of Purchasing Managers' survey suggests that the outlook for the non-IT manufacturing sector is not particularly favourable. ", " Consumer price inflation picked up to 3½ per cent over the year to September, principally due to higher <span class=\"no-wrap\">oil prices (Graph 3)</span>. To date, the increase in energy prices has had only a limited effect on core measures of inflation, which have increased by around half a percentage point from the second half of last year, but have remained at an annualised rate of around 2½ per cent in recent months. The absence of any significant increase in core inflation has been aided by the appreciation of the US dollar and subdued growth in unit labour costs – while wages growth has picked up, this has been matched by increases in productivity. ", " The recovery in Japan appears to have consolidated in the first half of the year, with the national accounts recording an increase in GDP of 1 per cent in the June quarter following growth of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> in March. Private consumption and exports both contributed significantly to growth in the first half of the year (Table 2). Alternative measures of activity paint a similar picture of economic recovery (Graph 4). The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's overall business activity index increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> over the six months to August. The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey also continued to indicate improved prospects for business. Despite these positive developments, risks remain: recent developments in the financial sector may restrict the amount of intermediated funding available to business, and the pick-up in consumption growth may be limited by the slow growth of household incomes. ", " The latest Tankan survey suggests that the recovery in business investment is likely to continue. The survey reported an improvement in business confidence, a pick-up in capital expenditure intentions and more positive perceptions about access to finance. In addition, exporters have benefited from the recovery in east Asia – exports to that region increased by 21 per cent over the year to September. ", " The outlook for consumption is more uncertain. Consumption spending appears to have weakened after growing strongly in the first half of the year. Household incomes have only grown slightly over the year to September because of a decline in employment and weak growth in wages. Nevertheless, consumers are more confident about their employment prospects and the economy generally, despite the historically high unemployment rate. ", " The government's expansionary fiscal stance is set to continue in the near term, with the announcement of a further supplementary budget – to be finalised this month – which will contain additional spending of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.8 per cent</span> of GDP. The size of the planned package is relatively modest, but should help to ensure that public expenditure does not significantly reduce growth in the period ahead. ", " Consumer prices continued to fall on a year-ended basis, declining by 0.8 per cent over the year to September. The sustained strength of the yen and comparatively efficient energy consumption have helped to offset the inflationary pressures stemming from the increase in oil prices. ", " The Bank of Japan raised the overnight call rate to 0.25 per cent in August, terminating the zero interest rate policy that had been in place since February last year. In reaching this decision, the Bank cited the decreased risk of deflationary problems as the economic recovery, led by the pick-up in business investment, continued. The Bank of Japan still expects prices to fall slightly over the year to March 2001. ", " The strong growth experienced in non-Japan Asia in 1999 has continued into 2000, with GDP in the region increasing by 8 per cent at an annualised rate over the first half of the year (Table 3). In some countries, most notably Korea, there are signs that growth may be starting to ease back to a more sustainable pace, after the very rapid expansion in the initial phase of recovery. Exports and then consumption provided the initial stimulus to growth in the aftermath of the crisis. Now a recovery in private investment is also underway in all countries in the region except Indonesia and the Philippines. ", " Nonetheless, there remain significant divergences in economic performances across the region (Graph 5). One source of this divergence is the difference in export composition, particularly in terms of electronic goods. In Malaysia, electronic goods account for over 30 per cent of exports, while they represent only around 3 per cent in Indonesia. Much of the pick-up in industrial production in Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan since early 1999 has been in the electronics sector (Graph 6). While these three economies remain vulnerable to any slowdown in the global electronics market, Indonesia, and to a lesser extent, Thailand have not benefited from the strong global demand for electronic goods. ", " Another cause of the divergent economic performance has been the varying sizes of the required financial and corporate restructuring and the extent of progress that has been made. The World Bank estimates that in Indonesia and Thailand, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans has fallen to 40 per cent and <span class=\"no-wrap\">32 per cent (as at June 2000)</span>, but is still well above estimates for Korea and Malaysia (12 per cent and <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span> respectively). The fragile state of the banking sectors in Indonesia and Thailand is making it difficult for banks to provide new finance to the private sector and therefore may be retarding the speed of their recoveries. ", " Inflation has edged up throughout the region, in large part the result of higher oil prices. Consequently, some countries have begun tightening monetary policy. The Bank of Korea raised its key interest rate by <span class=\"no-wrap\">¼ of a per cent</span> in October – the first rise in eight months. Although inflation has picked up from its low levels of 1999, core inflation remains within the Bank's newly established target for inflation of 2.5 per cent ± 1 percentage point. ", " After strong growth in the second half of 1999, the New Zealand economy contracted slightly in the first half of 2000 (Graph 7). Much of the weakness has been in domestic demand, reflecting subdued private consumption and, in the June quarter, a 23 per cent decline in housing investment. Business confidence has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and is around its lowest level in ten years; consumer confidence has also fallen considerably. In contrast, employment growth rebounded strongly in the September quarter and the export sector remains robust, underpinned by strong external demand, the lower New Zealand dollar and a good agricultural season. ", " In the euro area, output grew strongly for the fourth consecutive quarter in June, increasing by 0.8 per cent, to be 3.7 per cent higher over the year. Export growth has continued to benefit from the depreciation of the euro, and has helped underpin the recovery in employment and solid growth in consumption in the region over the past year. Inflation has been boosted by the rise in oil prices to be 2.8 per cent higher over the year to September. Core inflation, at 1.4 per cent over the year, has risen only slightly, while growth in labour costs remains contained. Reflecting ongoing concern over oil prices, import costs and strength of the euro-area economy, the ECB raised interest rates on two occasions over the past three months by a total of half a percentage point. ", " In the UK, GDP has continued to grow at a solid pace over the past year. Growth in recent years has been underpinned by steady consumption growth, driven by robust growth in employment and earnings, as well as high levels of consumer confidence. Exports have also picked up strongly through the past year. While consumer prices have increased by over 3 per cent in the past year, underlying inflation is more subdued and remains below the Bank of England's target rate of 2.5 per cent. ", " The process of global monetary tightening that began in the United States in June last year has slowed over recent months (Graph 8 and Table 4). After raising the Fed funds target by 175 basis points to 6.5 per cent in the 12 months to May 2000, the Federal Reserve has since left US rates unchanged, as signs have emerged that growth of aggregate demand in the US has slowed. Financial markets have begun to price in the possibility that US official interest rates could start to fall in early 2001 (Graph 9). ", " Of the other English-speaking countries: the Bank of England has not raised rates since February, after four increases of 25 basis points in the preceding 9 months, which lifted rates to 6 per cent, and the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have left rates unchanged, at 5.75 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively, since May. ", " In Europe, where the level of official interest rates was, and still is, well below that in English-speaking countries, official interest rates have continued to rise in recent months. Since the US Federal Reserve's last move in May, the European Central Bank has increased overnight rates by a further 100 basis points, to 4.75 per cent, taking the total tightening so far in this cycle to 225 basis points. The 50-point increase in June, followed by 25 basis points in both September and October has narrowed the spread with the US to 175 basis points. ", " The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised overnight interest rates in August as concerns about deflation and the sustainability of the recovery had ameliorated sufficiently for the overnight call rate to be raised from zero to <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.25 per cent</span>. The rise was the first since 1994, and was widely anticipated. In making the announcement, the BoJ noted that it was ending what was considered an ‘extraordinary’ policy, and that the increase should not be taken as the beginning of a tightening cycle. ", " There have been some increases in interest rates in some other Asian countries also. Building inflationary pressures led the Bank of Korea to raise official interest rates by a further 25 basis points in October, to 5.25 per cent, following a previous tightening of the same magnitude in February. The Philippine central bank raised official interest rates by 500 basis points over September and October in an effort to slow the depreciation of the peso against the US dollar. With political uncertainty eroding confidence in financial markets, market interest rates increased by much more – around 20 percentage points – to levels higher than during the Asian financial crisis. ", " Bond yields in the US have generally fallen over recent months (Graph 10). An important factor seemed to be the changing outlook for the economy and monetary policy. Yields on US 10-year Treasury notes fell around 60 basis points to 5.70 per cent between end May and early September, and have since fluctuated within a narrow range. This level is about 65 points below the current US cash rate. Normally, such an inverse yield curve would be taken to indicate that markets are expecting quite a pronounced slowing or even contraction in the economy. On this occasion, however, other factors seem to be at work, which make it harder to interpret the implications of movements in yields. One of these is the continuing budget surpluses in the US and the resulting falls in the supply of bonds on issue. Another factor is rising risk aversion among investors, which is adding to demand for government bonds. Yields on private sector bonds have not fallen as much as those on government bonds; while AAA corporates have fallen over recent months, they remain above the Fed funds target. However, bonds issued by borrowers of low credit standing have risen significantly. ", " European bond yields have generally been more stable, with the 10-year German yield moving between 5.10 and 5.35 per cent since June. Japanese long bond yields increased around the time of the tightening in Japanese monetary policy, but have since been steady at just above 1.8 per cent. ", " In emerging markets, bond yields have been rising, with the spread to US bond yields widening sharply, to around 800 basis points in early November from a low of around 630 basis points earlier in the year. ", " The prospect of slower economic growth and market disappointment with earnings announcements, particularly by ‘technology’ companies in the US, have weighed on equity markets over recent months. Looking through the volatility, overseas markets have fallen in recent months (Graph 11), with the lead clearly coming from <span class=\"no-wrap\">the US (Graph 12)</span>. After surging to an all time high in March, the Nasdaq is now down 32 per cent from its peak and a net 16 per cent for the year. The Wilshire index, the broadest measure of US share prices (accounting for over 90 per cent of listed companies) is down by 3 per cent for the year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by around 5 per cent. These broadly-based indexes of share prices in the US are now showing little net change over a period of at least 12 months. This is the first time since the mid 1990s that there has been no net change in US share prices over a twelve-month period (Table 5). ", " Despite the falls in US share prices, the traditional measure of share valuations – P/E ratios – remain significantly higher than average. For the S&amp;P 500 index, for example, the current P/E ratio is 28, down from a peak of 36 in May 1999, but still well above the long run average of about 16. In the case of the Nasdaq, the average P/E ratio is still around 100. ", " Share prices in countries such as Hong Kong, Canada, Germany and Japan, where market indices are heavily influenced by the technology sector, are down sharply over recent months. The share market in Australia has been resilient in the face of these overseas trends (see Chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’). ", " Falls in the emerging Asian share markets this year have been very pronounced, with most of the decline concentrated in the Initial Crisis Economies – specifically Indonesia, Korea and Thailand. Share prices in these countries have dropped by an average of over 40 per cent since the start of 2000 and are now not much above the low point reached during the crisis. Financial markets assess these economies as vulnerable to a slowing in world growth, in part because their financial sectors are still recovering from the crisis. Share markets in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Latin America</span> have held up much better than those in Asia, weakening only modestly this year. ", " The US dollar has continued to rise on a trade-weighted basis in recent months, even though the factors that were used to explain its strength earlier in the year – strong US asset markets, a strengthening economy and rising interest rates – no longer apply (Graph 13). This raises questions about the extent to which the rise has become simply a reflection of trend-following or momentum trading. The strength of the US dollar has been most pronounced against the euro, but was also evident against other major currencies with the exception of the yen. ", " The weakening of the euro against the US dollar triggered a round of intervention by G7 countries in support of the euro in mid September, after the euro had fallen very quickly to record low levels and appeared to be the subject of ‘one-way bet’ speculation in financial markets (Graph 14). ", " The European Central Bank followed up with further intervention, this time unilaterally, in early November. This intervention seems to have helped steady the euro which is now trading around levels at which the ECB first intervened. ", " In contrast to the variability in the euro/US dollar exchange rate, the Japanese yen has continued to trade in a tight range against the US dollar. Elsewhere in Asia, the countries with floating exchange rates have depreciated against the US dollar, though to varying degrees. Some currencies, such as the Singapore dollar, are down only a little, but others have fallen significantly. The biggest falls were in the Philippines, where political uncertainty undermined confidence and the peso fell by 22 per cent from its level at the start of the year, and in Indonesia where the rupiah fell by 24 per cent. General US dollar strength was also reflected in a depreciation of floating currencies in Latin America. ", " In the period during which it has been floating, the Australian dollar has shown quite large medium-term movements in both directions (Graph 15). The fall during 2000 was the fourth time it has moved down by a significant amount, but the first time it has done so without the presence of a significant negative external shock such as a fall in commodity prices, a world recession or a contraction amongst our major regional trading partners. What stands out about the current fall is that it has occurred at the time when Australia's international trading environment remains very robust, and was therefore generally unexpected. As a consequence, there has been much conjecture as to its causes. ", " Analysis of the factors causing changes in exchange rates is often difficult because the influences on the demand for currencies are ill-defined and variable. Nonetheless, when looking at the causal factors in the Australian dollar's fall this year, some patterns emerge. In the first seven months of the year, changes in the exchange rate tended to be concentrated into a relatively small number of abrupt moves, and were associated with economic news which were interpreted as changing the growth outlook for Australia and the US, and therefore actual and expected interest rate differentials. More recently, the fall in the exchange rate has tended to be characterised by a series of smaller but persistent declines, and not associated with any particular pieces of economic news. The events of the past year are therefore best analysed in terms of these two phases. ", " As noted, during this phase changing expectations of interest differentials between Australia and the US seem to have played an important role in the fall of the Australian dollar. The significance of economic news and interest rates emerges clearly when the large individual moves in the exchange rate are examined in detail. For example, from the first sharp fall in the exchange rate in late January through to July, there were ten occasions when the exchange rate moved by more than US0.70 cents in a day. Seven of these moves were falls, and in total they accounted for virtually all the net fall in the exchange rate over the period. All but two of these moves in the exchange rate came after economic news which changed market assessments of the growth outlook for either Australia or the US, and therefore expectations of future interest rate differentials. For example, weak economic data on Australia caused market participants to lower their expectations of future Australian economic growth and inflation, and therefore the likelihood of a rise in Australian interest rates. In turn, this meant that the expected interest rate differential relative to the US moved in favour of the US dollar, resulting in sales of Australian dollars and purchases of US dollars. <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> summarises the factors that were reported to be linked to each of the large moves in the exchange rate. ", " Other pieces of evidence supporting this interpretation of events can be found from graphs of the relevant variables. When data on the expected growth differential, the expected cash rate or the long-term bond differential between the two countries are plotted against the exchange rate, a clear relationship emerges during the first seven or so months of 2000. During this period, for example, forecasts of the growth differential between Australia and the US prepared by Consensus Economics were revised down progressively. Whereas in January it was expected that Australian growth in 2000 would exceed US growth by 0.3 of a percentage point, by mid year it was expected that US growth would exceed Australian growth by 1 percentage point (Graph 16). ", " Against this background, not surprisingly, market expectations of the cash rate differential were also revised down sharply during this period (Graph 17). Similar sentiment was reflected in a decline in the bond spread between Australia and the US, from about 60 points at the start of the year to close to zero mid year (Graph 18). These adjustments went hand in hand with the fall in the exchange rate. ", " Through the early part of this period, a lot of the fall in the exchange rate reflected independent weakness of the Australian dollar, so that the bilateral rate against the US dollar and the trade-weighted index moved similarly. From late April, however, the continued fall of the Australian dollar against the US dollar became more a reflection of the strength of the latter, following a run of very strong economic data in the US and a tightening of 50 basis points by the Fed, a bigger move than its earlier increases of 25 points. Similarly, the recovery of the Australian dollar in June was again largely a reflection of movements in the US dollar, this time a weakening. This followed a run of softer US data which caused the earlier upward revisions to expectations of US interest rates to be unwound. From late April through June, the trade-weighted index of the Australian dollar was much steadier than the bilateral rate against the US dollar. ", " In net terms, over the whole period from January to July, the Australian dollar fell by about 11 per cent against the US dollar and by about 6 per cent in trade-weighted terms. ", " In the period since August, the exchange rate of the Australian dollar has fallen further, by about 9 per cent against the US dollar and 7 per cent against the trade-weighted index (Graph 19). While the net fall is nearly as large as that which took place over the first seven months of the year, in this latest episode there have been only three large daily falls, and they account for only about one-third of the net move over the period. As noted, most of the fall in the exchange rate has come about because of a series of small but persistent daily falls. ", " Perhaps reflecting this pattern, market dealers have been less able to pinpoint the factors driving the exchange rate. Explanations have been varied and somewhat inconsistent. Also, there has been increased recourse to explanations based on chartist behaviour and market dynamics such as trend-following or momentum trading. ", " Interest rates have become much less important in explaining exchange rate moves. Movements in interest rate differentials, either the expected cash rate differential or the bond differential, have reversed some of the falls earlier in the year (Graphs 17 and 18). Most of this adjustment to the interest rate relativities has come from the US side, with economic data tending to confirm that the US economy has slowed. Market expectations of where US short-term interest rates will be in mid 2001 have been lowered by more than 100 basis points since their peak in May, with the market now pricing in the possibility that the next change in US monetary policy will be an easing. In contrast, expectations for Australian interest rates are little changed, so the differential has moved in a direction favourable to the Australian dollar. ", " Despite the changed outlook for US interest rates, the US dollar continued to rise for most of the period. All currencies apart from the yen fell against it. The euro/US dollar exchange rate fell to new lows almost daily in September, sterling reached 15-year lows, and both the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar exchange rates also hit new lows against the US dollar. ", " With many currencies falling simultaneously against the US dollar, correlations between the Australian dollar and some other currencies have increased recently. This was particularly the case for the euro, against which a relationship had already started to emerge in the first half of the year. This relationship has recently strengthened, with the correlation of daily movements increasing to 0.49, twice its first-half reading. The close relationship with the euro has caused widespread puzzlement because, traditionally, the two currencies had not been related, and the cyclical positions of the respective economies, as well as their overall structure, do not indicate any reason for such a close relationship. ", " In recent weeks, with the US dollar levelling out in trade-weighted terms and the euro rising, helped in part by central bank intervention, the Australian dollar too has started to stabilise. In net terms, the Australian dollar's exchange rate against the US dollar has shown little change since mid October, while the TWI has shown little change since early October. ", " Because developments in the Australian dollar over recent months have mainly reflected international factors rather than domestic events, the case for independent action by the Reserve Bank to try to avert its fall seemed rather limited for much of the period. In recent weeks, however, the Bank has entered the market on several occasions to support the exchange rate and reinforce the emerging tendency towards stability. ", " The Australian economy has continued to grow strongly, although the introduction of the GST in the middle of the year and the staging of the Olympics Games in September have made interpreting recent data more difficult than usual. Over the year to the June quarter, real output expanded by around 4¾ per cent (Graph 20), and most indicators suggest that further solid growth occurred in the September quarter. The composition of growth, however, has clearly changed during the last year. Consumer spending has slowed from the very strong rates of growth recorded in 1999, while export growth has accelerated (Table 6). ", " The rate of growth of the economy in the first half of the year is likely to have been boosted by the introduction of the GST on 1 July, as some spending on goods whose prices were expected to be increased by the change in taxation arrangements was brought forward from the second half of the year. The largest transitional effects have clearly been in the housing sector, which recorded extraordinary levels of activity in the first half of 2000, and for which forward indicators imply that a sharp slowing is in train. The net impact on consumer spending and purchases of investment goods, by contrast, appears to have been small. In the September quarter, the Olympics are likely to have provided a further net boost to output. ", " Over the first half of 2000, consumer spending grew at an annual rate of around 2½ per cent, less than half the rate of growth recorded in the second half of 1999. Underlying these figures was a fall in expenditure on goods and a slowdown in the rate of growth of expenditure on services. Some moderation in growth from the high rates experienced in the second half of 1999 was expected, given that monetary policy has been progressively tightened since November last year, and the gains in wealth, which have probably boosted consumption spending over the past couple of years, have slowed. The rise in petrol prices over the past year could have also contributed to this slowdown in consumer spending, as some households may have curtailed their expenditures on other goods and services. ", " The indicators of consumer spending around the middle of the year were, as expected, very volatile, as consumers responded to the relative price changes caused by the change in the indirect taxation system <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 21)</span>. Overall, and despite survey evidence suggesting that consumers were not well informed about the details of the tax package, consumers' responses to the anticipated changes in relative prices were broadly as expected. In the month immediately preceding the tax change, large increases were recorded in sales of items whose prices were expected to rise, such as clothing and footwear, with sales being correspondingly weaker in July. These effects were amplified by the decision made by a number of major retailers to hold their mid-year sales in June, rather than July. Sales of motor vehicles, by contrast, were subdued through much of the first half of the year, in anticipation of lower prices after 1 July, and then boosted in July and August. Once again, these swings were amplified by the manufacturers' decisions to delay the launch of a number of new models onto the Australian market until after 1 July. Little transitional effect on sales was evident for goods, such as food items, the prices of which were not expected to be affected by the tax changes. By international standards the distortions to consumer spending were relatively small. ", " In net terms, consumer demand was brought forward in anticipation of the tax changes, and this resulted in a decline in retail sales in the September quarter in real terms, after the strong growth recorded in the June quarter. Looking through the mid-year volatility, consumer spending appears to be continuing to grow quite well. In September, the value of retail sales was 4.2 per cent higher than in May, the last month for which data appear to have been relatively unaffected by the tax changes. With retail prices up by around 3 per cent over <span class=\"no-wrap\">that period (including tax effects)</span>, this would imply growth in real terms of around one per cent. Sales in September were boosted in some areas by the Olympics, with sales in New South Wales particularly strong in the month. At the same time, Olympic-related spending by consumers and their tendency to stay at home during the Olympics may have temporarily dampened other areas of expenditure such as in restaurants and department stores. The overall impact of the Games on the retail sales data therefore remains unclear. ", " Consumer sentiment has fluctuated over quite a wide range since the beginning of the year, possibly reflecting a number of factors including uncertainties about the tax changes, higher interest rates and financial market volatility. In aggregate consumer sentiment, after recovering strongly in the middle of the year when much of the uncertainty about the tax package was resolved, has weakened again in recent months and remains lower than levels recorded a year ago. Most components of the survey, however, remain around their long-run averages and would be consistent with continued moderate growth in consumer spending. ", " Household disposable income grew by a little over 2 per cent in the June quarter, reflecting increases in wage and salary earnings and an increase in dividends received by households, and the household saving ratio increased to 3.4 per cent, its highest level since June 1997 (Graph 22). The reductions in personal income taxes and increases in social benefits since 1 July imply that stronger growth in disposable income is likely to be recorded in the September quarter. The demutualisation of the NRMA could provide a small boost to household spending, as it has made a small proportion of household wealth more liquid, although it is only worth around $4½ billion or <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span> of total household assets. To some extent this may be offset by the payment deadline for Telstra 2 instalment receipts, which could also have been a cash-flow consideration for some households. ", " Household assets have continued to rise, increasing by 3 per cent in the June quarter, and 12 per cent over the last year, although growth has moderated from the very rapid pace recorded in 1999 (Table 7). Increases in the value of both dwellings and financial assets have contributed to the latest rise. The estimated value of dwellings rose by just under 4 per cent in the June quarter, more than reversing a fall in March. This was driven by increases in dwelling prices in all capital cities and most country areas but, as discussed below, these figures may have been boosted by compositional effects which are likely to be unwound in the September quarter. Household financial asset holdings increased by 2 per cent in the June quarter, driven by both net acquisitions of shares and increases in share prices. ", " Households are continuing to increase their indebtedness, although this too has moderated in recent months. An acceleration in housing credit, probably fuelled by attempts to expedite payments ahead of the GST, took growth to an annual rate of above 19 per cent over the six months to June. Since then it has eased back to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> over the six months to September. Personal credit growth has also moderated slightly since earlier in the year but remains strong at around 14 per cent on a six-month-annualised basis. Within this component, margin lending has slowed, perhaps reflecting the more mixed performance in equity markets. ", " The effect of the tightening in monetary policy since last November is clearly evident in household interest payments. In the June quarter, the household interest burden increased to be 7.1 per cent of household disposable income, which is slightly above the recent peak recorded in late 1995 (Graph 23). This rise has reflected increases in nominal interest rates and a larger household debt burden. The ratio of household debt to income increased to around 103 per cent of disposable income in June, up from around 98 per cent at end 1999. Despite the increase in household debt, the ratio of household debt to assets has remained steady at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> for the past four years, which implies little change in the leverage of households. Information on housing loans in arrears provides another indication of the impact of recent interest rate increases on households. Housing loans in arrears still remain very low, accounting for only one-third of one per cent of all housing loans outstanding, although they increased in the June quarter after trending downwards for the past three years. ", " Household spending on dwellings reached record levels as a percentage of GDP in the first half of the year; private dwelling investment grew by 10 per cent in the June quarter and by 23 per cent over the year. The strong growth in dwelling investment in the first half of the year appears to have been strongly influenced by the incentive to complete as much work as possible prior to the introduction of the GST. This factor reinforced a housing upswing that had already been underway. ", " The unwinding of the pre-GST surge, combined with the dampening effects of rising interest rates and higher house prices on affordability, are evident in the leading indicators of dwelling activity (Graph 24). Private building approvals have fallen for the past eight months, and are 47 per cent below the January peak. The recent falls have been driven by approvals for houses, which had experienced the strongest growth in the second half of 1999. The value of loan approvals has also been falling sharply, although a modest rise in August (for both <span class=\"no-wrap\">owner-occupiers</span> and investors) suggests that the outlook may be stabilising. Total loan approvals are now <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> lower than their peak, or 9 per cent lower than a year ago. The declines in loan approvals and building approvals from their recent peaks have been about the same as those that occurred in the mid 1990s. ", " All states have experienced both the exceptionally strong growth in building approvals over 1999 and the sharp declines more recently. The pick-up was strongest in Melbourne and Adelaide, which had experienced relatively low levels of dwelling investment earlier in the decade, while the recent weakening has been sharpest in NSW, which had been investing at a very high rate for several years. A similar pattern is evident in the state loan approvals data (Table 8). ", " The housing sector will clearly subtract from growth of domestic demand over the coming year, primarily due to the unwinding of the GST-related surge in investment. In the near-term, however, the increased presence of first home buyers in the market after 1 July should see renewed interest at the lower end of the market. In the months prior to the introduction of the GST, the share of loan approvals attributed to first home buyers reached record lows, but then rebounded to 24 per cent in July, and has since stayed around that level. This pattern has reflected the incentive for first home buyers to delay purchases until after 1 July when they would be eligible to receive the Commonwealth Government's first home-owners' grant. ", " Despite the recent surge in housing construction activity, it appears unlikely that this will lead to a large build-up of excess supply in the sector. While the current housing cycle, as measured by dwelling investment as a share of GDP, has exceeded the strength of previous cycles, this is because much of the strength of the current upturn has been due to consumers building bigger and better dwellings (Graph 25) and spending more on alterations and additions. The number of dwellings commenced, even including the recent build-up, remains well below the levels of the two previous cycles. Other indicators of excess supply, such as vacancy rates and rental rates also suggest that, at this stage, there is little evidence of over-investment in housing. Rents have, if anything, been increasing across most capital cities, and although vacancy rates have increased in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, they remain at historically moderate levels. ", " House prices continued to rise through the middle of the year. Established house prices, as measured by both the REIA and the ABS, grew strongly in the June quarter after having softened earlier in the year. The latest figures may, however, have been boosted by compositional change, as the withdrawal of first home buyers from the market may have led to lower than usual turnover at the cheaper end of the market. To the extent that this is the case, these aggregate price measures will be correspondingly weaker in the September quarter. There are also signs that house prices more generally may be softening due to the weaker demand conditions now prevailing in the sector. ", " While the economy has grown strongly over the past year, conditions have varied quite widely across industries. The impact of the pick-up in world economic growth and the depreciation of the currency has been particularly evident in the mining sector, which has been the fastest growing sector over the past year with real output rising by 13 per cent (Graph 26). Growth in the output of black coal, iron ore and gold were particularly strong recently. The communications sector continued to grow rapidly, underpinned by the development of mobile telephone and fibre optic networks. Output growth in the services sector has also been buoyant. Property and business services, reflecting, inter alia, work associated with the implementation of the GST, as well as finance and insurance services, added to the strong gains earlier in the year, growing in aggregate by over 2 per cent in the June quarter and by 7 per cent over the year. Construction output rose only moderately as the very strong growth in dwelling construction was partly offset by falls in non-residential building work and engineering construction. ", " Recent business surveys suggest that trading conditions and levels of confidence have declined from the high levels seen at the end of last year. Both the NAB survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey recorded a softening in trading conditions in the first half of the year, with some pick-up occurring in the September quarter (Graph 27). The surveys suggest that perceived trading conditions remain close to or above their long-run averages. Not surprisingly, the expectations for export demand remain strong. Trading conditions for the mining sector have continued to improve after a period when confidence in the industry had been low. According to the Yellow Pages survey, confidence of small businesses also declined sharply in the first half of the year, although much of that decline was reversed in the September quarter. ", " Business investment has continued to be volatile from quarter to quarter, around a modest upward trend <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 28)</span>, with a decline in buildings and structures investment being offset by growth in the other components. Investment in machinery and equipment fell by just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> in the June quarter, but is <span class=\"no-wrap\">13½ per    cent</span> higher over the year. The outlook for machinery and equipment investment, according to the latest ABS Capital Expenditure Survey, is for further growth in the year ahead, though at a fairly modest pace. Firms have upgraded their machinery and equipment investment plans slightly for 2000/01 to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ per cent</span> growth in nominal terms. This is likely to have been boosted by the introduction of input tax credits as part of the tax reform process, though offsetting this, some investment intentions may have been dampened by the increased cost of imported capital goods on account of the depreciation of the Australian dollar. ", " Investment in new buildings and other structures has been on a downward trend for the past year and a half. This trend continued into the June quarter, with buildings and structures investment falling by 3 per cent, as several large engineering projects were completed. Forward indicators for non-residential building activity, which accounts for about 60 per cent of investment in buildings and structures, have been more positive. The value of private non-residential building approvals in the June and September quarters was about 5 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. The increase was concentrated in offices and shops. The pick-up in approvals in offices has been supported by strong demand conditions in most major CBD office property markets, where average vacancy rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the late 1980s. Demand for new office space is particularly strong in Sydney and Melbourne, where there have been limited new completions in recent years, and where there has been a withdrawal of a considerable amount of office space due to strong demand for residential city properties. The strength in shops relates largely to refurbishments. ", " Engineering construction, which accounts for the remaining 40 per cent of investment in buildings and structures, has been particularly weak. Spending is one-third below its peak in December 1998, due largely to weakness in investment by the mining sector. Forward indicators, such as private sector commencements, work-yet-to-be done and the listing of projects in the Access Investment Monitor, point to subdued activity in the immediate future. On the other hand, the strength in commodity prices in Australian dollar terms, and the correspondingly high level of profitability of the mining sector, would appear to provide a more positive outlook if these conditions are sustained. ", " The other major component of business investment, expenditure on intangible fixed assets, fell in the June quarter, but has increased by 14 per cent over the past year. Falls in both computer software and minerals exploration contributed to the decline in the quarter, although this weakness appears unlikely to persist. In coming periods, mineral and petroleum exploration expenditures should be encouraged by the record high commodity prices in Australian dollar terms. ", " Total investment in computer hardware and software and other electronic equipment has continued to increase, as a share of GDP, in recent years. Private investment of this nature was over 3½ per cent of GDP in 1999/00, almost double its level of a decade earlier, and has been increasing at broadly the same rate as in the US <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 29)</span>. The lower recorded level of investment in Australia is, in part, related to the fact that some of Australia's telecommunications sector remains in majority public ownership and hence is not incorporated in these figures. By industry, investment in hardware and electronic equipment, as well as growth in this investment, has been concentrated in the communications, and property and finance services industries (Table 9). ", " The profitability of the corporate sector overall remains high. Although growth in corporate profits moderated in the June quarter, profits as a share of GDP remained around 16 per cent, well above the historical average <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 30)</span>. Corporate net interest paid rose by only 2 per cent, so profits after interest also remained strong. The business sector's raisings of external finance also picked up further in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">June quarter (Graph 31)</span>. Debt raising activity was particularly strong, both through intermediaries and markets. ", " More recently, however, growth in external funding has moderated a little. Overall business credit growth eased to an annualised rate of around 9 per cent over the 6 months to September, around the same pace as was recorded in March. On the markets, the net amount raised through debt and equity also appears to have eased; firms are continuing to return surplus capital through equity buy-back activity. This moderation in external funding could imply that the interest rate increases have started to affect corporate funding and investment decisions. Since internal sources of funding have remained strong, corporates might, in particular, have taken the opportunity to reduce gearing. The GST and Olympic games, however, may also have influenced the timing of funding activity. ", " Over the year to the September quarter, employment increased by 3½ per cent, with the gains in employment shared fairly evenly between full-time and part-time positions. Much of the recent strength in employment growth has been in private-sector services, reflecting the relatively strong growth in output of these industries. The most recent monthly figures have shown some volatility in aggregate employment and suggest that some easing in employment growth may now be occurring from the very high rates seen earlier in the year. Nonetheless, labour market conditions overall remain strong. ", " The strength in employment growth has seen the unemployment rate fall by almost a full percentage point over the past year, with some increase in the participation rate also helping to meet the growing demand for <span class=\"no-wrap\">labour (Graph 32)</span>. The unemployment rate averaged 6.3 per cent in the September quarter, its lowest level in a decade. At the same time, the participation rate rose to historically high levels. This resulted from an increase in the female participation rate of 1½ percentage points over the past 18 months, presumably buoyed by the recent labour market strength, after remaining flat for the previous three years. ", " Employment growth has been strongest in New South Wales and Victoria, although most States have continued to record above-trend growth in employment and declining unemployment rates (Table 10). The strength of employment in New South Wales does not appear to have been directly due to the Olympic Games. A rescheduling of the September labour force survey in New South Wales avoided much of the disturbance arising from the direct employment effects of the Games, and, although employment growth was quite strong in Sydney immediately prior to the Games, it was not unusually so. Overall, employment has grown as strongly outside the major capital cities as within them over the past year, with commensurate declines in the rates of unemployment. However, substantial differences persist between regions, with the average unemployment rate in non-metropolitan areas remaining above the national average. ", " Labour productivity, measured in terms of output per hour worked, increased by around 1½ per cent over the year to the June quarter. This was slightly slower than the average increase recorded during the course of the current economic expansion, and down from an increase of 2¾ per cent over the preceding year. The slower productivity growth appears to reflect a recent catch-up in employment to the unexpectedly strong output growth seen in the past couple of years. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand have been difficult to interpret for much of the past year, providing contradictory signals about near-term prospects. Newspaper-based measures of job advertisements have been declining for several months. In contrast, the level of job vacancies as reported by the ABS survey of employers has increased for the past six consecutive quarters, supported recently by large increases in the number of vacancies in Victoria (Graph 33). The declines in newspaper job advertisements may partly reflect a movement towards the use of the internet for job search. Internet-based job advertising has been growing rapidly during the past year, though its scope appears to be narrowly based, with advertisements seeking information-technology professionals still dominating internet recruitment sites. The strongest declines in newspaper advertisements have been for tradespersons; advertisements for professionals remain at a high level. ", " The difficulty firms face in finding suitable labour, as reported in both the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers and the broader NAB survey of business conditions, has eased since a few quarters ago but remains quite high <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 34)</span>. Employment intentions according to these surveys remain around their long-run average, although they are now well below the high levels seen towards the end of 1999. ", " The external accounts have continued the trend improvement of the past year, reflecting robust trading partner growth and the depreciation of the Australian dollar. The Olympics also provided a sizeable once-off boost to exports in the September quarter. The trade deficit narrowed to $1.1 billion in the September quarter, around 0.7 per cent of GDP (Graph 35). Abstracting from the estimated direct effects of the Olympics, the deficit would have been around $2.5 billion, still considerably narrower than the peak reached in the middle of 1999. Assuming the net income deficit remains stable as a share of GDP, the current account deficit in the September quarter would be around 3½ per cent of GDP, or a little over 4¼ per cent excluding the effect of the Olympics. ", " The value of exports grew by almost 30 per cent over the year to the September quarter, reflecting both higher export prices and robust volume growth. While the growth in the value of service exports was particularly strong, principally due to the boost from the Olympics, strong export growth has also occurred in all major categories <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 36)</span> and has been spread across all major destinations (Graph 37). Exports to non-Japan east Asia have grown most rapidly and have now regained the ground lost following the onset of the Asian crisis. ", " The Olympic Games is estimated to have added about $1.4 billion to service exports in the September quarter, through the sale of overseas broadcast rights and extraordinary inbound tourism, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Increased revenue from tourism has been contributing to strong growth in service export revenue for a number of months: overseas arrivals increased by 6½ per cent in the six months to August, before the surge in September, when arrivals increased by a further 17 per cent. However, the composition of the arrivals changed noticeably in September with arrivals from the US increasing sharply, and those from Asia declining significantly. ", " Rural export revenues in the quarter were boosted by strong increases in rural prices, particularly for wheat and sugar, coupled with record levels of farm production. Rural export prices rose by about 4 per cent in the quarter while volumes increased by about 5 per cent. Farm production is expected to fall slightly this year according to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, from the record level of 1999/00. The wheat crop, in particular, is estimated to be significantly lower than last year's record crop, because of drought conditions in some of the major wheat-growing areas. A locust plague, which is expected to be one of the largest on record, poses a downside risk to the outlook. ", " The value of resource exports (excluding re-exported gold) has grown by around 40 per cent over the past year, primarily reflecting additional capacity coming on stream, the strong growth in east Asia and rising non-rural commodity prices and the depreciation of the Australian dollar. In particular, higher energy prices have boosted the value of Australia's exports of oil and natural gas. Increased demand for energy is evident also in stronger exports of coal. Resource exports to non-Japan east Asia grew by nearly 40 per cent over the year to September, while exports to Japan increased by around 50 per cent. This growth reflected approximately equal increases in prices and volumes. ", " Strong trading partner growth and the depreciation of the Australian dollar have also boosted the value of exports of manufactures, which increased by around 16 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Much of the growth continues to be in exports of transport equipment, particularly to the Middle East. Exports of manufactures to east Asia have grown by just under 30 per cent over the past year. ", " The value of imports of goods and services grew only slightly in the September quarter, with about half of the growth accounted for by higher import prices. The volume of imports has only risen by around 2 per cent in the past six months, considerably slower than the pace earlier in the year. Over the year to September, imports from non-Japan east Asia have increased most rapidly and now account for nearly one-third of all imports (Table 11). ", " Consumption imports continued to grow strongly in the September quarter, despite the unwinding of pre-GST spending on some imports. Notably, growth in the value of imports of motor vehicles has eased, after stocks of motor vehicles were built up in the first half of the year. This stock build-up occurred in anticipation of stronger demand after 1 July due to tax-related falls in new car prices and the launch of a number of new models. After excluding aircraft, the growth in capital imports has maintained the pace of the first half of the year, reflecting healthy demand for electronic data processing and telecommunications equipment. The value of imports of intermediate goods was boosted by the higher prices for fuels and lubricants, which offset a large decline in imports of goods for processing, primarily gold. ", " The net income deficit widened slightly in the June quarter, though as a share of GDP, there has been a gradual improvement over the past couple of years. The increase in the deficit in the June quarter was primarily due to growth in dividends paid to foreign holders of Australian equities. Reflecting strong export growth, the ratio of net income payments to exports decreased by 1.6 percentage points over the first half of 2000 to be 13.6 per cent in the June quarter. ", " Australia's net foreign liabilities increased by $21 billion in the June quarter to $404 billion, around 64 per cent of GDP. Over a third of this increase reflected the better performance of the Australian equity market than those offshore, which boosted the value of foreigners' equity holdings in Australia relative to the value of foreign equities held by Australians. The composition of net inflows of debt and equity has shifted recently. After a few years where equity investment accounted for the bulk of capital inflows, recently debt inflows have been more prominent (Graph 38). This increase in net debt inflows reflects borrowing by the private sector as the public sector has continued to repay foreign debt. Over the year to March the outstanding stock of public sector foreign debt fell by almost $9 billion. ", " Commodity prices have increased at a fast pace over the past year, reflecting the strength of the world economy. As discussed in <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>, oil prices have risen to levels not seen since the Gulf War in 1990, and this has boosted the prices of other energy commodities. The Bank's commodity price index increased by nearly 3 per cent in SDR terms over the September quarter and by 10 per cent over the year (Graph 39). In Australian dollar terms, the increase has been much greater, with the index 7 per cent higher over the quarter and nearly 22 per cent higher over the year. ", " However, in recent weeks, the prices of some commodities, most notably base metal prices, have reversed the gains seen earlier in the year as sentiment about the global outlook has weakened. This is particularly the case for aluminium and nickel prices. ", " The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose by around 10 per cent in the September quarter and has since risen further to be around 70 per cent higher than the average price for 1999. Some of the increase in price is due to the strength of the global economy, as evidenced by the low level of inventories of many petroleum products and the global shortage of oil tankers. The increase in tensions in the Middle East has contributed to the reversal of most of the fall in price that occurred in late September when the US government announced the release of oil from its strategic reserve. The rise in oil prices has boosted the price of coal and other energy commodities. Coal prices, along with the price of iron ore, have also benefited from a rebound in world steel production, the recovery in Asian demand and tightening supplies in the Asia-Pacific region. ", " Rural commodity prices rose by 4 per cent in SDR terms over the September quarter and increased further in October. The prices of wheat and sugar have been boosted by expectations of smaller harvests, but beef prices declined a little. Despite falling slightly in recent months, wool prices are 15 per cent higher than a year earlier, supported by demand from China. ", " The upward trend in short-term market interest rates that began in mid 1999 has levelled out in the past six months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 40)</span>. After rising by about 150 points between mid 1999 and May this year, the yield on 90-day bank bills has shown little net change since, and is currently around 6.35 per cent. ", " Just as the rise in market yields over the year to mid 2000 was in anticipation of the tightening of monetary policy that has taken place over the past year, the more recent flattening in these yields reflects a view that official interest rates may be at or near the peak, at least for the time being. For the first time since mid 1999, the pattern in short-term yields, including in futures markets, is suggesting that the probability of further monetary tightening is low. ", " Markets moved to this view following the Bank's decision to keep the cash rate constant in October and it was reinforced by the publication of inflation data which were better than expected. It is also in line with developments overseas, particularly in the US, where markets in the past six months have swung from expectations of further tightening by the US Fed to pricing in some likelihood of an easing in the first half of next year. ", " Since mid year, long-term bond yields in Australia have moved around a flat trend, within a range of between 6 and 6¼ per cent (Graph 41), which is about a percentage point lower than their level at the start of the year. The flat trend in Australian yields over the past four months is in contrast to some fall in US yields. As a result, whereas there was little difference between Australian and US long-term bonds yields around mid year, Australian yields are now about 30 basis points above corresponding US yields (still low by decade average comparisons). ", " With the strong growth in the non-government bond market in Australia (the stock of non-government bonds is now larger than the stock of either Commonwealth or State government bonds), developments in this market segment have become more relevant. ", " Yields on bonds issued by highly-rated non-government borrowers (AA or better) have fallen by less in 2000 than yields on CGS (Graph 42). That is, the spread between these bonds and government bonds has widened. This mainly reflects the rise in the credit spread on the debt of Telstra, the largest corporate borrower in Australia. Credit spreads on debt of all telecoms around the world have risen in the past six months, as markets have become concerned that excessively high prices may have been paid in recent auctions of spectrum licences. Abstracting from Telstra debt, spreads on other highly-rated Australian borrowers have not changed much, although there has been some rise over the past month or so. Spreads on lower-rated debt have also risen somewhat recently, though the deterioration in spreads has been much less than in the US, where credit concerns have risen significantly in recent months. This less pronounced rise in spreads in Australia is due to the fact that, whereas in the US there are clear expectations of a slowing in economic activity, the economic outlook in Australia is more robust. The sharp downturn in the US share market would also have heightened credit concerns. ", " Less concern about a deterioration in credit quality in Australia may also explain the stronger performance of bank share prices in Australia relative to those in the US over the past year. Share prices of US banks have weakened significantly although they have recovered a bit as expectations have taken hold that the US interest rate cycle has peaked. ", " Issuance in the non-government market has remained strong over the past six months, with bonds outstanding rising by another $10½ billion, to $77.5 billion as at end October (Graph 43). The flow of new issues did slow in the June quarter as investor demand stalled temporarily in response to rising corporate bond spreads and the anticipated downgrading of Telstra's credit rating. But the September quarter saw a resurgence in issue activity to around previous record levels. This, however, was concentrated in the financial, non-resident and asset-backed sectors. Issuance by corporates has tended to slow. This is consistent with the pattern in other sources of corporate financing this financial year; both credit and IPOs have slowed over recent months (Table 12). It is too early, however, to conclude whether this reflects some underlying slowdown in the pace of financing, simply some noise in the data, or a lull due to the Olympics. ", " The major influence on intermediaries' interest rates over the past year or so has been the tightening of monetary policy. In addition, some banks increased rates on some business loans to reflect the fact that their overall wholesale funding costs had risen faster than the cash rate. Also, a range of rates was increased by a few basis points by some banks to cover costs associated with the introduction of the GST. (Financial services are <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘input-taxed’</span>, meaning that providers of financial services cannot claim a tax credit for these costs.) ", " Movements in, and the level of, selected lending rates of intermediaries are summarised in Table 13. ", " Banks matched rises in the cash rate in lifting their housing rates, with the standard variable rate now <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.05 per cent</span>, on average. This remains 70 basis points lower than at the cyclical low-point in interest rates in 1994. ", " Interest rates on most personal loans have risen by a similar amount to the cash rate over the course of this tightening cycle. Business indicator rates have, on average, increased by a little more than the cash rate, for the reasons mentioned above, though rises in the interest rate on residentially-secured term loans for small businesses, a popular product, have been broadly in line with the cash rate (Graph 44). The all-up interest cost of variable-rate loans to small businesses (i.e. indicator rates plus applicable risk margins) has increased a little less than the cash rate. It increased about 1.1 percentage points between September 1999 and June 2000, compared with a rise in the cash rate of 1.25 percentage points over that period. ", " Interest rates on fixed-rate loans for housing and small businesses have fallen from their peaks of early this year. This reflects falls in capital market interest rates which form the basis for the banks' pricing of retail fixed rates (Graph 45). ", " By international standards, the Australian share market has performed well over the past six months or so. The ASX 200 has risen by 8 per cent since end April, compared with a slight fall in broad-based share price indexes in the US over the same period (Graph 46). The Australian market reached a new high in August, and again in early November. ", " The relatively good performance of the Australian share market has been underpinned by the banking and finance sector and the resources (excluding gold) sector (Graph 47). Share prices of companies in banking and finance have risen by 19 per cent over the past six months, reflecting the sector's strong earnings record. The index of share prices of resource companies (excluding gold producers) rose by 14 per cent over the same period, due to a combination of strong earnings growth, takeover activity and higher commodity prices, including oil prices, especially when measured in Australian dollars. The industrial sector (excluding banks and insurance) has been volatile, often driven by fluctuations in the share price of News Corporation. (News Corporation accounts for about 13 per cent of total market capitalisation.) News Corporation's share price has recently fallen which, together with continuing weakness in the price of telecoms, has caused the price index for the ‘other industrials’ segment of the market to show little net change in recent months. The fall in telecom stocks in Australia is part of a global trend <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 48)</span>. ", " Share prices of technology stocks, particularly online retailers, have also fallen sharply in Australia, as they have in all countries. The earlier extreme optimism that characterised investors in these shares has been deflated in part by disappointing earnings results (Table 14). Compared with earlier highs, share prices of online retailers have, on average, fallen by around 70 per cent in both Australia and the US. These stocks now also tend to be significantly below their issue prices. ", " Credit growth remains strong, although it has moderated in recent months (Graph 49). Total credit grew at an annual rate of 12 per cent over the 6 months to September, compared with the 15 per cent growth recorded over the six months to June (Table 15).The deceleration, which is evident in both business and household activity, may reflect a response to earlier increases in interest rates, although the GST and to a lesser extent the Olympic Games are likely to have affected recent data. Both housing and business borrowing accelerated in the June quarter but subsequently slowed, probably reflecting a tendency to draw down loans and finalise payments ahead of the GST. The Olympic Games may have also served to dampen lending activity in both sectors in September. Overall, annualised 6-month growth in household and business credit is running at around 16 per cent and 9 per cent, both around 2 percentage points below growth rates in March. ", " Growth in the deposit aggregates has generally picked up since March, with growth particularly strong in the June quarter. The rates of increase in M3 and broad money have subsequently eased to be running at annual rates well below their mid-1999 peak. The continuing slower growth of money relative to credit reflects the fact that intermediaries are funding some domestic lending with international raisings. Over the 6 months to September, funds raised internationally by all financial institutions grew at an annualised rate of 37 per cent. ", " Funds under management grew by a robust 3.6 per cent in the June quarter, to be 13 per cent higher than a year earlier (Table 16). The increase in assets in June reflected strong growth in Australian equities outweighing a decline in foreign assets, and was consistent with the outperformance of the Australian equity market over the period. Domestic equities and units in trusts now account for nearly one-third of total assets of managed funds. The addition of overseas assets, which are predominantly equities, increases the ratio to 50 per cent, a <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 percentage point</span> increase since end June 1999. ", " Growth in margin lending for equities has slowed. In the September quarter, it rose by 3 per cent, whereas it had been growing at a quarterly rate of about 10 per cent at around the turn of the year. Margin lending now represents about 8 per cent of all personal loans (excluding housing). ", " In the September quarter, the main lending institutions have provided additional information about margin lending. This is summarised in Table 17. ", " Total margin debt is currently about $6¾ billion, representing slightly more than half of the limits approved by financial institutions. These loans are backed by a total share portfolio of about $13.2 billion, representing about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> of total share market capitalisation. The average leverage ratio (the ratio of loans to shares) is <span class=\"no-wrap\">51 per cent</span>, well below the maximum rate of 70 per cent that banks say they will make available for ‘blue chip’ shares. ", " Banks and brokers had about 86,000 customers with margin loans at end September, with an average loan of just over $78,000. There were just over 12,000 margin calls to customers in the September quarter. Anecdotal evidence is that the frequency of margin calls has recently increased and that, when calls are made, instead of subscribing new money, borrowers usually instruct the lending institution to sell shares. ", " The Consumer Price Index increased by 3.7 per cent in the September quarter and by 6.1 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Graph 50)</span>. Most of the rise in the quarter reflected the net effect on prices of the introduction of the GST and the removal of wholesale sales tax (WST) on 1 July. However, the size of the net tax effects cannot be determined with certainty. Standard measures of underlying inflation that are normally used to extract temporary factors were also significantly affected by the tax changes (Table 18), and hence they cannot be used as indicators of the non-tax-related component of inflation. Based on earlier estimates of the tax effects published by the Treasury and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the tax changes appear to have contributed around 2½–3 percentage points to the CPI increase in the September quarter. While estimates of the tax effects are subject to a range of uncertainty, underlying inflation net of tax effects appears to have been around 2¼ per cent over the year to the September quarter. ", " The net effect of taxes on the September quarter CPI appears to have been less than was expected, a result that is open to a number of possible interpretations. Some businesses may have delayed passing on the tax increases to consumers and instead absorbed part of the tax in their profit margins, presumably with the potential to reverse some or all of that absorption at a later date. Another possibility is that the WST removal may have flowed through to final prices more quickly than anticipated. In that case, the price reductions that had been expected to come from this source in the next couple of quarters would be correspondingly less. Still another possibility is that the initial estimates of the long-run tax effects may turn out to have been too high. Most likely, more than one of these factors is at play, and their relative importance should become clearer as future developments in consumer prices unfold. ", " The September quarter is the first quarter of data for the 14th series CPI, which introduces a new set of weights based on the 1998/99 Household Expenditure Survey and a re-organisation of expenditure components into eleven expenditure groups, compared with the previous eight. The revision of weights in the CPI basket is one factor that contributed to a smaller net tax effect than previously estimated for the September quarter, in part due to a higher weight on motor vehicles, the prices of which were reduced by the tax changes. ", " Increases in retail petrol prices, of around 10 per cent, also contributed significantly to CPI inflation in the September quarter. Over the year to the September quarter, retail petrol prices have increased by 24 per cent, contributing 1 percentage point to inflation. The increases continue to reflect a combination of a higher world price for crude oil and further depreciation of the exchange rate. ", " Apart from rising petrol prices, the major contributions to the CPI increase in the September quarter were from prices of items that became subject to GST but whose costs were not previously heavily affected by the WST, for example house purchase, tobacco, domestic holiday travel and accommodation, meals out and take-away foods, and telecommunication. Partly offsetting these increases were price falls mainly for items that were formerly taxed at relatively high rates under the WST regime, for example motor vehicles and audio, visual and computing equipment. Prices of the latter items appear to have fallen more during the past year than could be explained by the removal of WST. Some government subsidies, which were introduced as part of the tax package on 1 July, also had an influence on prices in the September quarter CPI. The First Home Owners' Scheme, which provides a grant of $7,000 to first home buyers, had a small negative effect on the recorded rise in house purchase prices in the quarter, and is likely to have subtracted around 0.1 percentage point from the CPI. The new Child Care Benefit Scheme, which replaces two previous assistance schemes, led to a 15 per cent fall in the effective price of child care, and also subtracted close to 0.1 percentage point from the CPI in the quarter. ", " In import-weighted terms, the Australian dollar has depreciated by around 14 per cent since the beginning of the year (Graph 51). Over the course of the year, the exchange rate depreciation has contributed to the increase in the Australian-dollar price of crude oil, with the pass-through to the retail petrol price, and therefore CPI inflation, occurring quite rapidly. Apart from the effect via oil prices, the exchange rate depreciation has also been evident more broadly in import prices at the docks and in the prices of manufacturing inputs, with some of that effect likely to have flowed through to prices of final manufactured goods. ", " The effect of the depreciation on the prices of items in the CPI other than petrol is more difficult to establish, partly due to the dominant influence of tax effects on the September quarter CPI, and partly due to the more protracted pass-through of exchange rate movements to retail prices in recent years. Nonetheless, a smaller than expected fall in the retail price of imported motor vehicles (of 1.3 per cent in the quarter) may be partly attributable to the depreciation of the exchange rate in recent quarters. Moreover, the further depreciation over the past two months is yet to appear in the consumer prices data. While firms might be expected to offset some of the depreciation with temporarily reduced margins and the use of exchange-rate hedges, their scope to absorb the price impact of a sustained depreciation may be limited, particularly if margins have already been squeezed by absorption of some of the tax effects and by the effects of earlier exchange rate depreciation which was not fully passed on. ", " Aggregate indices of producer prices by stage of production have recorded strong increases during the past year, particularly at the preliminary and intermediate stages of production (Table 19). With the exception of construction prices, where input costs had been affected by the WST, producer price indices are not affected by the recent tax changes. The increases over the past year have in part reflected rapidly rising prices of commodities such as petroleum and basic metal products, as well as more broadly based increases in other raw materials costs. Final producer prices, excluding export prices, increased only moderately in the September quarter but are still significantly higher over the year. Around a third of the increase in final prices over the past year reflects the rise in petroleum and chemical product prices; excluding this item, final prices increased by 3.2 per cent. ", " Part of the disparity between the price increases at earlier and later stages of production reflects the greater importance of raw commodities as a share of costs at the earlier stages of production. As inputs from earlier stages of production represent only a portion of the cost of producing final goods, final prices would not need to rise by as great a percentage as the increase in input costs for profit margins to be maintained. Even allowing for that, however, there may have been some absorption of rising input costs recently, which could imply further upward pressure on final prices if the higher input costs are sustained. ", " Industry-specific price indices point to relatively strong increases during the past year in manufacturing (in both input and output prices) and in some service industries. In the construction industry, materials prices fell in the September quarter following the removal of the WST. Excluding this effect, the prices of construction materials for both housing and other building increased in the quarter, but at a slower pace than had been evident during the previous year, consistent with recent indications of a decline in demand pressures in the building industry. ", " The wage cost index (WCI) and average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) measures continue to provide differing pictures of recent wage developments (Graph 52, Table 20). The WCI increased by 2.8 per cent over the year to the June quarter 2000, unchanged from the year-ended rate recorded in the March quarter. In contrast, preliminary estimates suggest that AWOTE increased by 5.9 per cent over the year to August, a sharp pick-up from the growth rate of 2.1 per cent recorded a year earlier. The differences between these two measures reflect their differing sources and methods of construction as well as an important conceptual difference, with the WCI being a measure of the change in wage <em>rates</em>, while AWOTE is a measure of the change in the wage <em>bill</em>. Some implications of these differences are discussed in <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>. ", " The volatile nature of the AWOTE data makes it difficult to assess the extent to which these data may indicate an increase in underlying wage pressures at present. The series is susceptible to compositional change in the employment survey underlying the estimates, and the recent strong increase could at least partly represent a reversal of any such effects that may have contributed to the unusually low growth recorded a year ago. That interpretation would be consistent with the overall picture presented by other wage indicators, which do not record either the sharp dip or subsequent pick-up in wage pressures. On the other hand, in an environment of declining unemployment, strong growth and, more recently, rising inflation, it is possible that the survey is signalling some genuine pick-up in wages growth, even if its extent is overstated. A clearer interpretation of these trends should be possible once the other major measures of wages for the September quarter become available. ", " At this stage, data for new enterprise agreements appear broadly consistent with the wages picture given by the WCI up to the June quarter. The average annualised wage increase yielded by enterprise agreements certified in the June quarter was 3.4 per cent, unchanged from the previous two quarters and noticeably below the figures being recorded two to three years ago. There are some signs, however, that these may have begun to pick up, with a number of more recent agreements yielding somewhat higher increases than were observed earlier in the year. ", " Recent business surveys also point to some modest upward pressure on wages growth in the context of a tightening labour market. The NAB survey of non-farm businesses indicates that growth in actual and expected labour costs has continued to pick up, albeit slowly. The September quarter ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers indicates that the net balance of firms finding it more difficult to obtain labour remains close to cyclical peak levels. Both surveys suggest that where firms are due to complete a new enterprise agreement, these are expected on average to provide for higher wage increases than the agreements they replace. ", " In some instances, wage increases from enterprise agreements could be subject to modification in light of the effect of the recent tax changes on the CPI. Some agreements contain clauses that provide for a full or partial indexing of wages to the CPI, while others provide for wage increases to be reviewed in the event that the effects of the GST on inflation exceed expectations or exceed some defined benchmark. In these latter cases, agreements vary as to how the benchmark is defined and the period over which the tax effect is to be assessed, and the provisions are in many cases open to interpretation by the parties to the agreement. Hence the overall impact of such renegotiation clauses remains uncertain. Nonetheless, the proportion of agreements that contain a GST-related clause has remained quite low, and the lower-than-expected outcome for the CPI in the September quarter appears at this stage to have reduced the likelihood of significant additional wage increases being generated by this mechanism. ", " The Mercer Cullen Egan Dell salary review indicates that growth in executive pay has been relatively stable for some time now. The September quarter survey indicates that the base salary of executives has been growing at around 4½ per cent over the past year. The base salary component does not incorporate any bonuses or returns from participation in corporate share schemes. ", " The Australian Council of Trade Unions announced in early November that it intends to make an application to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to vary award rates of pay. The claim, to be heard as part of the Safety Net Review early next year, will seek a $28 per week increase in pay for all weekly award rates from the federal minimum wage ($400.40 per week) up to $492.20, and a 5.7 per cent increase for award rates above this level. ", " Consumers' expectations of inflation have declined considerably in recent months after the sharp increases seen in the period leading up to the implementation of the GST (Graph 53). According to the Melbourne Institute survey, the median inflation expectation in October was 4.5 per cent, about the same as had been recorded in the previous couple of months but well down from the peak of over 8 per cent in June. The survey also suggests a tighter concentration of responses in the 2–3 per cent range, with a declining number of consumers expecting inflation of 10 per cent or more. The results thus seem consistent with consumers increasingly expecting the effect of the tax changes to be of a one-off nature rather than representing a general rise in ongoing inflation. The recent declines bring consumers' inflation expectations back to around the levels prevailing in early 1999. ", " The latest business surveys indicate that price increases following the introduction of the GST were lower than expected, although there was a pick-up from earlier quarterly rates. The outlook reported by businesses for the coming quarter is for a smaller increase in prices than occurred in the September quarter, but one that is still relatively high. Abstracting from the September quarter, both the broad NAB survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers suggest that there has been some upward trend in ongoing inflation in recent quarters. In part, this is likely to have reflected the effects of higher oil prices and the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar. ", " The inflation forecasts of financial-market economists changed only slightly in the latest survey conducted by the Bank following the release of the September quarter CPI (Table 21). The median forecast for the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">June 2001</span> declined to 5.4 per cent; excluding tax effects, the forecast was unchanged at 2.8 per cent, which implies that the downward revision comes from lower estimates of the effect of the tax changes on the CPI over this period. The median inflation forecast for the year to June 2002 increased slightly to 2.4 per cent. The majority of respondents do not expect the tax changes to affect inflation over the year to June 2002. It is likely that respondents' inflation forecasts incorporate assumptions of some reversal of recent exchange rate and oil price movements. ", " Trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT) following the release of the September quarter CPI, continue to revise up their forecasts for inflation for the year to June 2001. Somewhat surprisingly, union officials expect inflation to remain high in the following year, despite the tax effects dropping out of the annual inflation rate. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of financial market participants, measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, have remained relatively stable since April, at between 2¾ and 3 per cent, after reaching a peak of 3¾ per cent in mid January. ", " The tax effects which caused the headline measure of inflation to increase sharply in the September quarter will keep the headline inflation rate high in year-ended terms until they drop out of the calculation in the September quarter 2001. As discussed above, there are considerable uncertainties in estimating the net contribution of the tax changes to the quarterly and annual inflation figures, and hence it is more difficult than usual to extract a measure of the underlying trend. At this stage inflation excluding tax effects, and also excluding the effects of oil and other temporary factors, appears to have been around 2¼ per cent over the latest year. ", " On this basis, inflation remains noticeably higher than it was a year ago, even if the upward trajectory does not appear to have continued into the September quarter. The overall increase in inflation over the past year has had some industry-specific elements, notably in relation to house prices and petrol prices, but looks to have been driven more broadly by the continued strength of the domestic economy. With GDP having grown at an annual rate of 4¾ per cent during the past three years, and levels of capacity utilisation increasing, demand conditions have clearly been placing greater upward pressure on prices than was the case a couple of years ago. ", " At this stage, the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar does not seem to have had a noticeable impact on consumer prices apart from petrol, but, if the exchange rate remains around current levels, it will clearly represent a source of upward pressure on prices in the next one to two years. In import-weighted terms, the exchange rate has depreciated by a further 6 per cent in the past two months, to be 14 per cent lower than it was at the beginning of the year. While importers may to some extent be able to hedge against currency movements and temporarily absorb exchange rate changes within their profit margins, their scope to do so may be quite limited given that margins may already have been squeezed by absorption of some tax effects and higher input costs. ", " Another important near-term factor for inflation will be developments in international oil prices. Higher crude oil prices, with the lower exchange rate, have resulted in a large increase in domestic petrol prices. As in other countries, this has added about 1 percentage point to the CPI increase over the latest year, and has added significantly to business input costs. In assessing underlying inflation prospects, the Bank seeks to abstract from the initial impact of oil prices in much the same way as is done for tax effects, but to be alert for signs that higher fuel costs are feeding into inflation on a more sustained basis through indirect channels. Oil prices are unlikely to contribute to headline inflation in the year ahead to the same extent that they have in the recent past, and indeed the Bank's forecasts assume that there will be some decline in international oil prices in the period ahead. Were oil prices to remain at current high levels, that would probably imply some upward pressure on underlying inflation in the near term as the indirect effects of higher fuel costs flow through to the general price level. ", " Longer-term prospects for inflation will depend importantly on developments in labour costs. Wage indicators have provided mixed signals recently, with the wage cost index and data on new enterprise agreements indicating that wages growth remained moderate up to mid 2000, while more timely data on ordinary-time earnings point to a sharp pick-up in wages growth over the year to August. These latter figures are often subject to spurious volatility and should therefore not be relied upon too heavily, but some pick-up in wages growth would appear consistent with the continued tightening in labour market conditions seen over the past year and more recent signs of somewhat higher settlements being reached in enterprise agreements. Recent business surveys also suggest modest upward pressure on wages growth at present. ", " While the September quarter CPI result was a little weaker than expected, the combined effects of several years of strong growth, a tightening labour market, high oil prices and a low exchange rate could still be expected to generate further upward pressure on inflation over the next year or two. There does, however, appear to have been some change in the mix of these forces over recent months. On balance, the risks to inflation arising from domestic demand pressures may have eased slightly, while the further depreciation of the Australian dollar has added to inflationary pressures. ", " A forecast made on the standard technical assumption that the exchange rate stays at or near recent levels, would have inflation in underlying terms, net of tax effects, gradually increasing further, to be around 3 per cent by the end of 2001, and likely to remain at that rate for some time thereafter. Until the June quarter 2001, CPI inflation measured on a four-quarter-ended basis can be expected to remain high – probably over 5 per cent – because of the effects of tax reform. Subsequently, with these effects dropping out, and assuming a reduction in international oil prices (and hence domestic fuel costs), CPI inflation would be somewhat lower than underlying inflation after June 2001, although tending to drift back up towards it as those temporary factors waned. These projections assume that there is no response of wages or price expectations to the temporarily higher headline rates of inflation now being observed. ", " The forecast is subject to a number of sources of uncertainty. On the upside, the assumption that wage and price expectations will be unaffected by the current high rates of CPI inflation may still prove to be unfounded, although that risk appears to have diminished recently. This source of upside risk to the forecast would, however, be amplified if oil prices were to remain high or if they were to increase further, instead of gradually declining as assumed. The forecast is also sensitive to the assumption about the exchange rate, and any further currency depreciation would similarly add to upside risks to inflation. On the other hand, with the currency already at historically low levels, there is clearly potential for it to appreciate in the forecast period. Were that to occur, it would imply a more benign inflation outlook than would be generated from an exchange rate close to its current level.

", " Oil prices have risen to their highest level for about ten years in recent months (Graph A1). At over US$30 per barrel, oil costs about three times as much as it did at its low point in late 1998. That twenty-year low in oil prices was a result of a combination of an increase in the supply of oil from OPEC in early 1997, and a fall in demand for oil shortly thereafter as a result of the Asian crisis. An increase in demand as the world economy has recovered, and decisions by OPEC to reduce supply, helped to push prices higher during 1999. During 2000, ongoing growth in demand, concerns about the low levels of world oil inventories and limited global refining capacity have seen the price of oil continue to rise. In response to the rise, OPEC has increased its production quotas four times this year. At present, however, oil prices remain high and are over 60 per cent higher than their average for the past three years. ", " This rise, while very substantial, is not of the same order of magnitude as those seen in the oil price ‘shocks’ of the mid and late 1970s. Nonetheless, if oil prices remain high, they can be expected to put upward pressure on global inflation rates and to have some dampening influence on global economic growth. The pressure on prices results from the direct impact on price indexes of the higher prices for household expenditure on petrol, and from the indirect impact on prices for a range of goods and services which embody transportation costs. The direct effect has added about 1 percentage point or so to CPI inflation over the past year in most countries, with further effects likely in the short term. The indirect impact may take somewhat longer to come through. It might be mitigated to some extent by a short-term compression of profit margins, or partly offset by other cost savings. ", " The effects on economic activity arise firstly because the rise in oil prices pushes up the cost of production. As such, it represents a reduction in the aggregate supply of goods and services that can be sustained at any given price level in the industrialised economies. Absent an offsetting demand expansion, this means that production will be lower, and prices higher, than otherwise. Moreover, since the rise in oil prices represents a loss of income to oil consumers, it is likely that aggregate demand in energy-consuming countries will be weaker than otherwise. This income is transferred to oil producers, who are then likely to expand their own demand for goods and services, providing some offsetting impetus to the contraction in oil-consuming regions. The net result of all these forces is that world economic growth is likely to be lower, and inflation higher, than would otherwise have been the case. ", " The recent rise in oil prices is smaller, in proportionate terms, than those which occurred in the mid and late 1970s episodes. For this reason, the impact on global growth and inflation should be considerably smaller than on those occasions, unless the price of oil were to rise much further. In addition, most advanced economies have become relatively more efficient in their use of oil, largely as a response to the earlier rises in oil prices. Graph A2 shows how the quantity of oil consumed per unit of real GDP has declined over time, so that although the price of oil remains much higher than it was prior to the OPEC 1 increase, the share of total income devoted to spending on oil has returned to pre-OPEC 1 levels (Graph A3). ", " The effects on individual economies and regions can be expected to vary, depending on the pattern of their production and the extent to which they rely on imported, as opposed to domestically produced oil. It is important to note that a number of developing economies have probably <em>increased</em> their reliance on oil as a result of rapid industrialisation over the past two decades. ", " In Australia's case, the effects of rising oil prices are likely to be less contractionary than for most other advanced countries. While Australia has in recent years been a small net importer of oil, it is a substantial net exporter of natural gas (Table A1), the price of which is linked to the price of oil. Hence there is a net transfer of income towards Australian producers from world consumers. All other things equal, this would tend to impart a stimulus to the Australian economy, though the transfer within Australia from energy consumers to producers might be a dampening influence in the short term. Should the price of oil remain high for some time, it is also possible that prices for other energy sources such as coal could increase, as has tended to occur in the past.

In Australia there are several different measures that attempt to summarise economy-wide developments in wages or labour costs.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnc1\" id=\"rc1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Of these, four are commonly cited: ", " The behaviour of these four measures during the past decade is shown in Graph C1. ", " The first three indicators listed above are measures of the labour cost or wage <em>bill</em> per employee. At times, there can be significant divergences among them, arising partly from differences in coverage and sources; for example, the national accounts measure can differ from the other two because it is derived from a different survey, and because it includes non-wage costs. ", " All of the wage-bill measures are subject to variability induced by compositional change, arising because fluctuations in the relative representation of low- and high-wage employees in a survey will affect the recorded level of average wages. In the case of the AWE measure, a particularly important issue is the impact of changes in the relative shares of full-time and part-time workers – an increase in the proportion of part-time workers will reduce AWE because part-time workers earn less per week than the average. In addition to generating short-run volatility, this effect is likely to result in a longer-run understatement of wages growth by the AWE measure, due to a trend increase in the share of part-time workers in total employment. The ordinary-time earnings measure, which is based only on full-time workers, is not affected by this form of compositional change, and in this respect is conceptually closer to an hourly wage measure. Its growth is likely, however, to have been boosted on average by a tendency for ordinary-time working hours to increase, and it remains subject to the more general problems of volatility affecting all wage-bill measures. ", " The WCI differs from the other three indicators in that it is a measure of wage <em>rates</em> rather than the wage bill. It attempts to measure changes in the cost of purchasing a fixed quantity and quality of labour input. The characteristics of each selected job in the WCI are specified in detail and jobs with the same description are matched over time, allowing the index to be constructed from the change in hourly wage rate for each job. As a result of these features, the WCI might be expected to generate a lower average growth rate in the long run than would be recorded by an hourly wage-bill measure. This difference would arise if there was a tendency over time for lower-skill jobs to be replaced by higher-skill jobs, which typically attract higher earnings. ", " Without a longer run of historical data, it is difficult to say how large such a difference might be. The experience of New Zealand suggests that the average difference between wage-bill and wage-rate indicators could be quite significant. Statistics New Zealand publishes a labour cost index (LCI), which is similar in concept to the WCI, and an average hourly earnings (or wage bill) measure. The difference between the two series has averaged close to 1 percentage point per annum since the <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 1990s</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph C2)</span>. On the other hand, in the United States, which also publishes an employment cost index (ECI) similar to Australia's WCI, there appears to be little systematic difference between that measure of wages growth and an hourly earnings measure. ", " In order to assess developments in inflation, wages need to be compared with productivity to derive a measure of unit labour costs. In practice, none of the indicators discussed above is likely to be ideal for this purpose. Wage-bill measures, such as those derived from the AWE survey or national accounts data, are conceptually the most appropriate, since unit labour costs can be thought of as representing the overall wage bill per unit of output. However, these measures, as noted above, can be subject to significant short-run volatility driven by fluctuations in the composition of employment between surveys. This can make short-run developments in the series difficult to interpret. ", " The WCI, being a wage-rate measure for a fixed basket of jobs, is not fully compatible with economy-wide productivity measures for the purposes of deriving unit labour costs. For the reasons discussed above, the WCI appears likely to grow less rapidly on average than measures derived from the wage bill, and hence a unit labour cost series constructed by combining the WCI with economy-wide productivity would tend to understate the inflation trend. The extent of this effect is difficult to assess, given the short history of the series. At the same time, since the WCI is less affected by short-run compositional change, it can be expected to be less volatile than wage-bill measures in the short run. This implies that the WCI may give more reliable signals of changes in the trend in wage rates, although, given its relatively short history, its behaviour has not yet been tested over an economic cycle.

The United States in particular is now in a period of considerably slower growth, and this has prompted a broader reassessment of international economic prospects, with most observers in recent months revising downward their expectations for global growth. This shift in expectations has been reinforced by renewed concerns about the durability of economic recovery in Japan. ", " The slowing now under way in the US economy comes after a period of exceptional strength, both in terms of the length of the economic expansion to date and the average pace of growth recorded in the past few years, with growth being particularly strong in the first half of 2000. Some easing in the earlier pace of growth was widely seen to be desirable to forestall a further rise in inflation, and monetary policy in the US had been tightened in late 1999 and 2000 with that goal in mind. The majority of forecasters had repeatedly anticipated a slowing during the past several years, but it took much longer to occur than most had expected. The slowing did finally begin during the second half of 2000, and in contrast to the experience in earlier years, most observers have recently found the data on the US economy to be weaker than they had expected. ", " Financial market developments have played an increasingly important role in shaping US economic performance in recent years, both adding impetus to growth through much of the second half of the 1990s and more recently dampening demand. Broad share-market indices in the US peaked in early 2000 and have since declined by around 15 per cent, while ‘technology’ stocks have declined much more sharply. Falling share prices appear to have made households in the US more reluctant to increase their spending, as well as discouraging equity-raising by businesses. At the same time, credit market conditions have tightened, making it more difficult for US firms to obtain funds for investment from that source. ", " There is at present, therefore, a good deal of uncertainty about the near-term prospects for the US economy. The various contractionary forces could combine in a way which continues to push US growth down very markedly. Alternatively, after a temporary weak period growth could firm later in the year. The recent interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve will increase the likelihood of the latter outcome, but it is too soon at present to discount altogether the possibility of the former. ", " The Australian economy has also slowed in recent months, although for somewhat different reasons than the US. GDP growth in the September quarter (the latest period for which the accounts are available) was weaker than it had been in June, both on a quarterly and year-ended basis, although growth was still over 4 per cent over the year. More recent indicators, however, point to only a moderate pace of growth in the latter part of the year and into the early part of 2001, with domestic demand running much more slowly than it had done in the preceding year, and the labour market turning in a noticeably softer performance. Strong growth in exports has continued to provide a partial offset to the weakness in domestic demand. Exports have continued to benefit from the low Australian dollar and, despite the easing in trading partner growth towards the end of the year, the value of exports in the December quarter was 27 per cent higher than a year earlier. This trend has also led to a substantial narrowing of Australia's current account deficit. ", " A number of factors of a temporary nature have affected the recent pattern in domestic demand in Australia. The introduction of the new tax system created a strong incentive for households to shift expenditures from the second half into the first half of 2000. This was most strikingly evident in the case of housing investment, which contributed strongly to growth in the first half of the year, pushing spending on housing construction to an all-time high as a share of GDP. This was followed, in the September quarter, by the largest quarterly decline in housing activity in the period for which records are available, which reduced GDP in the September quarter by more than a percentage point. The introduction of the GST also shifted some retail spending into the first <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of the year</span>, although the impact was much smaller in magnitude than was the case for housing. There are some reports by industry groups of other transitional issues associated with changes in the tax system. ", " The factors above should largely be confined to affecting the timing of spending, but even apart from these effects, the underlying trend in domestic demand has moderated. Several forces have been at work in bringing this about. Higher oil prices have reduced consumer purchasing power, although these have been partly reversed. The strong gains in household wealth in recent years, which supported consumption growth, have lessened considerably, since house prices are no longer rising and share market gains have been more subdued. In addition, interest rates have increased, which will have reduced funds available for household spending of a discretionary nature. ", " As is detailed in the body of the <em>Statement</em>, however, financial conditions in Australia do not appear to be as restrictive as they are in the US. The rise in interest rates in Australia brought them to levels well below their <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1990s</span> peak; in the US they exceeded it. Credit growth – while slowing a little – remains quite strong, and there is no evidence of a significant decline in credit availability in capital markets. The US experience is quite different. Although share markets in Australia have to some extent taken their lead from the US, the run-up in Australian share prices in the late 1990s was never as large, and the softer performance over the past year or so has been much less pronounced. Indeed, share prices in Australia have increased slightly over the past year while those in the US have been declining. The Australian dollar exchange rate, while higher than it was in late 2000, remains at historically low levels, and therefore supportive of activity, in contrast to the strong US dollar. ", " There is also an absence of the sorts of imbalances that have curtailed growth in previous business cycles. Wages growth, for example, has remained moderate, and there are no signs of over-investment leading to excess capacity. Business profitability in most parts of the economy is high, and government financial accounts suggest that fiscal policy is contributing to growth in the current fiscal year. Against this background the Australian economy still appears well placed to grow, notwithstanding a somewhat weaker near-term outlook. Of course, much will depend on international developments, as Australia would be unlikely to be unaffected in the event of a more pronounced slowdown encompassing the US as well as other major trading partners. ", " Inflation in Australia remains well contained. The December quarter CPI recorded an increase of 5.8 per cent over the latest year, a figure which incorporates a significant contribution from the tax changes introduced in mid year and the effects of higher petrol prices. Excluding the first-round effects of those factors, the Bank's best estimate of core inflation over the year is around 2 per cent. This estimate is subject to some uncertainty, however, because the size of the tax effect is not known with precision. ", " This result is lower than had generally been expected. Higher import prices stemming from the lower Australian dollar have for some time been expected to begin flowing through to the consumer, as have the indirect effects of higher fuel prices, which have added substantially to production costs over the past year. While these effects have been clearly evident in producers' prices and costs, there are few signs, other than the direct increase in retail petrol prices, of these upstream price increases being passed on to the consumer. The lower than expected inflation outcome is open to a range of possible interpretations. Ongoing competitive pressures, in combination with the softening in domestic demand in the latter part of 2000, may have made it more difficult for businesses to raise their prices and resulted in a compression of profit margins in some areas. There is some evidence that this has been the case in the retailing industry, although economy-wide measures of profitability have been at unusually high levels. On the other hand, it may simply be the case that the normal lags between movements in import prices and their pass-through to final consumers have been lengthening, and that these effects will still become evident in due course. It is also possible that the tax effects on consumer prices have been smaller than estimated, which would imply a correspondingly higher estimate of the ongoing component of inflation. ", " The Bank's forecast allows for some effects of the earlier fall in the exchange rate and higher production costs to take their course. However, the experience of a number of years now is that these pressures tend to be more muted than was the case historically. With growth having moderated, moreover, it is likely that domestic cost pressures will be contained. It remains the case that there are relatively few wage rises in response to the GST, and measures of inflation expectations have fallen, while the exchange rate has risen somewhat. Hence there are, in the Bank's view, considerably better prospects than there were three months ago that inflation will be comfortably within the 2–3 per cent target zone over the coming one to two years. ", " In summary, the risks of exceeding the inflation target have diminished since the last <em>Statement</em> in November. At the same time, economic activity is growing less quickly. While some of the most important factors at work in slowing domestic demand should prove to be temporary, business confidence has fallen, the labour market has softened and there is a heightened risk of a weakening in external demand. At its February meeting, the Board concluded that the balance of risks had shifted sufficiently that an easing of monetary policy was appropriate, and hence cash rates were reduced by 50 basis points, to 5.75 per cent. As with previous policy decisions, the move was intended to promote sustainable growth of the economy consistent with the inflation target. ", " The world economy grew strongly in 2000, with good outcomes being recorded across most major regions. Towards the end of the year, however, indications that the growth cycle had peaked became increasingly apparent. The world economy has, for some time, been expected to slow during 2001, but the extent of the expected slowing is now somewhat greater than had appeared likely a few months ago. The IMF recently revised down its assessment of growth prospects in 2001 by ½ a percentage point to around 3¾ per cent, largely due to a more pessimistic outlook for the United States (Graph 1). ", " Although these forecasts still imply that global growth in 2001 will be quite good, at around the average level recorded over the past 30 years, downside risks to the outlook appear to predominate. Many commentators in the US, for example, are concerned that the slowdown could be sharper and more protracted than currently envisaged, and the continuing softening in equity markets reinforces this concern. Globally, there are concerns about the likely flow-on effects of the slowdown in US growth, through both real and financial channels. ", " Despite strong growth through 1999 and the first half of 2000, inflation remains low. During the last year, higher oil prices have increased headline consumer price inflation across many economies, but lower oil prices in recent months have started to unwind this effect. Core inflation rates have picked up a little from the rates recorded in 1999, but remain very low, and there is little evidence of any widespread second-round effects from the earlier increase in oil prices. ", " The much anticipated slowing in the US economy commenced in the second half of 2000. The slowing appears to be sharper than was expected, with most private sector forecasters revising down their outlook for 2001 over the past three months. In response to the weaker outlook for activity, lower consumer and business confidence and tight conditions in some segments of the financial markets, the Federal Reserve Board lowered its target for the federal funds rate by a total of 1 percentage point to 5.5 per cent in January. ", " Indications of the slowdown, which saw growth in GDP slow to an annualised rate of less than 2 per cent, accumulated during the second half of last year (Graph 2). Initially these were concentrated in the housing sector, but over the last few months of the year, signs of significant slowing across the manufacturing and retail sectors became evident and employment growth weakened. Exports grew relatively strongly over the past year, despite the high level of the exchange rate, although they fell a little in the December quarter. ", " The decline in growth in the latter part of 2000 was, in part, driven by a reduction in the growth of consumer spending from the rapid pace that was recorded earlier in the year. Consumer spending increased at an annual rate of a little over 3½ per cent in the second half of 2000, following growth of around 5½ per cent over the previous year. Weaker employment growth, and the fall in household wealth, associated with declining share prices, may have contributed both to the softening in consumer spending and to the sharp deterioration in consumer sentiment that took place (Graph 3). The overall level of household wealth, however, remains high. ", " Business conditions also weakened during the last few months of 2000. In the manufacturing sector, there was a widespread fall in production across the traditional categories, particularly in motor vehicle production, and growth in information technology and communications (ITC)-related production eased a little. Total business investment fell in the December quarter, driven by a large fall in transport equipment, and a weakening in growth in ITC equipment spending. Non-residential construction spending, in contrast, remained relatively robust. The weakening in investment spending overall is not surprising, given the historically high rates of investment in recent years. Total business investment spending as a share of GDP remains around the peak level recorded in the early 1980s, and well above any level recorded since. The National Association of Purchasing Management survey implies a weak period for traditional manufacturers and non-manufacturing firms. The outlook for the ITC sector has also weakened in recent periods, although ITC equipment orders remain at high levels. Financial conditions facing businesses appear to have continued to tighten. According to the Federal Reserve Survey of senior loan officers, concerns about the credit quality of some borrowers have resulted in tighter credit conditions being imposed on bank loans. Spreads at the lower-quality end of the bond market have widened since mid 2000, although they have narrowed somewhat since early January. ", " Overall, the slowdown in activity in the latter part of 2000 translated into slower employment growth. In the four months to January employment growth averaged 100,000 per month – compared with the average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">150,000 per month</span> that was recorded in the previous six months (adjusted for the impact of census workers). The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2 per cent in January. ", " After peaking in the middle of 2000, consumer price inflation declined modestly to 3.4 per cent over the year to December, primarily reflecting recent declines in oil prices after their earlier strong increases. Core measures of inflation remained at an annual rate of around 2½ per cent in the second half of 2000. The outlook for core prices continues to be subdued with growth in employment costs easing in the December quarter, slower activity likely to ease inflationary pressures in the non-traded sector and the current level of the exchange rate containing import prices. ", " The Japanese economy slowed during 2000, after having grown strongly at the beginning of the year (Graph 4). Revisions to the national accounts suggest that growth in the middle of 2000 was considerably lower than previously reported, with output declining in the September quarter, driven by a large fall in public investment. Slower export growth, combined with continued weakness in consumer spending, also contributed to the weaker outcome. Other indicators of activity also pointed to a moderation in growth during the second half of 2000. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's overall business activity index was broadly flat over the six months to November, after having increased by around 3 per cent over the previous year, and the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey implied that prospects for businesses deteriorated a little in the December quarter, although they remain well above their level of a year earlier. ", " During the past couple of years, the main drivers of growth in Japan have been business investment spending and exports. The recovery in investment spending, evident since mid 1999, reflected an improvement in corporate profitability, particularly in the information technology sector, and was supported by external demand and concerted efforts towards consolidating operating costs at the firm level. The recovery in exports reflected strong demand in the rest of east Asia and the US. During the second half of 2000, however, external demand slowed and growth in machinery orders weakened, particularly for ITC equipment. The longer-term outlook for business investment thus appears to have deteriorated, although the lower level of the yen should provide some support to exporters in the period ahead. ", " The outlook for consumption remains uncertain. Little growth was recorded in consumer spending in the June and September quarters last year, following the large increase recorded in the March quarter, with weak growth in household incomes continuing to constrain consumer spending. Consumer sentiment, however, continued to improve through the second half of 2000, supported by growth of employment of nearly 1½ per cent over the period. Consumer sentiment is now a little above its long-run average level, and should provide support for consumer spending in the period ahead. Consumer prices have continued to fall on a year-ended basis, to be down by 0.2 per cent over the year to December. ", " The strong growth experienced in non-Japan Asia through the first half of 2000 continued into the second half of the year, with GDP expanding at an annualised rate of around 7 per cent in the September quarter (Graph 5).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Significant divergences in economic performance across the region have continued, however, with outcomes in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines remaining considerably weaker than the average. The strength in some of the economies in the region in 2000 surprised most commentators who had expected an easing in the rapid pace experienced since the recovery from crisis commenced. There are, however, signs that some slowing is beginning to occur, with external demand moderating and higher oil prices curtailing expenditure. ", " Exports continued to be one of the main contributors to growth during 2000, driven largely by the strength in world electronics demand, particularly in the US. The strength in electronics demand led, in turn, to a strong pick-up in investment spending on equipment, while construction investment remained weak. Consumer spending, in contrast, slowed during 2000 after having grown strongly over the past two years. This may reflect, in part, the fall in share markets across the region and related falls in consumer confidence, as well as the effect of higher oil prices. ", " More recently, there have been signs that industrial production and exports in the region are slowing, particularly in Korea and Taiwan (Graph 6). In Korea, industrial production in December was over 8 per cent below its peak in August and the value of exports was down 10 per cent in the December quarter. In Taiwan, industrial production has clearly weakened since the middle of 2000, to fall below its level of a year ago, and exports fell in the December quarter. Looking ahead, exports from the region as a whole could be adversely affected by any slowdown in US demand for ITC products. ", " Inflation edged up in the region in the latter half of 2000, largely due to higher oil prices. However, inflation generally remains low, at rates around or below those prevailing prior to the 1997 crisis, in all of these countries except Indonesia. ", " The national accounts recorded a modest pick-up in GDP in New Zealand in the September quarter 2000, following the decline in the June quarter. Much of the slowing in June reflected weaker domestic demand, particularly housing and consumer spending. Business investment, in contrast, remained quite strong through the period. The external sector benefited from the competitive exchange rate and strong trading partner growth over much of 2000, with very strong growth in prices received by exporters and solid growth in export volumes in the first half of the year. Consumer prices rose sharply for the second consecutive quarter in December, taking headline inflation to 4 per cent, well above the RBNZ's 0–3 per cent target band. Much of the increase in the CPI in recent quarters, however, reflected the impact of higher oil prices and increased cigarette taxes. Excluding these factors, inflation is running at around 2.5 per cent. ", " The euro area expanded at a solid pace for the fifth consecutive quarter in September, albeit at a slower rate than was recorded earlier in 2000. Despite steady employment and wages growth, weak consumer spending was the main reason for the slowing. In part, this may have reflected the effect of higher petrol prices and interest charges on household cashflows. Business investment, in contrast, remained firm, underpinned by rising capacity utilisation as a result of the recent solid growth in industrial production and exports. While there are signs that growth in the euro area may have softened, the overall outlook remains favourable. Consumer sentiment continues to hold up at very high levels, and monetary conditions and the stance of fiscal policy are also supportive of continued steady growth. Business sentiment, however, has weakened since mid 2000, particularly in Germany. ", " Output in the UK increased by a modest 0.3 per cent in the December quarter, to be 2.4 per cent higher over the year. Indications are that the housing sector has softened and business conditions remain weak, as growth in industrial production and exports have been adversely affected by the strength of the exchange rate. Consumption growth has been robust, reflecting firm labour market outcomes, although there are signs that the labour market is softening, with employment flat in the September quarter and growth in job vacancies slowing in recent months. ", " As evidence has emerged over the past couple of months that the US economy has slowed more quickly than previously expected, a marked change in market sentiment has taken place. Markets had been expecting that the monetary tightenings that began in most countries in 1999 had further to run, but they have now swung to expecting easings. As a result, short-term yields have fallen. This was most pronounced in the US, though was true in other major countries also. At the same time, the upward trend of the US dollar stalled, and bond yields also fell. ", " After raising the Fed funds target by 175 basis points, to 6.5 per cent, in the 12 months to May 2000, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged (but assessed that the risks were mainly toward heightened inflationary pressures) until the last meeting of the year on 19 December. At that meeting the Fed moved to a view that the risks were ‘weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future’. Markets expected that this would mean that the Fed funds rate would be cut at the next Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting at end January. Yields on 90-day securities moved down from 6.5 per cent in early December to 6.25 per cent by end December – i.e. 25 points below the then Fed funds target. ", " On 3 January, the Fed surprised markets by cutting the Fed funds target by 50 basis points to 6 per cent. This was the first inter-meeting move since October 1998, when the Fed eased following the financial market dislocation that followed the near collapse of a major hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). It was also the first 50 basis point cut since the early 1990s recession. At its 31 January meeting, the Fed cut policy rates by a further 50 basis points to 5.50 per cent, and continued to maintain its easing bias. In response to these developments, financial markets moved to price-in further easings, and 90-day yields fell to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.25 per cent</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 7)</span>. ", " While the change in policy climate and sentiment has been most marked in the US, markets are assuming that the interest rate cycle has peaked in the other industrialised economies also. The Bank of Canada cut official interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.5 per cent on 23 January and the Reserve Bank cut rates in Australia by <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 basis points</span> to 5.75 per cent on 7 February. Other industrial country central banks have kept official interest rates steady. The European Central Bank (ECB) last changed rates in October 2000, when it raised rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.75 per cent</span>. This brought the total rise over the previous 12 months to 225 points. The Bank of England has held rates steady, at 6.00 per cent, since February 2000; and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has left rates unchanged at <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.5 per cent</span> since May 2000. Sweden was the last economy to increase official rates – by 25 basis points to 4 per cent in December. In Japan, overnight rates were raised in August 2000 thereby terminating the extraordinary ‘zero interest rate policy’ of the previous two years, but the Bank of Japan has left rates unchanged at <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.25 per cent</span> since (Graph 8). ", " In all major countries apart from Japan, 90-day rates are currently below official rates, in marked contrast to the situation a few months ago (see Table 1). ", " The decision by the Fed to ease monetary policy enabled an immediate easing of monetary conditions in those emerging markets with exchange rates fixed to the US dollar – Argentina, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Signs of weaker growth in a number of other emerging markets, reflecting sluggish exports, have raised expectations of a more widespread easing in the monetary stance among these countries. The Philippines central bank has already lowered official interest rates in the past two months as political developments have allowed some unwinding of its aggressive tightening in October to underpin the peso at the time when political instability was rising. ", " The changing economic climate has seen bond yields in the US fall sharply over recent months. Yields on US 10-year Treasury notes fell around 80 basis points between mid October and early January, reaching a low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.90 per cent</span> before the first Fed easing. This fall was partly driven by the extreme instability in the US share market, which increased demand for more stable and secure investments such as government bonds. Since then, bond yields have increased modestly, to settle at around 5.20 per cent. The stabilisation of the US share market has contributed to this. ", " The US yield curve has been inverted for most of 2000, with the degree of inversion increasing to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">160 basis points</span> in the days before the early January rate cut, a larger degree of inversion than that seen in the financial turmoil surrounding LTCM in 1998, and around the same as that seen in the lead-up to the early 1990s recession. While normally such a degree of inversion would be taken to indicate that markets are expecting a contraction in the economy, on this occasion several factors make it harder to interpret the implications of movements in yields. One of these is the continuing budget surpluses in the US and the resultant reduction in supply of bonds on issue, which may be dampening bond yields. This possible distortion is avoided by looking at yields on AAA-rated corporate bonds. The spread between these bonds and the cash rate also inverted in late December, though less markedly than that for Treasuries and also by less than in the lead-up to the early 1990s recession. This measure, however, is also affected by special factors at present – namely rising credit spreads on all private debt in the US. Nevertheless, it does suggest that markets do expect significant economic weakness ahead. ", " The spreads on corporate bonds in the US have increased significantly over recent months, suggesting an increase in concerns about credit quality in US markets. Spreads across the entire credit spectrum have risen, exceeding the highs seen in 1998 (Graph 9). Spreads on high quality AAA-rated paper relative to Treasury securities increased from around 80 basis points to 125 basis points over 2000. Spreads on the lower-quality bonds rose by more, with the ‘junk’ bond sector suffering the largest rise. Spreads on these latter securities moved to about 700 basis points over Treasury securities of comparable maturity, up over 300 basis points during the year. Since the Fed cut interest rates in early January, credit spreads have narrowed somewhat, suggesting that markets anticipate that the easing of monetary policy will contain the increase in corporate risk. ", " In European markets, yields on long-term government bonds have fallen in recent months, though less so than in the US. After trading in a relatively narrow range around 5.2 per cent for several months, the 10-year German yield moved down from mid November, falling by around 50 basis points by early January. Since then yields have risen by over 10 basis points to trade around 4.8 per cent. The spread between US and German 10-year government bonds narrowed by about 20 basis points, to around 40 basis points, over December and January. Japanese long bond yields increased modestly after the Bank of Japan ended the ‘zero interest rate policy’ in August 2000, reaching highs around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.00 per cent</span>, before falling back to their current level of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.50 per cent</span> as weaker economic data accumulated in the latter part of the year (Graph 10). ", " In emerging markets, bond yields rose through to December as markets became increasingly risk averse, both because of general concerns about the impact on emerging markets of the slowdown in the US and specific problems in several countries, particularly in Argentina and Turkey. The spread to US bond yields widened to almost 800 basis points, from a low of around 630 basis points earlier in the year. However, as with the US corporate market, the general risks surrounding emerging markets were seen to narrow somewhat as the Fed began to cut official interest rates in the US. This saw spreads fall back below 700 points by the end of January <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 11)</span>. ", " The prospect of significantly weaker economic growth and a string of disappointing earnings announcements, particularly by technology companies, have weighed on equity markets. US markets have led the fall over recent months. The Wilshire index, the broadest measure of US share prices (accounting for over 90 per cent of listed companies) fell by 14 per cent in the three months to early January. While the S&amp;P 500 experienced similar falls, the Dow Jones index (which covers largely ‘blue chip’ stocks) was flat over this period as investors moved back toward lower risk investments. At the same time the technology rich NASDAQ fell around 35 per cent (Graph 12). All the major US stock indices saw large falls in 2000, the first year of negative returns for the broad-based indices since 1994. However, since the Fed began easing monetary policy, US equity markets have recovered modestly, with the Wilshire up 5 per cent, the Dow up 3 per cent and the NASDAQ up 14 per cent. ", " Share prices in most other countries have followed the US markets down over 2000. Depending on the composition of share price indices in the different countries, some peaked early in 2000, around the time of the peak in technology shares, while others experienced a later peak (Table 2). Broad–based indices in most countries were down by around 10 per cent over 2000. Only in two countries – Canada and Australia – did share prices show a net rise over the year. ", " Among the major countries, the biggest fall in share prices in 2000 was in Japan. Share prices in that country fell sharply in the first half of 2000 as the Japanese index was heavily affected by the collapse of technology stocks. More recently, pessimism regarding the outlook for the Japanese economy led to a further substantial slide in share prices, with the Nikkei falling to levels not seen since the Asian crisis. ", " As Japanese equity prices fell, the market began to focus on the potential impact on the solvency of the Japanese banking sector and, given the banks' role in funding the corporate sector, on the economy more generally. However, despite continuing problems with the banks' balance sheets, price-based market assessments of the banking industry do not appear to have deteriorated significantly over the past year. The market value of bank shares has not under-performed the market average, as was the case in the lead-up to the banking problems of 1998 (Graph 13). In addition, the ‘Japan premium’ (the additional margin which Japanese banks must pay to borrow short-term funds on world markets) remains negligible, compared with a peak of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">80 basis points</span> at the time of the banking crisis in 1998. The recapitalisation package announced in October 1998 helped reduce this premium. ", " Equity prices in the Asian-crisis economies – Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand – experienced average falls in the order of 40 per cent in 2000, to levels only marginally above those reached during the 1997–98 financial crisis (Graph 14). The slump was largely due to an assessment by markets that these economies were vulnerable to slowing world growth, and in particular to a downturn in the global electronics cycle. However, since the first easing by the US Fed, share prices in the region have recovered modestly, rising by 10 per cent in the year to date. Latin American share prices also registered a recent upturn, following weakness in 2000. ", " The past few months have seen a fundamental change in the momentum underpinning movements in the three major global currencies. After strengthening significantly on a trade-weighted basis over recent years, the US dollar peaked in mid November as evidence emerged that the US economy was slowing significantly. Between mid November and the start of January, the trade-weighted US dollar fell by 5 per cent, after increasing 13 per cent up until that point in 2000 (Graph 15). The Fed's surprise easing in early January prompted a further move downward in the dollar. However, as markets have come to see this as an indicator of the Fed's determination to prevent a prolonged slowdown in the US economy and some of the gloom surrounding the economic outlook dissipated, the US dollar stabilised and has since moved modestly higher against the major currencies (other than the yen). ", " The peak of the US trade-weighted index broadly coincided with the trough in the Euro/US dollar bilateral exchange rate. From its introduction at the beginning of 1999, the euro fell by close to 30 per cent to an historic low of US82.3 cents in October 2000. Concerted intervention by the G7 central banks in September, and subsequent bilateral intervention by the European Central Bank, helped to stabilise the euro, which then strengthened by over 15 per cent to reach a peak of US95.8 cents in early January, immediately after the US Fed's surprise easing. More recently the Euro has fallen again against the US dollar as the bearishness regarding the US dollar has eased (Graph 16). ", " Despite the slowdown in the US economy, the yen has weakened against the US dollar in recent months. After trading in a 105 to 110 range between January and November 2000, the yen fell to almost 120 against the US dollar by mid January. It has since generally remained in a range of 115 to 120. ", " Elsewhere in Asia, the currencies of countries with floating exchange rates appear to have stabilised against the US dollar after falling through most of 2000 (Graph 17). This has gone hand-in-hand with a modest recovery in domestic share markets in the region. Most floating Latin American currencies also depreciated against the US dollar over the course of 2000, but there too the trend may have been arrested recently. The Brazilian real has been stable in recent months, and the Mexican and Chilean pesos have appreciated marginally against the US dollar. ", " Movements in the Australian dollar have to a large degree continued to reflect fluctuations in investor sentiment towards the US dollar. The strong demand for US dollars that characterised most of 2000 eventually moderated late in the year with the run of weak economic data in the US and, shortly after, the surprise monetary policy announcement. The resulting fall in the US dollar on world markets saw the Australian dollar rise quite sharply against it between late November and early January, as did all other major currencies apart from the yen. ", " The winding-back of expectations of the growth of US economic activity was evident throughout the December quarter but particularly late in the quarter. The US dollar stopped rising in trade-weighted terms in November and the Australian dollar stabilised at around US52 cents. This emerging tendency towards stability was assisted by several rounds of quite sizeable intervention by the Reserve Bank to support the exchange rate. Though the Australian dollar briefly fell to a low of US50.7 cents in late November, it recovered sharply to above US55 cents in December as growth estimates for the US continued to be wound back much more quickly than those for Australia <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 18)</span>. ", " The announcement of a 50 basis point cut by the Fed in early January surprised most observers, and tended to weaken the US dollar immediately after the announcement. At that time, the Australian dollar climbed briefly above US57 cents, more than 10 per cent above its November low. Thereafter, as US asset markets settled, sentiment about the US dollar improved. At the same time, the consensus growth outlook for Australia was also reduced more sharply. The Australian dollar declined to around US54–55 cents (Graph 19). Markets had already fully priced-in the 50 basis point easing in Australia in early February and its announcement had little impact on the exchange rate. ", " With the US dollar remaining the major focus of markets in recent months, most other major currencies (except the yen) have shown similar movements against it (Graph 20). This has meant that correlations between the Australian dollar and these other currencies, particularly the euro, have been much higher than usual. Correlations of daily movements between the euro and the Australian dollar have increased to around 0.75 from 0.25 early last year and an average of close to zero during the 1990s (Graph 21). The most recent observations are comparable with the correlation between the Australian dollar and the US dollar when the local currency was regarded as being one of the ‘US dollar bloc’ currencies. That strong relationship, which had been prevalent throughout most of the floating period, broke down around 1997 when markets brought about a significant depreciation of the local currency in reaction to the onset of the Asian crisis. ", " Even though the Australian dollar has been quite steady against many other currencies, the trade-weighted index rose noticeably in the closing weeks of last year and early this year. This reflected in part the importance of the US dollar in the TWI, but also the fact that the yen weakened at the same time; together, these two currencies (and currencies tied or managed to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar)</span> make up about half the trade weights. ", " With the recovery of the Australian dollar from its lows in November, the Bank has remained out of the market, except for a few occasions in December and January when market liquidity was seasonally low and the Bank intervened on a small scale to ensure that the exchange rate did not behave erratically in the thin conditions. ", " Growth in the Australian economy slowed in the second half of the year, after a very strong first half. The extent of the slowdown is difficult to gauge as most indicators of the pace of activity have been influenced by the introduction of the new tax system and, to a lesser extent, by the staging of the Olympic Games. At the same time, the composition of growth has continued to shift, with stronger growth in exports providing some offset to the weaker growth in domestic demand (Graph 22, Table 3). ", " The increase in real GDP of 0.6 per cent in the September quarter recorded in the national accounts was less than that in recent quarters, but was particularly affected by the changes to the tax system and the Olympic Games. The net effect of the GST was to transfer activity from the second half of the year into the first half. This was most prevalent in the housing sector where the fall in dwelling investment in the September quarter subtracted around 1¼ percentage points from growth. The new tax arrangements also affected the timing of some consumption spending, most notably motor vehicle purchases, and business investment spending. ", " In contrast to the effects of the tax system, the Olympics provided a net boost to GDP in the September quarter. The direct effect in the form of higher exports (broadcast rights and ticket sales to non-residents) and consumption (ticket sales to residents) is estimated to have been just under ¾ of a per cent of GDP, but this will have been offset to some extent by the diversion of spending from other forms of consumption and the disruption to business activity during the staging of the Games. The most recent indicators suggest that the slower overall pace of growth continued in the last few months of the year. ", " Consumer spending grew at a more moderate pace over the past year. Household consumption increased at an annualised rate of 2 ¾ per cent in the September quarter, compared with growth of around 5 per cent per annum in recent years. While retail trade increased strongly in the December quarter, there is no doubt that the strong consumption growth of recent years has slowed. ", " A number of factors have contributed to reduce the growth of consumption, including the rise in the interest burden of households due to increases in household debt and the tightening of monetary policy since <span class=\"no-wrap\">November 1999</span>, and a slowdown in the accumulation of household wealth. Higher petrol prices are also likely to have led households to reduce spending on other goods and services, along with the requirement for some households to pay the second instalment on their purchases of shares in the Telstra 2 float by early November. These contractionary influences have been partly offset by continued strong growth in household borrowing and the boost to household income from the tax cuts and benefit increases associated with the new tax system. ", " Consumption growth as recorded in the September quarter was boosted by domestic sales of Olympic tickets and domestic tourism expenditures as residents of other states travelled to watch the Games. However, the tendency for households to spend more time at home or involved in Olympics-related activities is likely to have reduced expenditure in other areas over this period. ", " There was also a marked shift in consumption patterns between the June and September quarters as a result of the relative price changes associated with the introduction of the new tax system. The largest shift in expenditure was on motor vehicles, which was around 40 per cent higher in the September quarter than in the June quarter, reflecting the lower taxes and hence prices after 1 July. Motor vehicle sales have remained at a high level in recent months, though somewhat below the initial spike when the tax changes were introduced <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 23)</span>. These price effects were amplified by manufacturers' decisions to delay the launch of a number of new models onto the Australian market until after 1 July. Other areas of expenditure such as clothing and footwear and household furnishings declined following the tax changes as consumers had brought forward their expenditure to earlier quarters in anticipation of higher prices after 1 July. ", " The pace of retail spending, which accounts for around one-third of total consumer spending, also slowed in 2000. Retail spending has been particularly volatile over the course of the year because of the changes in the tax system. It fell by 3.3 per cent in real terms in the September quarter, but rose by 1.8 per cent in the December quarter so that its level in the second half of 2000 was lower than in the first half. The slowdown has been most noticeable in spending on clothing, recreational goods and hospitality and services. ", " In line with the slowdown in consumption growth, consumer sentiment has fallen from the high levels of 1999. It has varied considerably over the past year, reflecting uncertainty about the impact of the tax changes, financial market volatility and higher interest rates and petrol prices. Nevertheless, in recent months consumer sentiment appears to have stabilised at a level slightly above its long-run average, which would be consistent with continued moderate growth in consumption. ", " Household disposable income grew by around 4 per cent in the September quarter, boosted by the increase in social assistance benefits and decrease in income taxes associated with the changes to the tax system. The sharp increase in disposable income combined with the slowdown in growth in consumption expenditure resulted in an increase in the household saving ratio to 4 per cent of disposable income in the quarter, up from 2.7 per cent a year ago. ", " Growth in household borrowing has moderated from the very fast pace of the first half of last year, mainly reflecting a deceleration in lending for housing, and particularly lending for investment property. Personal credit growth has also eased a little in recent months though it remains strong, especially in the form of credit card and overdraft lending. Total credit to the household sector increased at an annual rate of around 11½ per cent over the six months to December, down from a rate of nearly 18 per cent in June, a figure which had been boosted by the pre-GST surge in housing activity. ", " While the overall rate of growth of household borrowing has declined in recent months, it continues to exceed the growth of incomes, and hence the ratio of household debt to disposable income has increased further. This continues a trend that has been evident in Australia for more than a decade. In large part, the trend increase in the debt-to-income ratio represents a long-term structural change – households have been adjusting to a deregulated financial system in which credit has become more freely available and, with lower interest rates, is more affordable. In the course of this process, the Australian household sector has moved from having a relatively low level of debt by international standards to a position where the debt ratio is comparable to that in other countries (Graph 24). (If unincorporated enterprises were included, the debt ratio in Australia at present would be around 10 percentage points higher than is shown in the graph.) ", " While it is difficult to establish what would be a sustainable debt ratio for the household sector in the longer term, the rapid increase does pose the risk of some households becoming overstretched, particularly if the level of borrowing were to continue growing at the rates seen in the past couple of years. One measure of the capacity of households to service their debt is the ratio of interest payments to disposable income. The combination of increased household indebtedness and higher interest rates in the past year has seen this ratio continue to increase, to a level higher than the most recent peak reached in the mid 1990s, but still well below the late 1980s peak <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 25)</span>. ", " After increasing at a relatively rapid pace for much of the past four years, growth in the value of household assets has slowed considerably in recent quarters. The pattern is difficult to gauge because measures of the value of houses, which account for the bulk of household assets, have been distorted by compositional changes in the mix of house buyers related to the introduction of the new tax system. The availability of the Federal Government's First Home Owner Grant after 1 July (and a concession on stamp duty in NSW) encouraged first-home buyers to delay their house purchases until the September quarter. As first-home buyers are likely to buy cheaper dwellings on average, this boosted the average purchase price in the June quarter and depressed it in the September quarter. The CBA/HIA measure of established house prices, which is likely to be most affected by this change, fell by 10.5 per cent in the September quarter, after rising by 5.2 per cent in the June quarter (Graph 26). The REIA and ABS measures of house prices, which are less affected, fell by 3.8 per cent and 0.1 per cent, respectively, in the September quarter. ", " Growth in household financial assets has also slowed in recent quarters (Table 4), primarily reflecting slower growth in the value of both direct and indirect equity holdings. Nevertheless, the value of household direct equity holdings has continued to rise, in contrast to the US where the value of household direct equity holdings fell by around 13 per cent in the six months to the September quarter. ", " Following record growth over the year to June 2000, residential construction activity declined sharply in the second half of the year. According to the national accounts, private dwelling investment fell by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> in the September quarter, to be around 7 per cent lower than a year earlier, with sharp falls in both the construction of new dwellings and alterations and additions. As a share of GDP, dwelling investment fell from around 6½ per cent to 5½ per cent – although this returned it only to the same level as at the two previous <span class=\"no-wrap\">cyclical peaks (Graph 27)</span>. Forward indicators point to a further, though much smaller, decline in activity in the December quarter. ", " The shape of this housing cycle has been significantly affected by the introduction of the GST, which created the incentive for dwelling construction to be undertaken before 1 July. Combined with the effects of the rise in interest rates, this led to the very sharp decline in activity in the housing sector in the second half of 2000. In contrast to previous dwelling cycles, at this stage there is little evidence of a large oversupply of dwellings, which suggests that the downturn may not be as protracted as in the past. In addition, the prospects for a recovery in the dwelling sector have been bolstered by an increase in affordability in recent months as growth in house prices appears to have eased and as fixed home loan rates have declined. ", " Dwelling activity is likely to fall further in the December quarter and leading indicators suggest that the lower level of activity is likely to persist into the first part of 2001. However, a number of forward indicators appear to have reached bottom and suggest some pick-up in activity is in prospect later in 2001. The number of private new dwellings approved has increased in the last quarter of 2000, to be 12 per cent above the trough reached in September, although they remain 36 per cent lower than a year earlier (Graph 28). The increase in approvals has been evenly spread across houses and medium-density units. The number and value of loan approvals rose strongly in November, recovering from the low levels recorded in September and October. Much of the strength was in lending to investors although loans to owner-occupiers also picked up. The downturn in the housing sector has been broadly similar in magnitude across the states, and most states have shown signs of a recovery in recent months. ", " Reflecting the varying economic conditions, business surveys have reported marked differences in business sentiment across industries. The ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturing firms reported a decline in expected business conditions over the next six months. The Dun and Bradstreet survey, which focuses on the manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade sectors, also reported a decline in the period ahead. In contrast, the more broadly based ABS Survey of Business Expectations and NAB quarterly survey reported an expectation of a significant improvement in business conditions over the coming year in the mining sector, and a continuation of buoyant conditions in the property and business services sector, but a worsening in conditions in most other sectors. The NAB survey also indicated that exporters were enjoying good conditions. ", " In addition to the variation across industries, there have also been major differences in sentiment between smaller and larger businesses. According to the ABS Survey of Business Expectations, large firms have a positive outlook for sales and profit growth over the coming year whereas small firms are reporting a sharp deterioration in sales and profit growth. ", " Notwithstanding this variation across sectors, the business surveys consistently suggest a deterioration in business sentiment for the economy as a whole in the second half of 2000. The survey responses are, however, less definitive on the exact causes of this change. In general, businesses report, as they almost always do, that the factor most constraining production or profitability is demand or orders, with an array of other factors playing a minor role (Table 5). There have been only minor changes to this pattern of late, and hence it is necessary to look beyond the survey responses in forming an assessment of the reasons behind the decline in confidence. ", " On this occasion, the extremely sharp downturn in housing activity in the second half of 2000 has reduced demand and employment, not only in the housing industry itself but in those parts of manufacturing that supply the housing sector. Also, higher petrol prices have reduced the amount of income that consumers have available to purchase other goods and services. Similarly, higher import prices have contributed to a squeeze on margins in some parts of manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing, although in other parts of the economy such as those that export or compete against imports, profit opportunities have expanded. According to the Yellow Pages survey, small businesses also had some difficulty in changing accounting and record-keeping systems to comply with the new tax system. The rise in interest rates earlier in the year would also have contributed to some reduction in business confidence, particularly during the period when further increases were expected. Finally, over the most recent few months, the gloomier news from the United States, particularly concerning its share markets, would have influenced business confidence in Australia. ", " The transition to the new tax system has meant that companies will be paying tax on income earned in the current year at the same time that they are paying tax on income earned in 1999/00. Transitional arrangements have been implemented to alleviate this problem by allowing some payments to be deferred (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>), and hence this should not have a major effect on business cash flow provided businesses take full advantage of the deferral arrangements. In its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO), the Government reported that there appeared to be a short lag between when businesses report GST receipts on sales and when they claim input tax credits relating to those sales, and also that there was a lag in the processing of net refunds by the Australian Tax Office. ", " Aggregate measures suggest that, on average, the financial position of the corporate sector has remained strong. Corporate GOS rose by over 17 per cent over the year to September and was at an historical high as a share of GDP <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 29)</span>. Profit growth in the mining sector has been particularly strong over the past year, whereas profit levels in the retail and wholesale sectors appear to have fallen. There is some evidence that conditions for small business are less favourable, with profits of unincorporated enterprises falling by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter, although they are nearly 6½ per cent higher over the year. ", " The business surveys reported lower profitability in the December quarter, although again there was variation across sectors and between small and large businesses (Graph 30). The broadest measure shown by the NAB survey indicated that profitability had fallen to about the same level as in 1996. The Dun and Bradstreet survey and the ACCI survey of manufacturing showed a similar result. On the other hand, the survey of manufacturing carried out by the Australian Industry Group and the Yellow Pages survey of small business, showed profitability at a lower level than in the mid 1990s. ", " Aggregate business investment has been flat for a number of quarters, although this masks contrasting developments in the components of investment. Investment in new machinery and equipment increased by nearly 5 per cent in the September quarter (Graph 31) and by 8 per cent over the past year. Some part of the increase in the September quarter may have reflected the deferral of purchases to take advantage of the fall in the price of some investment goods with the abolition of wholesale sales tax. The outlook for investment in machinery and equipment for 2000/01, as measured in the latest ABS Capital Expenditure Survey appears quite positive. Firms upgraded their machinery and equipment investment plans significantly, implying around 6 per cent growth in nominal terms over 2000/01. Much of the expected growth is in the communications, property and business services and mining sectors, where recently business sentiment has been more buoyant. ", " New investment in buildings and structures continued to decline from the peak reached almost two years ago, falling by a further 15 per cent in the September quarter. Expenditure on engineering construction has been particularly weak and is around one-third lower than a year earlier. Much of this decline has been due to weakness in resource-related projects, although in the September quarter, work done on infrastructure projects also declined. While committed projects in the quarter, as reported in the Access Investment Monitor, rose to their highest level since the early 1990s, many of the major projects are still in the planning stage and are likely to have little impact on work done until well into 2001/02. However, non-residential building approvals point to an increase in office construction, underpinned by the gradual tightening in CBD office space availability and the consequent strong growth in office rents. ", " The other major component of business investment, expenditure on intangible fixed assets, rose moderately in the September quarter to be nearly 8 per cent higher than a year ago. Increases in expenditure on computer software (around 80 per cent of the total) and minerals and petroleum exploration contributed to the growth in the quarter. The increase in exploration expenditure, together with strong profitability, points to the possibility of a rebound in capital expenditure in the mining sector, which has been subdued for a number of quarters. ", " The availability of funds is not likely to be a constraint on business investment. As discussed above, profit levels are high, even if down a little from their September quarter peak. Net equity raisings have also been high with gross raisings remaining buoyant and buy-back activity easing. At the same time, businesses have not been using debt financing as much recently, possibly reflecting higher interest rates charged by intermediaries and the slowdown in economic activity. Business credit growth has slowed to an annualised rate of around 5 per cent over the six months to December from <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> over the six months to June. In the December quarter, the slowing in intermediated business borrowing was offset to a small degree by increased debt raising through capital markets (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’). ", " Measures of the corporate interest burden remain low by historical standards, reflecting a combination of high profitability and relatively low levels of interest rates and corporate indebtedness (Graph 32). Debt-to-equity ratios have been broadly flat over the past few years, and remain well below levels of a decade ago. ", " In November the Commonwealth Government reassessed its budget forecasts in its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO). The expected underlying cash surpluses for 2000/01 and for 2001/02 were both revised up by about $1½ billion, while the estimate of the actual surplus in the previous year was revised upwards by a larger amount. The revision to the estimate for the current year in part reflected upward revisions to forecasts of GDP and employment growth, and ongoing base effects of <span class=\"no-wrap\">stronger-than-expected</span> tax receipts in 1999/2000. Higher Pay-As-You-Go withholding tax receipts, company tax receipts and the petroleum resource rent tax contributed the most to the upward revision to revenue in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2000/01</span>. The upward revision to expected revenue was partially offset by higher expenditures. ", " While the estimated level of the surplus for both the current and the previous year has been revised upwards, the revised estimates suggest that the Commonwealth Budget position remains expansionary in its impact on growth in the economy in the current fiscal year. Using the change in the surplus between years as a rough indicator of the impact on growth, the revised estimates indicate that the surplus in 2000/01 will be 1.4 per cent of GDP lower than in the previous year. This compares with an estimated reduction of 0.8 per cent of GDP at budget time (Table 6). Subsequent to the latest estimates, the Government has announced spending packages on roads and innovation worth $1.6 billion and nearly $3 billion respectively over the next five years, with most of the impact occurring in the later years of that period. ", " Conditions in the labour market have softened in recent months, with employment growth slowing from the rapid pace experienced around the middle of the year and the unemployment rate edging up after having fallen to its lowest level in a decade in the September quarter (Graph 33). After rising by 3.5 per cent over the year to the September quarter 2000, employment fell by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter, but remained 2.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. The unemployment rate rose slightly in the December quarter to 6½ per cent, around ½ of a percentage point lower than in the December quarter 1999. Employment fell slightly in January, and the unemployment rate increased to 6.7 per cent. The participation rate has declined from its recent peak but remains a little higher than a year earlier. ", " The composition of employment has been affected by the conjunction of the introduction of the new tax system and the Olympic Games. In particular, the strong growth in construction employment over the past couple of years was partly reversed in the second half of the year as activity in that sector declined from its pre-GST peak. Employment has also fallen over the past year in the wholesale trade and manufacturing sectors, whereas it has risen strongly in the service sector, particularly in hospitality and property and business services. ", " Over the year to the December quarter, most states experienced solid employment growth and declining unemployment rates (Table 7), with particularly rapid employment growth being recorded in Victoria. In the latter part of the year, employment growth slowed in all states except Western Australia and Tasmania. Employment growth over the past year has been stronger in regions outside the capital cities. Consequently, unemployment rates in these areas have generally fallen more rapidly over the past year, but still typically remain higher than in the capital cities. ", " Most forward-looking indicators of labour demand suggest that employment growth will remain subdued over the next six months or so. The number of jobs advertised in newspapers has fallen to be around 20 per cent lower than its peak in May 2000, although recently there have been some signs of recovery. The ANZ Bank series increased by 3.7 per cent from November to January, while the index of skilled job advertisements compiled by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) recorded a large increase over the same period. The decline since the peak last May has been exacerbated by the trend towards advertising for information-technology professionals on the internet, but the number of advertisements for tradespersons – and for construction workers in particular – has fallen sharply, in line with the decline in construction activity. ", " The major surveys of business expectations also point to a softer outlook for the labour market (Graph 34). The NAB quarterly survey reported that employment intentions for the March quarter have declined to quite low levels, and the ACCI-Westpac survey indicates that hiring conditions are weak in the manufacturing sector. ", " In contrast to the other labour market indicators, the ABS measure of job vacancies has remained much more buoyant. Based on a survey of employers rather than a count of newspaper advertisements, the ABS measure indicates that the number of job vacancies has risen in each of the past seven quarters and in the December quarter, was 14.6 per cent higher than a year earlier. The ABS series has been boosted by strong growth of job vacancies in the property and business services sector, which includes vacancies for IT workers likely to have been missed by counts of newspaper job advertising; in addition, the series has not been as severely affected by the recent contraction in the construction industry. ", " Strong trading partner growth, the lower Australian dollar and the Olympics all continued to support Australia's external accounts during the second half of 2000. From the recent peak of nearly 3 per cent of GDP, reached in September 1999, the quarterly trade deficit narrowed to around ½ of one per cent of GDP in the December quarter 2000. The staging of the Olympics and the Paralympics obviously contributed to this outcome, and according to the ABS, boosted exports by around 0.9 per cent of GDP in the September quarter and <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.1 per cent</span> of GDP in the December quarter. After abstracting from these events, however, it is still clear that the trade balance has narrowed considerably, driven by continued strong growth in exports and some moderation in imports (Graph 35). ", " The value of exports increased by over 4 per cent in the December quarter and was 27 per cent higher than a year earlier (abstracting from the effect of the sale of a frigate in the December quarter 1999). The lower exchange rate ensured that prices in Australian dollar terms contributed to the quarterly rise. Export growth has been strong to all major destinations over the past year, with particularly strong growth to east Asia and Japan <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 36)</span>. Much of the increase in the value of exports to east Asia and Japan has been in resources, although service exports to this region also rose considerably in the December quarter, following weakness in the peak Olympic period. ", " Resources exports have been the fastest growing export category over the past year, and this continued into the December quarter. Over the year to December, resource export earnings increased by 45 per cent, excluding re-exported gold. Although higher prices have contributed to some of this increase, the quantities of mineral fuels, metals and other non-rural goods exported have also risen strongly, in several cases as a result of new production coming on stream. The increase in mineral fuel exports has been most pronounced for crude oil, where quantities exported have risen by over 50 per cent over the last year and have nearly doubled over the last two years. ", " Earnings for rural exports rose modestly in the December quarter, driven by higher prices. The value of greasy wool and meat exports both increased as a result of strong external demand and higher production, but the rise was offset by lower values of cereal exports. In the near term, the quantity of rural exports is likely to be adversely affected by the unfavourable climatic conditions experienced recently. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates that the volume of total farm production will be 4.6 per cent lower in the current fiscal year, due to the recent drought in Western Australia and floods in the eastern states. ", " Service exports fell in the December quarter, following the Olympics-related boost in the September quarter. The ABS estimates that the Olympics and Paralympics added $1,400 million to service exports in the September quarter and $160 million in the December quarter. Excluding the direct effects of the Olympics, the value of service exports grew by about 4 per cent in the quarter, to be over 15 per cent higher over the year, driven largely by increased tourism receipts. Although the Olympics seemed to displace some tourism from Japan, <span class=\"no-wrap\">New Zealand</span> and parts of east Asia, arrivals from these regions have since recovered, while the strong growth in the number of visitors from the US and EU has moderated. ", " Manufactured exports rose further in the December quarter, to be 20 per cent higher over the year (excluding frigates). It is possible that the modest easing in growth in the latest quarter reflected the moderation in global growth that has taken place, although the current level of the exchange rate implies that manufactured exports remain very competitive. Over the past year, growth has been spread across most major components of manufactured exports. Exports of telecommunications goods, while volatile, have been at a high level. Growth in manufactured exports has been quite widespread across all major destinations. ", " The value of imports grew only slightly in the December quarter and was generally weak during the second half of 2000. This was consistent with both the significant depreciation of the currency during the year and the moderation in domestic demand growth that has taken place. Of these two influences, the exchange rate has probably been the more significant, as it has contributed to an increase in the import price index by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> over the past year. ", " Weakness has been evident across each of the major categories of imports, and has been particularly noticeable for imports of capital goods. Some components, however, have continued to grow strongly. Changes to the tax system, for example, contributed to a 30 per cent rise in the quantity of motor vehicles imported over the year to December. Telecommunications equipment imports also continued to grow strongly in December, with mobile phones accounting for about half of the quarterly increase. ", " The continued strong demand for imported telecommunications equipment is contributing to the ongoing rise in the share of imports from east Asia (excluding Japan) (Graph 37). Overall, the value of imports from this region rose by $1.8 billion over the year to the December quarter. Computer and telecommunications imports accounted for about a third of the increase, and petroleum for a further quarter. ", " The net income deficit has continued to narrow, falling from 3.2 per cent of GDP a year ago to 2.6 per cent of GDP in the September quarter. Combined with the recent strong growth in exports, this narrowing has implied that the ratio of net income payments to exports has fallen to around 12 per cent, its lowest level since the <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 1980s</span>. ", " Australia's net foreign debt increased by 9.6 per cent in the September quarter to $294 billion, or 46 per cent of GDP. There were sizeable net debt inflows to the private sector and the depreciation in the Australian dollar increased the measured Australian dollar value of external debt. Net equity liabilities fell, largely due to the depreciation increasing the value of equity investments abroad in local currency terms. Net equity inflows have been fairly weak since September 1999, especially relative to the preceding two years, reflecting both lower inflows and greater participation in offshore equity markets by Australian investors. Overall, net foreign liabilities increased by 3.6 per cent in the September quarter to around 63 per cent of GDP. ", " Commodity prices increased significantly in the first half of 2000, but, in foreign-currency terms, growth weakened during the second half of the year; over the six months to January, the Bank's commodity price index increased by around 2 per cent to be 8 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 38). All major components of the index increased a little over the past six months. Oil prices have remained volatile. ", " The movements in the exchange rate over the past year, however, implied that in Australian dollar terms, commodity prices reached record levels by historical standards early in the December quarter. Although some of these gains were subsequently retraced, they remain nearly 20 per cent higher over the year. ", " The increase in rural prices over recent periods largely reflected concerns that unfavourable weather conditions in Australia and some other parts of the world would restrict the supply of rural commodities. Wheat prices increased particularly strongly in the December quarter, by over 15 per cent in SDR terms. Wool prices, in foreign-currency terms, were weak early in the December quarter, due to a run-down in the wool stockpile and reports of higher production, before recovering quite strongly to be around 12 per cent above the levels prevailing a year ago. ", " Most non-rural commodity prices, other than base metals, also rose during the December quarter, although gold prices remained soft. The price of gold in SDR terms fell by around 1 per cent. Coal prices have increased particularly strongly in recent periods, driven by persistently firm demand from Asia and tight supply in the region. Over the December quarter, prices received for coal increased by around 8 per cent in US dollar terms, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">24 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier. ", " Base metal prices weakened early in the December quarter, before falling inventory levels led to some recovery. In January, however, they were a little below levels recorded a year earlier. Aluminium prices fell by around 2 per cent in the December quarter. Although the prospect of slower global growth placed downward pressure on prices, the relatively high oil price fuelled expectations of higher aluminium production costs and lower supply. Copper and lead prices firmed slightly in January on perceptions that global inventories are quite low. ", " Oil prices have varied considerably in recent months. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was above US$30/barrel until early December, but it then fell sharply to finish the December quarter about <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$3/barrel</span> lower <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 39)</span>. Throughout this period, the price of oil was held up by intermittent military tensions in the Middle East, forecasts of cold weather in the Northern Hemisphere, and low oil inventory levels. OPEC's production increase in October did little to ease prices because it was thought unlikely to match projected increases in global demand. The US release of 30 million barrels from emergency reserves in November was more effective; it boosted US inventory levels noticeably at a time when they usually fall. Oil prices dropped markedly in response to this. Since early January, prices have recovered somewhat, following OPEC's decision to cut target production by 1.5 million barrels which partially unwinds the 3.7 million-barrel increase over 2000. Oil is currently priced at around $US30 per barrel. ", " In response to the strength of domestic demand conditions during much of 1999 and 2000, and the consequent risks to inflation, monetary policy was tightened in a series of steps between November 1999 and August 2000. The increases in short-term interest rates in that period are likely to have reduced scope for discretionary expenditures and therefore to have exerted a dampening influence on domestic demand during the year. The size of the overall interest rate increase, however, was relatively mild in terms of recent historical experience, with rates rising from a below-average position in late 1999 to levels that were close to, or still slightly below, their average for the low-inflation period (i.e. the period since 1992). ", " In assessing the overall impact of financial conditions on the economy it is also important to take account of a broader range of variables including developments in the financial aggregates, share prices, capital markets and the exchange rate. Share markets in Australia have held up considerably better than has been the case in other countries, notably the US. Credit growth in Australia has been quite strong over the past year and, while it has slowed in recent months, remains readily available to households and businesses. Businesses have also continued to have good access to internal funding and to direct financing from capital markets. At the same time, the lower value of the Australian dollar over the past year has been providing a strong boost to the export sector. These developments are analysed in more detail below. ", " By August 2000, the nominal cash rate had increased by 1½ percentage points since the start of the recent series of policy tightenings, to 6¼ per cent, a level marginally above its average during the <span class=\"no-wrap\">low-inflation</span> period <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 40)</span>. Because the variation in core inflation during this period was relatively small, conducting the analysis in terms of the real interest rate makes little difference to that <span class=\"no-wrap\">conclusion (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> for a more detailed analysis)</span>. ", " While the cash rate is the interest rate in which the stance of policy is expressed, the more relevant rates for judging the impact on the economy are the rates that borrowers pay financial intermediaries. As set out in more detail in Box B, the conclusion that recent levels of real interest rates have not been particularly high is stronger if the comparison is made using intermediaries' interest rates. The sharp compression in banks' interest margins over the past five years or so has meant that the December quarter level of mortgage rates, for example, was noticeably below its average for the low-inflation period, in both nominal and real terms. Mortgage rates at end 2000 were also at a lower level than at the cyclical low reached after the early 1990s recession. As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’, interest rates on various fixed-rate loans have fallen quite significantly in recent months reflecting declines in rates in capital markets. ", " Comparing the situation with the US, a couple of important differences are worth noting. The peak in the Federal funds rate in this latest cycle (6.5 per cent) was higher than that reached in the 1994/95 tightening (6 per cent), whereas in Australia the most recent peak in the cash rate was well below the mid 1990s peak <span class=\"no-wrap\">(6.25 per cent</span> vs <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.5 per cent)</span>. A similar conclusion would apply if the comparison had been made using real rates of interest. Tables 8 and 9 give more details of Australian and US interest rates. ", " Another measure of the tightness or looseness of domestic financial conditions is the shape of the yield curve – specifically, the relationship between short-term rates, which are set by the authorities, and long-term rates, which are determined in the market. If short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, this is sometimes taken to indicate that monetary conditions are relatively tight. ", " Such a situation has developed in Australia over the past few months. Before the recent easing, yields on 10-year bonds had fallen to 5.25 per cent, 100 basis points below the then cash rate (Graph 41). This was the first inversion of the yield curve in Australia since the late 1980s, although that was much greater in magnitude and was caused by a very sharp rise in the cash rate, whereas the latest episode mainly reflects falling long yields. The latest episode is more like the situation in 1998, when long yields also fell sharply as markets became pessimistic about the economic outlook (although subsequent events proved those concerns to be unfounded). ", " Since the mid 1990s, credit has grown at a solid rate, ranging between about 8 per cent and <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 42)</span>. Growth accelerated toward the top of this range in the first half of 2000, partly due to the forthcoming introduction of the GST, which saw housing lending, in particular, rise strongly. Since then, it has slowed, but the current rate of 8¼ per cent (on a six-month annualised basis) remains within the range in which it fluctuated during the strong economic expansion over the second half of the 1990s, and much higher than it was in the recession of the early 1990s, when credit growth was negative. ", " Households continue to borrow at a faster rate than businesses, with housing credit rising at an annual rate of about 11 per cent in the six months to December, and growth in personal credit around 13 per cent over the same period. Growth of business credit has slowed noticeably to about 5 per cent (annual rate) in the six months to December. While there is likely to be some element of cyclical slowdown here, the slowing in borrowing by businesses from intermediaries also seems to reflect high levels of internal funding, as profits remain high, as well as the continuing recourse to direct raisings in capital markets (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’ for further details). ", " Credit, broadly speaking, is a measure of assets that intermediaries hold on their balance sheets. The monetary aggregates are a measure of domestic liabilities used by intermediaries to fund credit provided to businesses and households. Prior to deregulation, credit and the monetary aggregates used to move similarly, being the opposite sides of intermediaries' balance sheets. But, in recent years, periods of divergent growth have been common as intermediaries found new ways to fund themselves. Over the past four years, the monetary aggregates have been extremely volatile. Recently, the monetary aggregates have slowed sharply (Graph 43). In the six months to December, for example, broad money grew at an annual rate of about 1½ per cent. A gap between the growth of credit and broad money has been evident since 1997 and reflects switching by intermediaries from domestic deposit funding (which is counted in the monetary aggregates) to foreign sources of funds (which are not). ", " The pattern of funding of intermediaries' balance sheets over the past six months is summarised in Table 10. In recent months, they have relied on foreign raisings to fund almost 60 per cent of the rise in credit; about a further 10 per cent has been funded in domestic capital markets through domestic bond issues to take advantage of the low level of long-term interest rates. (Issues of bonds by banks are also excluded from monetary aggregates.) Only about a third of new funding in the second half of 2000 came from banks' traditional source of funds, namely raising deposits in domestic markets. The result has been that recent growth in domestic deposit liabilities has fallen by noticeably more than the overall level of financing activity in the economy, of which credit is the best measure. ", " As discussed in detail in the chapter on ‘International and Foreign Exchange Markets’, the Australian dollar fell sharply during 2000, both against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms. Since inflation rates in Australia and in most major trading partners have remained comparably low in recent years, these movements in nominal exchange rates also translate into measures of real exchange rates, which adjust for differences in inflation rates across countries. Graph 44 shows a measure of the real trade-weighted index of the Australian dollar obtained by adjusting the component bilateral rates for relative movements in consumer prices. This index fell by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 per cent</span> over the year to the December quarter, in line with the movement of the nominal TWI. ", " While it is not possible to establish any exact benchmark for evaluating the influence of the exchange rate on the economy, recent levels of the real exchange rate have been clearly at the low end of historical experience, and therefore exerted an overall expansionary impact. The real TWI in the December quarter was 15 per cent below its 1990s average, and slightly lower than previous quarterly troughs recorded in 1986 and 1995. The appreciation in the nominal exchange rate in recent weeks will have reversed only a small part of this stimulus. ", " For some time following the tightening of monetary policy early in August, market participants continued to expect further monetary tightening. Reflecting this, the yield on 90-day bills rose to a peak of 6.65 per cent in late September (Graph 45). These market expectations subsequently gradually subsided, but bill yields remained above the cash rate through to end November. ", " In mid December, the situation began to change. There was growing concern about instability in US asset markets and the possibility of a slowing in the US economy. Markets in the US began to expect that the Fed would ease interest rates by its late January meeting. While commentators drew a sharp distinction between Australian and US developments, the building expectations of a US easing did start to have some impact on local markets. By late December, short-term yields in Australia had moved a little below the cash rate, but this process gathered momentum after the cut in the US Fed funds rate early in January and, again, after the favourable domestic inflation news later in the month. By early February, financial markets had largely anticipated the cut in the cash rate of 0.5 of a percentage point (to 5.75 per cent) on 7 February, so that short-term yields showed little further change. ", " Long-term market yields in Australia have also moved sharply lower in recent months. They had traded within a range of 6 and 6¼ per cent for much of the second half of last year. From mid November, however, they began to fall, mainly, at first, on the back of the fall in yields in the US. Bond yields in Australia continued to fall in January, however, even though they rose from their lows in the US after the Fed's move. By early February, the yield on Australian 10-year bonds had moved down to about 5.25 per cent, its lowest level since April 1999, when yields were rising from the historical lows associated with the near collapse of the hedge fund LTCM (Graph 46). ", " Over the past few years, Australian bond yields have shown a very high correlation with US yields, more so than the correlation of short-term interest rates in the two countries. It is therefore hard to know the extent to which the recent fall in domestic bond yields is simply a reflection of US developments. More generally though, the fall in bond yields in Australia is set against a background of falling inflation expectations. ", " The differential between Australian and US 10-year bonds has remained within a tight range in recent months, between zero and 50 basis points (Graph 47). In early February, this differential was about 15 basis points, at the low end of the recent range and very low by historical standards. ", " Interest rates on the full range of variable-rate loans to households and businesses remained largely unchanged between the adjustments that followed the last increase in the cash rate in August 2000 and the reduction of <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 basis points</span> in the cash rate in February 2001 (Graph 48). (There were, however, cuts in banks' ‘honeymoon’ mortgage rates of between 0.5 and 1.0 percentage point.) ", " On the same day that policy was eased in February, each of the major banks (and some other lenders) announced that they would cut their standard home loan rates by the full 50 basis points. The average variable-rate mortgage rate is now 7.55 per cent. ", " At the time of writing, only one bank had announced a reduction (of 50 basis points) in its variable-rate loans to businesses. ", " There have been widespread reductions in interest rates on fixed-rate loans in recent months. Since November, banks have lowered the interest rate on 3-year fixed rate mortgages by 0.8 of a percentage point to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.9 per cent</span>. ", " The comparable fixed-rate indicator for small businesses has been reduced by slightly more than housing rates recently. The drop in these rates since their peak in early 2000 has been larger for small businesses (at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.0 percentage points)</span> than for households (at <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.1 percentage points)</span> mainly because small business rates rose by more than mortgages when market interest rates were rising in 1999. The drop in small business fixed rates from the peak has kept pace with the fall (of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.9 percentage points)</span> in yields in capital markets in which term loans are funded (Graph 49). About <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> of the stock of housing loans and about <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> of small business loans are at fixed rates. ", " Funding through capital markets is becoming an important source of credit. About one-fifth of debt financing used by Australian businesses now comes from capital markets. While this proportion is a lot less than in the US (where around half of business debt financing comes from capital markets), capital market developments are nonetheless an important influence on the availability of credit to borrowers in Australia. ", " Unlike in the US, there are no signs in Australia of any tightening in access to funds from capital markets. In the December quarter, net total debt raisings amounted to $5 billion, roughly in line with the average quarterly amount raised in the first three quarters of the year. ", " Corporate bond issuance in Australia in the first half of 2000 was dominated by recently privatised utilities (such as electricity distributors and airports) whose bonds had extra credit enhancements built-in allowing them to be AAA-rated. More recently, a greater share of issuance has come from less highly-rated companies. The move down the credit risk spectrum has been accompanied by an increase in the share of issuance being shorter term (around three years) and floating rate. For the year as a whole, the distribution of raisings by credit rating of the borrower and by maturity was quite even (Table 11). ", " Interest rates on corporate debt in Australia have come down sharply in recent months, and are now down about 1.8 percentage points from a year ago. This has unwound all the earlier rise that had been associated with the tightening of monetary policy. This fall in corporate yields has been very similar to that in government yields. This reflects the fact that credit spreads in Australia, be they for high-grade or low-grade debt, have not changed much over the past year. For example, spreads on AAA-rated bonds have oscillated between 45 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">55 basis points</span> since June 2000. This stands in marked contrast to <span class=\"no-wrap\">US developments</span> (see chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’) and suggests there has been no deterioration in debt market conditions in Australia. The level of non-government yields is shown on Graph 50 while the spreads to government yields are on Graph 51. ", " With credit spreads in Australia remaining steady and those in the US rising, the interest rates paid by Australian companies are now significantly below those paid by US companies. Table 12 summarises the relevant interest rates for companies of various credit ratings. The gap for less highly-rated companies is particularly wide. ", " The one area in Australia where there has been some re-rating of risk by markets has been in the telecom sector. This has been a common experience around the world. The international deterioration began around the middle of last year after telecom companies were seen to have paid excessive amounts for so-called third generation (3G) spectrum licences. To finance the acquisition of these licences, the telecommunications sector raised large amounts of debt in corporate bond markets. The growth in that debt, combined with uncertainties about how much additional revenue 3G technology will generate, has seen the credit ratings of telecommunications firms fall and their credit spreads rise. ", " While Telstra debt has been affected by this, the deterioration in its spread has not been as marked as that for telecoms in some overseas countries (Graph 52). Telstra remains at the better end of the spectrum for credit ratings of telecommunication companies. ", " One sector where there is a particularly marked contrast between the Australian and US experience is banking. Spreads on US bank debt relative to government debt rose to over 100 basis points in late 2000 from 60 a year ago. In contrast, the spread on Australian bank debt has remained flat, averaging around <span class=\"no-wrap\">60 basis points</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 53)</span>. The gap between the spreads widened significantly around the middle of last year, with the collapse in the high-tech equity bubble, as markets became increasingly concerned about the extent to which US banks were exposed. More recently, the policy action by the Fed seems to have calmed markets and US spreads have fallen somewhat. ", " Differences in market assessments of Australian and US banks can also be seen in equity markets, as shown in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 54</span>. Share prices of Australian banks are at historical highs but those of US banks are still well down on their level of 1998. ", " The recent falls that have characterised US share markets have not been reflected in the Australian market. The ASX 200 index has shown little net change since end September whereas the broad-based US indices have shown net falls of around 9 per cent in this period. While share prices in most other developed countries have also held up better than the US market recently, the Australian market is the only one that remains close to its peak. ", " The recent better performance of the Australian market has allowed it to narrow the gap to the US market that had opened over the past three years (Graph 55). If the comparison is extended back to the start of 1995, of course, the increase in the US share market greatly exceeds that in Australia (the respective increases being around 175 per cent and 70 per cent). ", " The main sector accounting for the recent relative strength of the Australian market is the banking sector, where share prices have risen by 13 per cent over the past four months. In addition, the resource sector has also been comparatively strong, rising by 5 per cent. ", " The pure technology sector in Australia has seen a fall in share prices similar to that in the NASDAQ, but this is only a very small part of the Australian index. ", " Share market valuations remain above average in Australia, though less so than in the US. The commonly used measure of share market valuations – the price-earnings ratio – rose in Australia from around 15 in early 1995 to 29 in mid 2000. Since then, it has fallen back to 21 (Graph 56). This fall has come about not from falls in share prices, as in some other countries, but from rising profits (including the recovery in BHP's and other mining companies' profitability). The long-run average price-earnings ratio in Australia is about 15. As noted earlier, the price-earnings ratio for broad US share indices is currently 25, compared with a long-run average of 16. ", " Initial public offerings in Australia slowed in the December quarter 2000 but remain in line with the experience of recent years (Graph 57). The Australian market had not experienced the earlier surge seen in the US, nor has the recent slowing been as marked. ", " The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.3 per cent in the December quarter, to be 5.8 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 58). The December quarter outcome was lower than had generally been expected, and was the result of low outcomes across a wide range of components. Year-ended growth in the CPI and the standard measures of underlying inflation continue to reflect the impact of the new tax system on prices, the bulk of which occurred in the September quarter (Table 13). Higher petrol prices have also significantly boosted the headline CPI. While estimates of the tax effects are subject to considerable uncertainty, the range of available estimates are consistent with underlying inflation (excluding the first-round effects of tax changes and petrol prices) being around 2 per cent over the year to the December quarter 2000. ", " Prior to the introduction of the new tax system, it was expected that the tax changes would result in a large increase in the CPI in the September quarter, followed by low increases in subsequent quarters as the removal of embedded wholesale sales taxes placed downward pressure on retail prices. In the event, the increase in the CPI over the September and December quarters together was smaller than expected. There are several possible interpretations of this outcome. It is possible that businesses have absorbed some of the tax increase into their profit margins, and are still determining whether to pass these increases on to consumers. In a low-inflation environment, it may take some time for producers to assess the appropriate level of their prices following a widespread change in relative prices, as brought about by reforms such as these. It is also possible that the original estimates of the long-run tax effects were too high. It was always recognised that, given the nature of the tax changes, it was not possible to estimate the magnitude or timing of the net tax effects with precision. Finally, underlying inflation may have been running at a lower rate than had earlier been assessed. All of these factors may be at play to some degree, and it could be another quarter or two before a clearer reading on underlying inflation becomes available. ", " A couple of non-tax-related factors that had been boosting inflation over the past year abated in the December quarter. Petrol prices continued to contribute to the increase in the CPI, although the 1.3 per cent increase in petrol prices recorded in the December quarter was markedly lower than the increases recorded in the previous few quarters. Over the year to December, the petrol price rose by 24.5 per cent, contributing 1 percentage point to the year-ended increase in the CPI. Over the course of the December quarter, however, petrol prices eased as world oil prices fell and the exchange rate appreciated. Assuming oil prices and the exchange rate remain around current levels, the March quarter CPI is likely to record a fall in petrol prices for the first time since early 1999. Increases in house purchase costs, which have made significant contributions to inflation over the last couple of years, also eased in the December quarter as the housing sector weakened. The house purchase component of the CPI increased by just 0.2 per cent in the December quarter, after having increased by nearly 14 per cent over the year to the September quarter (including tax effects). ", " The December quarter CPI showed little effect of the depreciation of the exchange rate over the previous year. In import-weighted terms, the exchange rate depreciated by around 11 per cent over the year to the December quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 59)</span>. Although the lower exchange rate was passed rapidly through to producer and wholesale prices (as discussed further below), as well as retail petrol prices, the pass-through to other consumer prices has been more difficult to detect. Excluding petrol, tradeable prices were flat in the December quarter and increased by 1.9 per cent over the year (including the effect of the tax changes). Imported motor vehicle prices fell by 1 per cent in the December quarter, and prices of other items with a high import content, namely clothing, audio, visual and computing equipment and appliances, either fell or increased very modestly in the quarter. Prices for these goods have either fallen or increased at relatively low rates over the past year. ", " The lack of pass-through of the lower exchange rate to consumer prices is suggestive of a compression of margins in the retail sector, and is thus consistent with evidence of weaker profits in retailing (as discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’). This may reflect concerns about the strength of domestic demand or competitive pressures, and it could also reflect businesses' preferences only to pass through exchange rate changes that are expected to be long lasting. Although there remains the likelihood that the lower exchange rate will be reflected in consumer prices in coming quarters, the appreciation of the exchange rate in the early part of 2001 may have relieved this pressure a little, facilitating a rebuilding of retail margins without the need for as much adjustment of retail prices. ", " Producer prices have increased sharply over the past year, driven by rising world commodity prices, particularly for mineral fuels and basic metal products, and the depreciation of the exchange rate. In contrast to the outcomes for consumer prices, producer prices have increased more rapidly than generally expected. The most rapid increases have been evident at the earlier stages of production, with the impact of raw materials prices on final-stage prices diluted by other factors, such as capital costs, labour costs and profit margins, which tend to be less volatile than materials costs (Table 14). ", " Final producer prices (excluding exports) increased by 1.5 per cent in the December quarter to be 5.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Substantial increases were recorded in import prices across all industries, largely as a result of the depreciation of the exchange rate. Domestic price rises were more moderate. The final-stage index for consumption goods has moved in line with the broader index, rising by 5.4 per cent over the year. While this index most closely parallels the composition of the CPI, it places a much higher weight on goods than does the CPI and is also measured at basic prices rather than retail prices, that is prior to the imposition of indirect taxes, transport costs and trade margins. ", " Sharp rises in the cost of raw materials have driven the rapid price rises at earlier stages of production. Rises in manufacturing input prices of around 26 per cent over the past 18 months have, in turn, resulted in higher growth in manufacturing output prices, which increased by 2.5 per cent in the December quarter and have increased by 12 per cent since mid 1999. The largest contributors to the overall increase have continued to be petroleum and coal products and basic metal products, although the December quarter increase was more broadly based. Excluding these two items, manufactured output prices increased by 1.3 per cent in the December quarter. The effect of the lower value of the currency on the cost of capital goods is evident, with the price of imported machinery rising strongly in the December quarter. ", " These rising inflation pressures have been partially offset by modest inflation in most non-tradeable sectors. The available data for the service sector suggest that inflation has generally remained subdued, although there have been sharp rises in prices for international transport and the cost of property services. Increases in construction costs have moderated. Abstracting from the effect of removing the WST from building materials prices, price increases for building materials used in housing construction have slowed sharply in conjunction with the downturn in the residential construction sector, while the price of non-residential construction materials continues to rise at a modest pace. ", " The sharp rise in producer prices, particularly for tradeable goods, suggests some upstream pressure on consumer prices in coming quarters, but there are indications that producer price inflation may have passed its peak. Abstracting from the imported components, the producer price data suggest that prices of domestically produced items have risen only modestly over the past two quarters, and the recent appreciation of the currency should also help to lessen the upstream price pressures. ", " The recent business surveys provide a broadly consistent picture; they report that growth in product prices has increased sharply over the past year but some moderation is likely in the period ahead. The economy-wide NAB survey has recorded a clear step-up in the rate at which firms expect to increase final product prices, and expectations are for similar increases in the March quarter to the increases recorded in the preceding two quarters <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 60)</span>. Retailers expect higher price rises, which the survey attributes to an intention to reverse the recent compression in margins. The ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers recorded a similarly marked step-up in the net balance of firms increasing their prices over the past year. Purchase costs, which have risen sharply in recent quarters, are expected to increase at a more moderate pace in the March quarter, according to both surveys. ", " The broad range of wage indicators suggests that wages growth has begun to edge higher after a period of more moderate outcomes. The wage cost index (WCI) rose by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.1 per cent</span> over the year, up from the year-ended rate of 2.8 per cent in the previous quarter (Graph 61). While the quarterly rise in the WCI was the equal largest in the three years since the inception of the survey, it may be seasonal: outcomes in the September quarter have, to date, been larger than in other quarters (the data are not seasonally adjusted). ", " The size of wage increases provided by new federal enterprise agreements picked up in the September quarter to an average annualised rate of 4.1 per cent, from 3.4 per cent in the June quarter (Table 15). However, the extent of this pick-up was boosted by a couple of large public-sector agreements that were affected by significant renegotiation lags, resulting in the recorded wage increases being higher than would otherwise have been the case. The average annual wage increase in private-sector agreements, which may provide a better guide to emerging wages pressure, has risen from 3.5 per cent to 3.9 per cent over the past year. Further increases in this series may occur in the next couple of quarters, as annualised wage increases of between 4 and 4½ per cent contained in recent agreements reached in the Victorian manufacturing sector are included in the series. ", " In contrast to the moderate increases shown in other wage measures, average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) have risen very rapidly in recent quarters, to be 6.1 per cent higher over the year to August 2000 compared with a year-ended growth rate of 2.1 per cent recorded a year earlier. Notwithstanding the tightening of labour market conditions during 2000, the extent of the pick-up in wages growth recorded by AWOTE seems to be overstated. It may partly represent a correction for the surprising weakness that was evident in this measure of wages in the latter half of 1999. AWOTE is a measure of the wage bill per employee and is therefore affected by changes in the underlying composition of employment. Measures of labour costs reported in the national accounts, which are also derived from a wage bill, have shown a much smaller acceleration from a little below 2½ per cent in late 1999 to just below 3½ per cent over the year to the September quarter 2000. If non-wage costs are excluded, the pick-up in growth is only slight. ", " The Mercer Cullen Egan Dell (MCED) salary review for the December quarter reported that the base salary of executives grew by 4.8 per cent over the course of 2000, up slightly from the average rate of 4.6 per cent recorded in the preceding four quarters. The base salary component does not include any bonuses or returns from participation in corporate share schemes. Data from the MCED survey suggest that the growth of non-executive pay has remained steady at a little over 4 per cent (Graph 62). ", " The latest business surveys suggest that there is little further upward pressure on wages growth. The December quarter ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported a sharp decline in the net balance of firms finding it more difficult to find labour. The broader NAB survey reported that the percentage of firms which cite the availability of suitable labour as a constraint on current output growth has eased from the high levels recorded in late 1999. ", " One uncertainty in the wages outlook has been the potential for additional wage increases triggered by GST-related clauses contained in some enterprise agreements. In recent quarters the proportion of private-sector employees covered by GST-related clauses has risen, although it remains relatively low. This increase has been largely driven by a rise in the number of clauses that seek to reopen wage negotiations should inflation exceed expectations or some defined benchmark, rather than clauses providing full or partial indexing of wages to the CPI. The lower-than-expected CPI outcomes since the introduction of the tax changes have, however, reduced the likelihood of significant extra wage claims being generated by this mechanism. ", " The Safety Net Review of award wages is currently being undertaken by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC). The AIRC will consider an application by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to increase award rates of pay from the federal minimum wage <span class=\"no-wrap\">($400.40 per week)</span> up to $492.20 by $28 per week, and by 5.7 per cent for award rates above this. A decision is expected in late April. ", " Most broad measures of inflation expectations have fallen in recent months, suggesting that factors such as the introduction of the GST, higher oil prices and the lower exchange rate are more likely to have a temporary effect on the inflation rate than add to ongoing inflation pressures. ", " Consumers' expectations of inflation, as surveyed by the Melbourne Institute, have declined since the introduction of the tax changes in mid 2000, to around the level prevailing in 1998 (Graph 63). The median expectation of inflation over the next year has fallen from a peak of over 8 per cent in May 2000 to 3.9 per cent in January 2001, its lowest level in two years. The latest decline is likely to have been influenced by the lower petrol prices prevailing when the survey was taken in mid January. ", " Financial market economists revised down their inflation forecasts following the unexpectedly low December quarter 2000 CPI outcome. The median inflation forecast of market economists surveyed by the Bank decreased by around ½ of one percentage point for both the current financial year and the next. For the year to June 2001, inflation is forecast to be 5 per cent in headline terms and 2.3 per cent excluding tax effects, and for the year to June 2002, inflation is forecast to be 2 per cent (Table 16). The median estimate of the first-year tax effect is <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span>, and the majority of respondents expect taxes to have little effect on inflation over the following year. Most respondents expect further appreciation of the exchange rate and falls in oil prices over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">next 18 months</span>. ", " The inflation forecasts of trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), have been lowered even more sharply. Inflation is now expected to be at least 1 percentage point lower, in both this year and the next, than was forecast three months ago. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of financial market participants, measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, have also fallen. The ¾ of a percentage point fall in nominal bond yields since October, which outstripped the fall in indexed bond yields, is similar to the sharp scaling-back of inflation expectations in global bond markets over the period. These bond yields imply that long-term inflation expectations are currently around 2¼ per cent, down from around 3¾ per cent a year ago, but a little above the low levels recorded in 1998. ", " Medium-term inflation expectations of businesses, in contrast to the other measures, have been broadly unchanged over the past six months and remain well above the level prevailing a couple of years ago. The December quarter NAB survey indicated that around 60 per cent of firms expect inflation to average 3–4 per cent over the next five years, up from 50 per cent in early 1999, and a little over 25 per cent of firms expect inflation to be less than 3 per cent, down from over 40 per cent in early 1999. The difference between this and other measures of inflation expectations may reflect the higher weight that businesses place on developments in producer prices and purchase costs when forming their expectations. ", " It has been difficult to gauge the strength of underlying price pressures in recent quarters. Measures of inflation have been significantly affected by the recent indirect tax changes, most of which occurred in the September quarter 2000. The size and timing of these effects on prices have been difficult to determine with confidence. The introduction of the new tax system also contributed to heightened levels of activity in some sectors earlier in the year, which had some temporary inflationary consequences. Excluding the estimated effects of the tax changes and other temporary factors, such as higher oil prices, the Bank's assessment is that inflation has probably been running at around 2 per cent over the past year. ", " Inflation has for some time been expected to increase in underlying terms, reflecting the buoyant conditions in the domestic economy that prevailed up to the middle of 2000 as well as some sharp increases in raw materials costs and import prices over the past year. Recent developments suggest that demand factors are unlikely to place as much upward pressure on inflation as had been expected a few months ago. After growing at an average rate of around 4¾ per cent over the past three years, the economy now seems likely to experience a period of lower growth, partly reflecting the softer outlook for the world economy. ", " Rising labour costs also appear to pose less of a risk to the inflation outlook than previously seemed likely. Our assessment is that wages growth has picked up a little in recent periods. With conditions in the labour market having eased in recent months, and consumers' inflation expectations declining to their lowest level in two years, however, the likely extent of further acceleration in wages is limited. The lower-than-expected outcomes for inflation in the second half of 2000 also make it less likely that CPI or GST-related clauses in wage agreements will be triggered. ", " The recent strong growth in producer and wholesale prices, however, is still expected to generate some upward pressure on inflation in the near term. The sharply lower exchange rate, coupled with higher global commodity prices over the past year, have contributed to rapid increases in both materials costs and the prices of imported goods recorded at the docks. Other than for petrol, however, these price increases are yet to have a discernible impact on retail prices. The prices of items with a large import component have been relatively subdued at the retail level, as have been the prices of tradeable items more generally. Past experience has been that such upstream price pressures typically take some time to flow through to retail prices, and if they are spread over a long enough period of time they may have little perceptible effect on inflation outcomes. The risk remains, however, that the pass-through of these cost increases could boost inflation noticeably in the next few quarters, although the appreciation of the exchange rate in the early part of 2001 could act to alleviate some of this pressure. ", " Despite the near-term price pressures likely to be associated with import prices and materials costs, the longer-term outlook for inflation appears to be more secure than it did a few months ago. Inflation expectations on the part of financial market participants and consumers have eased further in recent months, as the near-term outlook for activity has softened and the new tax system has been bedded down. Compared with three months ago, the risk that the price spike associated with the introduction of the GST would lead to a step-up in ongoing inflation has thus receded considerably. These lower inflation expectations suggest that should a temporary increase in inflation occur, it is less likely to result in a persistent inflation problem than would have been the case a quarter or two ago. In addition, it should be noted that petrol prices are unlikely to contribute to headline inflation in the period ahead in the way that they have done over the past year. Petrol prices have declined in recent months and are likely to subtract from the CPI in the March quarter. ", " Overall, the Bank's assessment is that inflation, abstracting from the temporary effects of the tax changes and movements in oil prices, is likely to increase only slightly in the near term and will remain well within the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> target during the next couple of years. On a year-ended basis, headline CPI inflation will continue to be held up by the net effects of the new tax system until the middle of 2001. It is then expected to fall a little below underlying measures of inflation, reflecting an assumed further easing in world oil prices and the scheduled removal of some additional indirect taxes. ", " This outlook is based on the standard technical assumption that the exchange rate remains around recent levels, an assumption that is clearly subject to uncertainties in both directions. Also uncertain is the speed at which the upstream cost and price increases that have already occurred will feed through to retail prices. It is possible that a more significant pass-through of these increases will occur than is currently assumed. An important additional source of uncertainty concerns the outlook for growth in the global economy. Recent assessments of likely growth in the world economy have shifted noticeably lower, and there remain further downside risks in that area, although recent monetary policy actions will obviously be working to offset those risks. If there were a significant further weakening in the global economy, it would probably entail somewhat lower inflation prospects both in Australia and abroad. ", " Since 1 July 2000, the lag between when a company earns income and when it pays tax on that income has been substantially reduced. Under the new tax system, companies will pay most of their company tax instalments in the financial year in which the liability is incurred. This contrasts with the previous system in which companies (unlike individuals) paid much of their tax after the year in which income was earned. The switch to the new system raises the possibility of larger tax payments this financial year as companies pay tax both on income earned in 1999/2000 (under the old tax arrangements) and income earned in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2000/01</span> (under the new tax arrangements). However, deferral arrangements reduce this burden markedly in 2000/01 by allowing payments to be spread over a number of years. The deferral arrangements vary according to the amount of tax paid by a company.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " Under the old tax arrangements, large tax companies (those that pay more than $300,000 annually) paid tax in four quarterly instalments: the first two instalments fell due in March and June of the relevant fiscal year, with the remaining instalments in September and December of the next fiscal year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph A1</span>, top panel). Under the new arrangements, companies pay corporate tax mainly in the year in which it is accrued: tax is based on quarterly income and is paid three weeks after the end of the quarter (Graph A1, middle panel). ", " In the absence of the deferral arrangements, a large company would have had to pay about 125 per cent of its normal annual tax bill in 2000/01 – 50 per cent (two instalments) of its annual tax bill for 1999/2000 profits, as well as 75 per cent of the tax bill incurred in 2000/01. Under the deferral arrangements, companies can defer most of the fourth instalment on 1999/2000 profits and pay it in equal quarterly instalments over the next 2½ years. A company making full use of the deferral provisions might expect to pay about an extra 10 per cent of its normal tax bill in 2000/01. ", " Previously, medium tax companies (companies that pay between $8,000 and $300,000 tax per year) paid the first quarterly tax instalment in the June quarter of the relevant fiscal year (a quarter later than large companies), with the subsequent three quarterly instalments paid in the following financial year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph A2</span>, top panel). The new arrangements bring this tax payment schedule forward by about seven months. However, the deferral arrangements allow companies to defer the third instalment on <span class=\"no-wrap\">1999/2000</span> profits and most of the fourth instalment, with these payments to be made over the next five years. As a result, the total tax bill for a medium-sized company in 2000/01 will be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> more than in a normal year. ", " Small tax companies (companies that pay less than $8,000 per year) represent over 80 per cent of the number of corporate taxpayers, although they account for only 3 per cent of corporate tax collected. Under the old arrangements, these companies made one annual tax payment in December in the fiscal year following that in which profits were earned (Graph A3, top panel). The new arrangements require quarterly tax payments for small tax companies that are registered for the GST. (Small tax companies that are not registered for the GST can continue to make annual payments.) Without the deferral arrangements, small companies would have been required to pay, during the 2000/01 fiscal year, all of the tax on profit earned in <span class=\"no-wrap\">1999/2000</span>, plus three quarterly instalments based on 2000/01 profits. Small tax companies have been permitted to defer all of the tax on profit earned in 1999/2000 which was due in December 2000, and pay it in quarterly instalments over five years from April 2001. A company which fully used the deferral provisions would pay around 20 per cent less tax in 2000/01 than in a normal year. ", " Interest rates are often analysed in real, or net of inflation, terms. This takes account of the fact that part of the nominal interest that borrowers agree to pay to lenders represents compensation for anticipated inflation. The remaining ‘real’ component better reflects the economic cost of borrowing and the return to lending. ", " There are a number of measurement issues that arise in calculating real interest rates. There is no unique measure of this concept because interest rates vary depending on such factors as the maturity and risk of the loan or asset. Another important issue is that measures of real interest rates should ideally be constructed from <em>expected</em> inflation over the life of the loan or asset. In practice, however, inflation expectations are not readily observable, and they have to be proxied either by survey-based measures or by an appropriate indicator of the current actual inflation rate. For these reasons it is important to look at a range of measures when assessing the overall impact of real interest rates on incentives to borrow and invest. ", " Graph B1 shows two measures of the real cash rate. The first is calculated using a measure of current inflation (the weighted median inflation rate<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> over the year to the time the cash rate is observed) and the second using a measure of expected inflation (the Melbourne Institute survey of households' inflation expectations). The real cash rate calculated on the second basis is consistently the lower of the two, because the survey measure of consumers' inflation expectations has typically exceeded actual inflation. ", " The real cash rate measured using current inflation rose by around 1¾ percentage points from the trough at the end of 1999 to the December quarter 2000. This measure implied a real cash rate of just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> prior to the February policy easing, only slightly above its average for the low-inflation period <span class=\"no-wrap\">since 1992</span>. The second of the two measures has shown a somewhat different pattern over the past year. It declined sharply during 1999 and into the early part of 2000, reflecting the temporary upward spike in consumers' expectations of inflation prior to the introduction of the GST. Subsequently, as inflation expectations have returned to more normal levels, the implied real cash rate has moved back up. Nevertheless, this measure too rose to a level only marginally above its average for the period since 1992. Both these measures of the real cash rate remain well below the levels reached in the mid 1990s tightening phase of monetary policy, which in turn were significantly below the peaks reached in the late 1980s. ", " Graph B2 shows real interest rates of financial intermediaries for housing and small business loans, calculated using current inflation rates (corresponding to the first of the two methods described above). While broadly tracking movements in cash rates in the short term, these indicator rates have undergone a significant downward shift relative to cash rates in the course of the past decade, reflecting the competitive pressures that have compressed intermediaries' net interest margins over that period. Hence, while intermediaries' real indicator rates for these types of loans have increased during the past year in line with the cash rate, they are still relatively low in historical terms. Before the February easing, real housing loan rates were just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span>, about half a percentage point below the average levels over the low inflation period since 1992, and lower than they were at their cyclical trough in the early 1990s. The compression of margins on business indicator rates has not been quite as pronounced as has been the case for housing loans in that period, but these rates also were slightly below their cyclical average in real terms in December.

The United States economy has continued its remarkable combination of strong growth and very subdued inflation. Economies in the euro area slowed late last year, affected by weakness in export markets, but are now seeing a solid expansion in domestic demand, which offers the prospect of stronger output growth before long. In Japan, the budgetary stimulus is acting to support economic activity, which appears to have reached a bottom during the second half of 1998. The fledgling recoveries in a number of Asian countries have continued, and in the case of Korea, the pick-up in activity over the past six to nine months has been unexpectedly strong. As a result of these developments, most forecasts of global growth are now being revised up, for the first time in two years. ", " These developments have been assisted by much more settled conditions in international financial markets. Last year, global markets were affected by a series of financial shocks, including the east Asian currency and banking crises, the Russian debt moratorium, and the problems of Long-Term Capital Management. The resulting stresses raised concerns about the functioning of financial markets and intermediaries even in the major countries, and prompted policy responses by the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks. During 1999, in contrast, financial markets have been much steadier. Capital flows have resumed to many of the countries at the centre of the Asian crisis, prompting a sharp pick-up in share prices, strengthening currencies and permitting falls in <span class=\"no-wrap\">interest rates</span>. Concerns about impairment of the credit process have receded, and share markets in developed countries have reached new highs, despite a slight tightening of US monetary policy. Australian financial markets have seen similar trends. There has been some rise in market interest rates on both short-term and long-term securities, as market participants, particularly those offshore, speculated that the Reserve Bank might follow its US counterpart in tightening monetary policy. There has also been continued strength in the share market, particularly in resource stocks, and some rise in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar. ", " The international trends offer the prospect that the external environment faced by Australian producers will gradually improve over the next couple of years. There is, nonetheless, some distance to go yet. While some commodity prices have risen in response to the expectation of stronger world growth, those most important for Australian exporters remain very weak. Moreover, while signs of better performance in Europe and Japan are welcome, it is likely that the world economy will need to cope with a slowdown in the United States at some stage in the next year. It is as yet uncertain whether private demand in Japan will gather enough strength to sustain growth in the economy. Nor should the progress in the east Asian economies obscure the fact that a long and arduous process of repairing and reforming financial and corporate structures remains to be completed. Hence the possibility of further setbacks cannot be entirely discounted. ", " Assuming the current gradual trend towards improved international conditions continues, benefits will in due course flow through for Australia. In the meantime, the effects of the decline in exports over the past year will be acting as a drag on Australian producers. The most visible current manifestation of this is in the current account deficit, but the apparent downward revisions to investment intentions are also partly attributable to the same forces. It still, therefore, seems likely that a period of slower economic growth in Australia will be observed in the period ahead, although it must be admitted that the weaker data for capital spending intentions are, at this point, the only clear evidence for this. ", " The risks of a larger or more protracted slowdown appear, however, to have lessened over the past six months. As of the March quarter, the economy was still recording growth in excess of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>, with strong domestic demand, particularly household consumption spending, making up for weakness in export performance. The current expansion, now entering its ninth year, is the longest since the 1960s. This has been associated with a decline in the rate of unemployment of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 percentage</span> points since its peak – not quite as fast as in the 1980s upswing, but with much better prospects that it can be sustained. ", " Inflation remains quite low, in Australia as elsewhere. The CPI recorded an increase of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.1 per cent</span> over the most recent 12 months. This result was affected by the changes to health insurance arrangements; excluding this impact, the rise was about <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.5 per cent</span>. A variety of ‘underlying’ measures of inflation put it between 1½ and <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, up a little from its low point in late 1997. The Bank's forecast is that inflation on a CPI basis will gradually increase, rising a little above 2 per cent during the first half of 2000. The recent rise in international oil prices, assumed in this forecast to persist, is one factor pushing inflation up. On an ‘underlying’ basis, inflation will likely remain at about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> through the first half of next year. ", " Barring further external shocks, the main economic event now on the horizon in Australia is the introduction of the tax reform package in July 2000. This will involve a one-time shift in the price level, accompanied by income tax cuts which, on average, more than offset any reduction in real income, such that there is a net fiscal expansion. The expected modest slowdown in the economy over the next few quarters should help to absorb this particular event. The fact that inflation is likely still to be quite low immediately before the GST's introduction will also assist. ", " The Bank will abstract from the one-time price level change associated with the GST, for the purposes of assessing the ongoing rate of inflation. It is, of course, important that those involved in wage and price decisions do the same. Prospects for that appear, at the present juncture at least, to be good, given the high degree of competitive pressure which characterises goods markets. The magnitude of the GST-induced price level change and the extent to which wage decisions are affected will need to be kept under close review over the coming <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 months</span>. ", " The current trend in inflation, and its likely course over the next year to 18 months (abstracting from impact effects of the GST and assuming existing policy settings), appears, at present, to be consistent with achieving the inflation target on a medium-term basis. The Bank has, accordingly, seen no need to make any adjustments to interest rates since the change made last December. ", " The United States economy has largely maintained its momentum over the first half of 1999 with little indication of more than a gradual slowdown. Despite growth faster than most estimates of potential for a sustained period and the continued tightness of the labour market, there are still few signs of inflationary pressure. ", " Real GDP expanded at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span> in the first half of 1999 (Table 1). Growth in domestic final demand ran at <span class=\"no-wrap\">5½ per cent</span> per annum over the same period. The main driving force continues to be consumption spending, which has been underpinned by solid employment growth, strong consumer confidence and rising household wealth. As has been the case for several years, growth in consumption has outpaced that in disposable income, leading, in recent quarters, to a negative household saving rate (as recorded by the national accounts). Consumers have, in part, financed their spending by realising some of the capital gains from their share holdings, or by borrowing against them. ", " Reflecting strong growth in the US relative to most of the rest of the world, the US trade balance has declined over the past year and a half, leading to a current account deficit of just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> of GDP in the March quarter. This is likely to have widened further in the June quarter, although the decline in net exports was less than in the March quarter, as export volumes rose. The latter has contributed to the mild recovery in the manufacturing sector over recent months. ", " Inflation remains subdued, despite a temporary spike in April resulting from higher world oil prices. The core inflation rate, at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span> in the year to June, is close to the lowest so far this cycle. This outcome can largely be attributed to the slowdown in wages growth that occurred unexpectedly last year, combined with above average productivity growth. The continuation of such favourable outcomes cannot be counted on with the unemployment rate remaining at historic lows (Graph 1). ", " The Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy in June. As noted in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#financial-markets\">Financial Markets</a>’, this decision reflected an easing of concerns about the possible spillover of adverse developments in international markets to the US financial system. With the US economy continuing to grow strongly, the earlier lower level of interest rates was judged no longer to be necessary. ", " The continued strength of the US economy has benefited the Canadian economy, which grew at an annualised rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4½ per cent</span> over the six months to March. Core measures of inflation, which averaged close to <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> in 1998, have moved up by around half a percentage point over recent months. ", " In Latin America, although economic activity has generally been weak, surprisingly stable economic conditions have prevailed since Brazil's exchange rate devaluation in January. In Brazil, output has been stronger than most had expected and inflation lower. The government has announced the adoption of an inflation-targeting regime for the central bank, which aims for an inflation rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> this year, falling to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> by 2001. Output in Argentina has been weaker than in Brazil, as interest rates have remained reasonably high to maintain the exchange rate peg to the US dollar, and it has not had the expansionary effect of a lower exchange rate. With its economy more closely tied to that of the United States than either Argentina's or Brazil's, Mexico grew by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> last year, despite a slowing in the second half of the year as a result of high interest rates during the international financial crisis and also low oil prices. With these strains easing and continued strong growth in the United States, Mexico should experience reasonably robust growth this year. ", " The Japanese economy is showing some signs of recovery. Real GDP is estimated to have risen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.9 per cent</span> in the March quarter, the first increase in a year and a half, and well above what had been expected (Table 2). Final spending by the government, as part of the fiscal package announced last year, directly accounted for half of the increase, but there was also an increase in private spending. ", " At this stage, it remains unclear whether private-sector demand will achieve enough momentum to keep the recovery going once the fiscal stimulus comes to an end. There are, however, some encouraging signs. Data on household expenditure suggest further increases during the June quarter. It is possible that consumption will be constrained by weakness in household income growth, as a result of higher unemployment and subdued real wage growth. On the other hand, there is ample scope for Japanese households to reduce saving, provided they are confident enough to spend. On this front, consumer sentiment has been recovering from the lows recorded last year, although it remains weak. ", " Business optimism about the state of the economy has improved, according to the Tankan Survey, and firms currently expect this trend to continue. They also perceive that the availability of credit from banks has improved, suggesting that some progress has been made in relieving problems in the banking sector. To date, manufacturers have been meeting demand by running down excess stocks rather than increasing production, but the run-down in inventories suggests that production will begin to grow if the demand expansion continues. Reflecting substantial and persistent excess industrial capacity, firms expect to curtail investment spending over the course of this year. ", " The Asian economies initially affected by the crisis in 1997 appear to be on the path to recovery, although there are differences in the strength and composition of the upswing (Graph 2). Korea, which was the first of these countries to emerge from recession, has experienced the strongest recovery in activity with output nearing pre-crisis peaks: GDP has risen at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4½ per cent</span> since the trough in the June quarter last year. In Thailand and Indonesia, where the contractions in activity were sharper, output has been rising since the end of last year but still remains well below pre-crisis levels. ", " In each of the countries, the initial impetus to activity has come primarily from spending by consumers and the public sector, supported by expansionary macroeconomic policies. Imports have also picked up over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past six months</span> – particularly in Korea – which has capped the rise in the current account surpluses. Private investment remains weak, however, reflecting the presence of significant excess industrial capacity. External demand is now also beginning to be more supportive of activity following rather lacklustre export growth over the course of last year. To date, Korea has posted the most impressive export performance, with volumes up by <span class=\"no-wrap\">11½ per cent</span> in the March quarter, compared with an average growth rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> per quarter over the course of 1998. Much of the acceleration in exports reflects stronger world demand for electronics, which has also benefited other countries with large electronics sectors (notably Malaysia and Taiwan). Thailand and Indonesia are yet to experience a substantial turnaround in export growth. ", " Gradual progress continues to be made in the long process of restructuring the financial sectors within the initial crisis economies. Financial sector reform is well advanced in Korea, with developments over recent months largely centred on the disposal of non-performing loans held by Korea's asset management company. In Malaysia, the government's asset purchasing vehicle has purchased around one-third of non-performing loans from banks and the recapitalisation of the banking sector is well under way. In Thailand and Indonesia, some progress has been made in the recapitalisation of banks in recent months. This has largely come from private sources in Thailand, while public funds have predominantly been used in Indonesia. ", " Recent trends in activity across the rest of east Asia have been more disparate. Activity in Taiwan and Singapore is picking up, with exports having strengthened over recent months, although, while domestic demand in Singapore is also increasing, in Taiwan it looks to have weakened. By contrast, output in Hong Kong has now declined for six successive quarters, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> lower in the March quarter than its peak in the September quarter 1997. This is primarily due to a sharp fall in private investment and continued weakness in consumption, although more recent retail sales data suggest that consumption may have started to pick up in the June quarter. In China, it appears that the fiscal stimulus, which has driven growth since the second half of 1998, has lessened. This is evident in industrial production, which has remained basically flat over the first half of this year. More positively, exports have strengthened since the beginning of the year, after having fallen significantly through 1998. ", " Following the mild recession in the first half of 1998, the New Zealand economy continues to recover. The production measure of output grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.7 per cent</span> in the March quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> higher than a year ago. As was the case in the December quarter, growth was broadly based, with both investment and private consumption continuing to grow steadily. The pick-up in activity has been reflected in an improving labour market, with the unemployment rate falling three-quarters of a percentage point in the first half of the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.0 per cent</span>. Underlying inflation picked up a little in the June quarter, with prices increasing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span> to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.2 per cent</span> higher over the year. ", " In the core European economies, there are signs of stronger domestic spending, especially in Germany and Italy. Growth in household expenditure across the region has been supported by a high level of consumer confidence and a modest reduction in the unemployment rate. To date, much of the increase in demand has been absorbed by a slowing in the rate of stock accumulation which, in tandem with further declines in export volumes, has limited the pick-up in manufacturing output <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 3)</span>. Nonetheless, business sentiment regarding future production has improved, due partly to a rise in foreign orders, the decline in the value of the euro and the April easing in monetary policy. Price pressures across the euro area remain subdued, with the year-ended rate of inflation remaining close to <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> over recent months, despite the effect of the rise in oil prices. ", " In the United Kingdom, manufacturing activity has been weak over the past year as a result of the slowing in global growth as well as the strength in the pound, although GDP has begun to recover, increasing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 per cent</span> in the June quarter. Domestic demand, particularly consumption, remains strong, boosted by a reduction in interest rates by the Bank of England of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ percentage</span> points since October last year. Inflation has remained close to the target rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span>. ", " Since the announcement of OPEC production cuts in early March, the price of oil has increased by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">45 per cent</span> to around US$21 a barrel, and is almost double the price at the trough in December 1998. The increase brings the price back to the level in late 1997. The price has been supported by the adherence of the OPEC producers to their agreed production levels, and also by declining petroleum inventories in most major industrial countries. Improved prospects for the global economy should help underpin the higher price going forward. To date, the rise in oil prices has added between one-quarter and one-half of a percentage point to headline inflation rates in the major industrial countries. ", " The Australian economy has continued to grow strongly, maintaining an annual growth rate in excess of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> since mid 1997 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 4)</span>. Over the year to the March quarter, GDP increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.8 per cent</span>, and the most recent indicators point to further growth in the June quarter, although probably at a reduced pace. Recent growth has been driven by a continued expansion of domestic demand, while exports have weakened, reflecting a still difficult external trading environment (Table 3). The net effect has been a further widening of Australia's current account deficit (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#balance\">Balance of Payments</a>’). ", " The most important contributor to the growth of domestic demand over the past year has been consumer spending. This has been supported by several factors including strong growth in personal credit, rising household wealth and high levels of consumer confidence. Business confidence is also at a high level in most industries, with mining the most notable exception. Despite the high level of confidence, business survey results have pointed to a weaker investment outlook over the year ahead, which could imply some easing in the overall rate of growth of domestic demand. A significant decline in export earnings has contributed to the downward revisions to business investment plans, and may dampen domestic incomes and spending more generally in the period ahead. However, other aspects of the business environment, including a high level of profits, low interest rates and readily available finance, remain supportive of growth. ", " Following rapid growth throughout much of 1998, consumption recorded an even stronger rate of increase in the early part of 1999. Most of the recent strength of consumption has been in components of a largely discretionary nature. Spending on staple items, such as food, utilities and health, continues to expand at a solid rate, but spending on items of a more discretionary nature – such as <em>recreation &amp; culture</em> and <em>hotels &amp; cafes</em> which together now account for more than one-fifth of consumption – has picked up noticeably. ", " Retail sales have shown a somewhat uneven pattern of growth during the first half of 1999, with an exceptionally strong increase in the March quarter followed by a small decline in the June quarter (Graph 5). This pattern appears to have been affected to some extent by the timing of Easter, which has meant that Easter spending this year was concentrated in March rather than April, as is more usual. Nonetheless, the two quarters together indicate strong growth, with nominal sales increasing at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> over the six-month period. The June quarter national accounts will incorporate some adjustment to reflect the early Easter, which should result in recorded consumption being spread more evenly between the two quarters. Motor vehicle purchases have been relatively steady since the middle of 1998, but nevertheless remain at a high level, following rapid growth over the previous year. ", " Since late last year the strength in consumption has coincided with a rebound in consumer sentiment. According to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey, consumers have been reporting greater optimism concerning employment prospects, their personal financial situations, and the economy more generally. Consumers also reported being very positive about buying major household items in the first half of the year. However, this aspect of consumer sentiment turned down in July, a result which may reflect anticipated declines in wholesale taxes on many household items. In particular, the wholesale tax rate applying to ‘black goods’ such as televisions, videos and disc players was reduced from <span class=\"no-wrap\">32 per cent</span> to 22 per cent in July, and will be replaced by the 10 per cent goods and services tax in the middle of next year. Taxes on motor vehicles will also be significantly reduced. The forthcoming price reductions might induce some deferment of consumer spending on the items affected, although the extent of such behaviour could be moderated by some bringing forward of price reductions by producers. ", " Consumption growth over the past year has generally run ahead of growth in household disposable incomes. Over the year to the March quarter, consumption increased in real terms by 5.3 per cent, compared with growth of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span> in real household disposable income. This brought the household saving rate down to <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span> in the March quarter, which is close to its lowest recorded level. A broader measure of saving, the total gross saving of households and enterprises, has shown a more moderate decline, from around 17 per cent to <span class=\"no-wrap\">15½ per cent</span> of GDP over the past year (see the May 1999 <cite>Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/1999/may/1.html#box-b\">Box B</a>). ", " The strong growth of consumption, and the associated decline in saving rates, has been encouraged by increases in asset values which have contributed to solid growth in household wealth (Table 4). This in turn is likely to have boosted consumer confidence and may also have supported growth of household borrowing. Household wealth increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> in the March quarter and by 11 per cent over the year, due mainly to continued increases in house prices and, to a lesser extent, equity prices. The value of households' direct share holdings rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> in the March quarter and by 35 per cent over the year, more than half of which reflected valuation effects. Aggregate household wealth has risen by a total of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">35 per cent</span> over the past three years. Part of the strength of consumption is also attributable to the increase in wealth available to households from the AMP demutualisation and the capital gain from the first stage of the Telstra float last year; these probably had their main impact on consumer spending around the end of 1998 and early 1999. ", " Strong consumption has also been underpinned by the low interest rate environment. Personal credit slowed a little in the past few months but nonetheless grew at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span> over the first half of the year, driven by increased use of revolving credit products such as overdrafts and credit cards, as well as home equity loans for non-housing purposes. Credit for housing increased at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">14½  per cent</span> over the same period. ", " With total credit to households growing at an annual rate of 14–15 per cent over the first half of 1999, households' aggregate debt/disposable income ratio has continued to rise (Graph 6). Even so, the household debt-servicing burden – the ratio of aggregate interest payments to income – fell slightly in the March quarter. This mainly reflects the fall in mortgage lending rates following the 25 basis-point reduction in the cash rate in December. On average, the servicing burden remains at comfortable levels, despite a doubling in the debt-income ratio in the past 20 years. However, it is likely that this average masks considerable variation across households, and debt-servicing burdens must be considerably higher for some borrowers. ", " After a lull around the September quarter of last year, housing activity picked up in late 1998. Subsequently this momentum has been maintained, although the various indicators are providing contrasting signals about the ongoing strength of the recovery (Graph 7). Measures of financing have grown strongly but indicators of building approvals or work done have been fairly flat, albeit at high levels. Housing credit is growing at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">14½ per cent</span>, compared with rates of around 11 per cent towards the end of 1998. The stronger growth in loan approvals, particularly for existing housing, is indicative of increased turnover of the housing stock, which in the past has tended to spill over into demand for new houses with a lag. On balance, this suggests some likelihood of a pick-up in housing activity later in the year. ", " The increase in demand for housing suggested by the growth of loan approvals may be contributing to upward pressure on house prices, particularly if the loans fund the purchase of existing dwellings. Median house prices in Melbourne and Sydney are more than 10 per cent higher than a year ago <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 8)</span>, while house prices in the other capital cities have generally been more subdued. Median rents have been growing at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> per annum, although this masks strength in Melbourne and Perth and relative weakness in Brisbane and Sydney. ", " The overall business climate remains favourable, with businesses experiencing strong growth in production and profits over the past year. However, there are some significant differences in conditions across industries. The mining sector in particular has experienced difficult conditions resulting from low commodity prices, which have contributed to reduced profits and cutbacks in production. Mining output declined by 3 per cent over the year to the March quarter, although there appears to have been some rebound at the end of that period. The manufacturing sector, which is also relatively exposed to external trade, has performed better over the past year. Production increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span>, although to some extent this was absorbed by growth in inventories rather than in sales. Growth in the services industries remains robust, with particularly strong growth in property and business services, communications, and accommodation, cafes and restaurants. ", " Reflecting the overall strength of demand and output, profits have grown rapidly, with the gross operating surplus of corporate enterprises increasing by 13 per cent over the year to the March quarter. This measure of profitability now stands at <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span> of GDP, a record level, although it has to some extent been boosted by privatisations and the longer-term trend towards incorporation of businesses. As noted above, however, conditions have been quite disparate across industries. In the mining sector, profits declined by 8 per cent over the year, while there was strong profit growth in the service industries and moderate growth in manufacturing profits <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 9)</span>. ", " Recent business surveys have been consistent with these developments. The June quarter NAB Survey showed that business sentiment has remained fairly strong over the first half of 1999, after improving significantly towards the end of last year, and also revealed that most firms expect these healthy conditions to continue over the year ahead. It pointed to some improvement in conditions expected by mining companies, albeit from a very low level, perhaps reflecting improved sentiment regarding the Asian economies and recent increases in some commodity prices. Business conditions for manufacturing and wholesaling firms deteriorated slightly in the June quarter but remain close to longer-run average levels, while conditions improved further in several other industries including retailing, transport, storage and communications, financial services, and construction. ", " Despite the favourable conditions in most industries, there has been a slowing in the rate of growth of business investment recently. After a long upswing during which growth in investment spending had averaged over <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent per annum</span>, the level of business investment has followed a saw-tooth pattern since mid 1998 with little further net growth – there was a sharp increase in the March quarter itself, reversing a decline in the December quarter, but indications from the ABS Capital Expenditure Survey are that there will be a sharp decline in the June quarter. The overall easing of growth in business investment over the past year is partly accounted for by a large decline in mining investment from the high level reached in mid 1998. Over the three quarters to <span class=\"no-wrap\">March 1999</span>, mining investment declined by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span>. Investment in manufacturing also declined over that period, but there was continued growth in investment in the service and construction industries. ", " The Capital Expenditure Survey also suggests weak investment intentions for the year ahead, although the preliminary nature of this estimate means it should be treated with some caution. According to the survey, firms in the mining, construction and accommodation industries expect a substantial reduction in investment in 1999/2000, while sizeable increases are planned in a few industries, such as retailing and the electricity, gas and water industry. In aggregate, and assuming average realisation ratios, the survey would imply a decline in the level of business investment in the year ahead. ", " The expected weakness in investment in buildings and structures implied by the ABS survey appears consistent with other forward indicators for that component of investment spending. Private non-residential building approvals are not at a level which is sufficient to support the present high rate of non-residential construction. There has also been a decline in the stock of work yet to be done on engineering construction projects. Looking further ahead, the Access Economics Property Monitor reports a decline in the value of major new construction projects currently under consideration. ", " Other business surveys suggest a less pessimistic reading of the overall investment outlook. Since the start of the year, the NAB survey has recorded an above-average net balance of firms expecting to increase their investment over the year ahead, after a period of weaker investment intentions during the latter part of 1998. The ACCI-Westpac survey of the manufacturing sector points to a somewhat stronger pick-up in investment plans recently. This appears consistent with other results pointing to a relatively high level of capacity utilisation at present. ", " Also at odds with the weaker investment outlook depicted in the Capital Expenditure Survey results is the current highly supportive financial environment for businesses. The level of interest rates on business loans is at historically low levels, and businesses report finding it easier to obtain finance than they did last year. ", " This is borne out by the growth of business funding (Graph 10). Borrowing by businesses from financial intermediaries, as well as direct debt and equity raisings, has shown solid growth of late. Although not as strong as earlier in the year, business credit increased at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> over the first half of the year. Non-intermediated debt raisings (excluding asset-backed issues, which do not generally fund non-financial businesses' investment activity) have been strong in 1999 to date, after a weaker period in the second half of <span class=\"no-wrap\">last year</span>. Similarly, new equity issues are estimated to have remained at a high level in the June quarter, following strong March and December quarters. Given the availability and low cost of funding, businesses would appear to have considerable scope to finance investment in the period ahead. The strength of business profits and the low level of interest rates also means that, despite a solid build-up in debt, and a gradually rising debt-to-equity ratio, interest burdens remain well below recent peaks. ", " There are several ways in which the contrast between the weaker investment intentions recorded in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Capital Expenditure Survey</span>, and the strong growth of business funding, might be resolved. One is that corporate funding growth may decline in the period ahead to be more consistent with a weaker investment outlook. Another possibility is that some of the growth in business funding is related to corporate takeover activity rather than to new investment. There is some evidence that this has been occurring, although its extent does not seem to be large enough to provide the main explanation for the recent strength of corporate funding. Finally, investment may turn out to be stronger than is currently suggested by the ABS survey. ", " For much of the first half of this year, recorded employment growth, particularly full-time employment, had appeared to be at odds with the continued strength in output growth. While the monthly employment data are volatile, the large rise in employment recorded in June has gone some way to restoring the historical relationship between output and employment. Employment growth of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per  cent</span> over the past year has contributed to a reduction in the unemployment rate to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.2 per cent</span> in June, a full percentage point lower than the rate a year earlier (Graph 11). The participation rate has also fallen slightly over the past year. ", " The participation rate has moved somewhat differently compared with the trends observed in recent periods of similar strength in the economy in 1989 and 1995. It appears that this reflects a slowdown in the long-term trend increase in female participation in the labour force. The female participation rate is now broadly comparable to that in the major industrial countries. ", " The relatively weak employment data up to May, the latest month for which industry employment data are available, conceal the robust employment growth recorded for a number of industries, including retail trade and public administration, which together accounted for more than three-quarters of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> growth in employment over the six months to May. However, employment declines in mining, personal and other services, and finance and insurance over the same period reduced total employment growth by two-thirds of a <span class=\"no-wrap\">percentage point</span>. The decline in the manufacturing industry workforce over the past 18 months appears now to have halted. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand remain firm (Graph 12). The newspaper-based measure of job vacancies reported by the ANZ Bank has increased by more than 6 per cent over the three months to July, to be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier. While the broader ABS survey of job vacancies reported by employers has been unusually volatile over the past year, it rose strongly in the three months to May, and is at historically high levels for both the private and public sectors. The hiring intentions recorded in the major business surveys are also suggestive of ongoing demand for new labour. ", " The combination of strong growth in output and weak recorded employment growth in the early months of the year saw a continuation of the good productivity performance of the previous seven quarters. Measured aggregate productivity in the economy, based on output per hour worked, rose by a little over 1 per cent in the March quarter, with year-ended productivity growth around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per  cent</span>. With the likelihood of some further catch-up in employment growth and a decline in output growth in the months ahead, there may be some slowing in productivity growth from its recent high rate. ", " The subdued state of the world economy continues to have an adverse impact on Australia's exports. In the <span class=\"no-wrap\">June quarter</span>, export earnings declined by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span>, with the total fall over the past year around <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span>. While price reductions continue to be the dominant factor underlying the loss in export revenues, export volumes also declined over the six months to March and are likely to have eased further in the June quarter. ", " Much of the weakness in exports over the past year has been in resource exports, again reflecting both price and volume declines (Graph 13). There were further sharp price reductions in the June quarter as previously negotiated cuts to coal and iron ore prices took effect, combined with the effects of a further fall in the price of gold and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. Revenues from rural exports have also weakened, declining by around 4½ per cent over the past year because of continued price falls, despite strong growth in production and some recovery in demand from Asia. Manufactured export revenues have declined by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4½ per  cent</span> over the past year, compared with average growth of about 14 per cent in the period 1990–1997. In contrast, service export revenues increased slightly in the June quarter, with some recovery in tourism from the east Asian region. ", " Since the onset of the Asian crisis, the decline in exports to the crisis-affected countries has been offset by stronger sales to other markets such as the US and Europe, particularly for resource exports. More recently, the aggregate data suggest that this export diversion may be slowing. However, the changing pattern of gold exports over the past three years has significantly complicated the picture. ", " There were two important developments in this regard. The first was a sharp swing in gold exports to Korea. From 1994 to 1996, the value of gold exports to Korea increased fourfold. Then, from early 1997 (some months before Korea felt the impact of the Asian crisis), the value of gold exports to Korea began to drop away sharply until, by early 1998, it had returned to 1994 levels. The impact of this was offset by the diversion of these gold sales to other markets, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland in 1997, and then to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US and UK in 1998 (Graph 14)</span>. A second factor, which began to affect Australia's gold exports after the onset of the Asian crisis, was the rapid growth in imports of gold from the crisis-affected Asian economies, for subsequent re-export. This peaked in the June quarter 1998, when re-exported gold accounted for around 40 per cent of Australia's total gold exports. Excluding re-exported gold, the value of Australia's gold exports increased more moderately over the year to June 1998 and has since declined sharply, reflecting both price reductions and some decline in volumes. ", " Abstracting from gold exports, growth in the value of resource exports to Korea declined only modestly in the post-crisis period, while there was a more pronounced slowing in resource export growth to the other <span class=\"no-wrap\">crisis-affected</span> economies. This was initially offset by a strong pick-up in resource exports to the US and Europe, which increased by 38 per cent over the year to June 1998 (Table 5). More recently, despite continued growth in volumes, the value of exports to those destinations has fallen, reflecting further declines in commodity prices in foreign currency terms and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. While the value of non-gold resource exports to the crisis-affected economies is no longer falling, this has been more than offset by falls in the value of exports to other destinations, contributing to an overall decline in the value of Australia's resource exports excluding gold of <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> over the past year. ", " Expenditure on imports fell by 0.7 per cent in the June quarter to be only <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> higher than a year ago. The declines in consumption and capital goods imports in the quarter more than offset a rise in intermediate imports. The decline in capital imports, however, was considerably less than the overall reduction in capital expenditure indicated by the Capital Expenditure Survey for the June quarter. ", " Preliminary indications are that import volumes continued to grow strongly in the June quarter to be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> higher over the past year. Import prices are likely to have declined further in the quarter following <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span> of large price reductions. In part, the weakness in the overall measure of import prices reflects the significant appreciation of the Australian dollar since the start of the year. However, it also reflects the effect of compositional change driven by the growing importance of computer imports. These effects may be partially revised away when the ABS updates the reference year to 1997/98, resulting in smaller import price declines and consequently weaker estimates of volume growth over the past year or so. ", " Since the onset of the Asian crisis, the current account deficit (excluding RBA gold) has widened from around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> of GDP to just under 6 per cent as at the March quarter 1999 (Graph 15). In the June quarter, a significant decrease in the value of exports, only partially offset by a modest decline in the value of imports, suggests that the trade component of the deficit widened further by around ½ per cent of GDP. Assuming the net income deficit remains roughly unchanged as a proportion of GDP, this would imply a current account deficit of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">6¼–6½ per cent</span> of GDP in the quarter. ", " Net foreign debt rose by $2.6 billion in the March quarter to $241.6 billion, equivalent to <span class=\"no-wrap\">41.1 per cent</span> of GDP. Total net foreign liabilities of Australians (including equity liabilities) increased by $10.5 billion in the March quarter to $354.2 billion or just over 60 per cent of GDP. The net income deficit was $4.9 billion in the March quarter, a little higher than in the December quarter, mainly reflecting increases in foreigners' income from direct ownership of Australian businesses. The ratio of net income payments to exports increased to <span class=\"no-wrap\">16.2 per cent</span> in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">March quarter</span>, from <span class=\"no-wrap\">15.6 per cent</span> in the December quarter, but remains near its historical average. ", " In aggregate, commodity prices in SDR terms fell again in the June quarter to be down by over 11 per cent from the levels of a year ago (Graph 16). The fall in the quarter was due to declines in non-rural <span class=\"no-wrap\">commodity prices (excluding base metals)</span> of over 5½ per cent, reflecting the recently negotiated cuts to bulk commodity prices (iron ore and coal) and the fall in the price of gold. The sale of 25 tonnes of gold by the Bank of England (with planned sales of 415 tonnes over 5 years) and the prospect of gold sales by the IMF to finance debt relief for developing countries have contributed to the continued weakness in gold prices. In contrast, rural and base metals prices increased strongly in the quarter in SDR terms to be around 7 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> higher, respectively, than their levels at the beginning of the year. These price rises reflect, in part, some improvement in market sentiment about the outlook for the world economy, but also tighter supply of a number of rural commodities, including beef and high-quality wool, and announced production cutbacks for a number of the base metals. ", " Since the onset of the Asian crisis the overall decline in commodity prices in SDR terms has been around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span>. This weakness in commodity prices was at first offset by a sharp depreciation of the Australian dollar, with the result that commodity prices in Australian dollar terms initially increased. Since late 1998, however, an appreciation of the Australian dollar and some further declines in commodity prices in foreign currency terms have resulted in a sharp fall in commodity prices in Australian dollar terms. In June, the commodity price index in Australian dollars was <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> lower than its average level in 1998. ", " Despite the substantial fall in commodity prices since the onset of the Asian crisis, the decline in Australia's terms of trade – the ratio of export prices to import prices – has been relatively mild at around 5 per cent to the March quarter. This experience contrasts with the mid 1980s, when a sharp decline in commodity prices was associated with a reduction in Australia's terms of trade of about <span class=\"no-wrap\">17 per cent</span>. The more moderate recent outcome reflects a decrease in the foreign currency price of many of Australia's imports. ", " The bullish tone taken by international financial markets in the first quarter of 1999 has continued into the middle of the year, albeit a little tamed by developments in monetary policy in the US, where the US Federal Reserve tightened in June, raising the Federal funds rate by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.25 per cent</span> to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.0 per cent</span>. The Fed had instituted a bias to tighten a year ago, but subsequently eased monetary policy in late 1998 (cutting the Federal funds rate in three steps by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.75 percentage</span> points, to 4.75 per cent) to prevent financial markets from seizing up after the near-collapse of a major US hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). This action quickly had a settling effect on markets; equity markets in particular regained, and in some cases exceeded, earlier peaks <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 17)</span>. Against this background, and with the US economy continuing to grow strongly into 1999, it became fairly clear that the insurance the Fed had taken out by easing was no longer needed. ", " The Fed's action to increase interest rates in June had been well telegraphed, with the FOMC adopting a tightening bias in mid May and Chairman Greenspan making statements questioning whether the low level of interest rates remained necessary in the calmer market conditions of 1999. This helped markets to absorb the tightening when it came. In fact, markets seemed to expect more than was delivered so that, when the Fed did move but removed the tightening bias, there was a short-lived rally. This in turn petered out late in July, after some more hawkish Fed statements restored the watchful tone which had characterised markets for most of June and as economic indicators continued to show strength. ", " In Europe, the core euro area last eased monetary policy in April 1999, although some other European countries continued easing as late as June, when the UK, Denmark and Norway cut rates. All had short-term rates above those in the euro currency area and had experienced rises in their exchange rates against the euro over the June quarter. With the exception of Norway, however, markets are now expecting that the easing cycle is completed in Europe, given that economic activity seems to be picking up. ", " The shift in monetary policy stance towards tightening in the US, and the cessation of the easing trend in most other countries, was reflected in a rise in market yields across all maturities. In the case of 10-year bonds, most countries saw yields rise to around the levels prevailing before the LTCM crisis in late 1998 (Graph 18). The sharp dip in yields that took place at that time, as markets became concerned that the world economy might be heading into a deflationary phase, has now been more than reversed. ", " With the US moving to the tightening phase for monetary policy ahead of other countries, it was not surprising that the US dollar remained the strongest of the major currencies in the first half of 1999 (Graph 19). It peaked in May against the Japanese yen and in early July against the euro. The turning points came after the release of economic news suggesting a pick-up in growth in Japan and Europe. In Japan, the release of the first quarter GDP data, which showed surprisingly strong growth, was a major factor turning sentiment, while in Germany markets were particularly impressed by the upturn in business sentiment in June. From a peak of 124 yen, the US dollar subsequently fell to under 115, despite interventions by the Bank of Japan to prevent the yen from strengthening. The euro/US dollar exchange rate strengthened from a low of 1.01 to over 1.07 by late July. ", " Emerging markets, especially those in Asia, have continued to perform strongly through mid 1999. With economies recovering, interest rates have ceased falling and in some countries – such as Korea – have begun to rise. The exception is Indonesia, where political stability has contributed to a stronger currency and allowed the central bank to bring interest rates down sharply, from about <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> in early April to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">14 per cent</span> now. The picture is more patchy in Latin America, which fell into crisis later than Asia and is not yet showing as strong signs of recovery. In Argentina, where the currency board system means monetary policy is tied to that of the US, markets have reacted negatively to the change in US policy direction as the local economy remains weak. ", " Consistent with the strong performance of emerging economies, there has been a resumption of capital flows to some economies, mainly in Asia, in recent months. So far this has mainly been in the form of direct investment, but there has been some portfolio investment including from US mutual funds. This has underpinned a sharp recovery in Asian share markets, with some regaining pre-crisis levels. Emerging market credit spreads, which had fallen to about 10 percentage points in early May, have since fluctuated a little above that level <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 20)</span>. They remain below their peaks of over <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 percentage</span> points, set in September last year, but still well above their pre-crisis levels. ", " With the optimistic tone of world markets stemming the fall in commodity prices since March, the Australian dollar moved higher through to early May, reaching around US67 cents (Graph 21). Once the change in direction of US monetary policy was cemented into market expectations later that month, however, it fell back under <span class=\"no-wrap\">US65 cents</span>. It has since tended to move with the ebb and flow of expectations about US interest rates, rising (again to over <span class=\"no-wrap\">US67 cents)</span> in early July and falling back again towards the end of the month. ", " Overall, the rise in the Australian dollar since late 1998 has run ahead of most commodity price indices, following a period earlier in 1998 when the currency fell by more than commodity prices. The major part of this re-alignment took place in late 1998 as hedge funds were forced out of the short positions they had held through much of that year. In 1999, the Australian dollar has risen further against the background of generally flat commodity price indices. Such divergences should not be too surprising, especially in light of the divergent trends exhibited within most commodity price indices; notably, prices of commodities most directly linked to the world industrial production cycle, such as metals, have risen strongly, while those for some food products and gold have fallen. The general factor that seems to be underpinning the recovery in the Australian dollar is the better outlook for the world economy. ", " While the cash rate – the operational target for monetary policy – has been unchanged at 4.75 per cent since December 1998, market interest rates in Australia began to rise in late April. The main influence was expectations about the Fed's intentions for US monetary policy, as traders, particularly those offshore, saw a Fed tightening as likely eventually to flow through to local interest rates. The yield on 90-day bank bills in Australia moved in April from a level in line with the cash rate target to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> by late June, before moving back to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.95 per cent</span> (Graph 22). Yields on 180-day bills also rose by about 25 basis points, to a bit above <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span>. ", " While the bulk of the rise in short-term yields is consistent with the market expecting that monetary policy in Australia might be tightened in coming months, the rise, particularly for 180-day yields, may also reflect concerns about market liquidity around the turn of the year due to the impact of the century change. ", " The yield on 10-year Government bonds also rose in the period from late April to late June. By early August, yields had moved up further, toward <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.5 per cent</span>, a rise of about 1¾percentage points since their low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">December 1998</span> (Graph 23). At current levels, bond yields have returned to around the levels that prevailed over much of the second half of 1997, when the turbulence in overseas markets saw them begin to drop to the historically low levels of late 1998. Spreads between US and Australian yields have generally stayed in a narrow range in recent months, between 20 and 40 basis points. ", " As in a number of other countries, share prices in Australia fell from their record high of late April as interest rates moved up. They then moved up and down broadly in parallel with those in the United States. In early August, the All Ordinaries Index was 5½ per cent below its peak in late April, but <span class=\"no-wrap\">21 per cent</span> up on its low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">October 1998</span>. This recovery from the lows of last October is less strong than the recovery in US share prices. ", " The pattern of share prices in Australia changed in recent months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 24)</span>. The previous linchpin of growth – share prices of banks – has fallen by 18 per cent from its peak in late April, mainly reflecting expectations of slower growth in bank profits, after the run of strong earnings in recent years. With rises in commodity prices in recent months on the back of improved prospects for world economic growth, resource stocks (excluding gold producers) have surged, to be up by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">55 per cent</span> over their level in December last. The average share price of gold producers has fallen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">17 per cent</span> from its average level in the March quarter, in response to the fall in the price of gold in this period. The index of share prices of industrial companies – comprising manufacturing, retail, telecommunications and the like – rose steadily, to a new record high in July. ", " Rises in yields in wholesale markets have had some limited effect on interest rates on loans from intermediaries. Increases have flowed most directly into interest rates on fixed-rate lending. Banks' three-year fixed rate <span class=\"no-wrap\">housing loans</span> have risen by 55 basis points, and are now at <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.0 per  cent</span>. Interest rates on fixed-term personal loans, both secured and unsecured, have also been increased. Banks have also increased three-year fixed-rate small business loans by 100 basis points, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.4 per cent</span>. ", " Two major banks recently also slightly increased their standard variable home loan rates, to bring these lending rates into line with those of the other majors. The average interest rate available on standard variable-rate housing loans from major banks is now 6.55 per cent compared with 6.50 per cent after the cut in interest rates last December <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 25)</span>. Some banks also increased interest rates on some other lending products to households. These rises reflected two influences: as discussed, the rise in the cost of wholesale funding since intermediaries' rates were cut last December; and strong growth in the demand for credit by households. ", " While some banks raised interest rates on standard products, two banks reduced their ‘honeymoon’ rates for new housing borrowers. A leading mortgage manager raised slightly its standard rate in response to increased wholesale funding costs. ", " Indicator rates on business loans remain at the levels to which they were lowered after the easing of monetary policy. The <em>average</em> interest rate on outstanding variable-rate loans to small businesses, the sum of the indicator rate charged by banks plus individual customer risk margins, was <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.6 per cent</span> in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">March quarter</span> (the latest available), down slightly from the December quarter. This rate now fully reflects the December easing of monetary policy. Overall, this rate has fallen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.3 percentage</span> points more than the cash rate since mid 1996. ", " Total credit of financial intermediaries increased at an annual rate of about 11 per cent over the first half of 1999 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 6)</span>. Growth over the June quarter was a little less than that for March, reflecting a slowing in the growth of personal and business credit, which had picked up significantly in late 1998 and early 1999. ", " Currency in circulation grew at an annual rate of around 8 per cent over the first half of the year, consistent with robust consumer spending. Growth in the broader aggregates, M3 and broad money, has picked up noticeably in recent months, after relatively modest growth earlier in the year; annualised growth over the first half of the year was around 12–14 per cent. The recent strength in deposits at financial intermediaries reflects a significant increase in the issuance of certificates of deposit (CDs) and strong growth in other deposits by corporations. Households' deposits with banks grew by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ per cent</span> over the year to the March quarter. ", " Despite the recent pick-up in growth of broad money and slowdown in growth of credit (to still strong rates), year-ended growth of bank lending remains above that of bank deposits, as has been the case throughout the 1990s (Graph 26). Over the whole period, much of this gap has been funded by banks' net borrowings from abroad. The stock of banks' net offshore liabilities has risen from about <span class=\"no-wrap\">$15 billion</span> at the beginning of the decade to around $75 billion in late 1998. Growth in offshore borrowings has slowed significantly since September 1998, partly as a result of unfavourable conditions in international financial markets at that time; this has been offset by increases in banks' raisings of equity and long-term debt securities, in addition to the more rapid growth of deposits noted above. The gap between growth in bank lending and bank deposits in recent years is also partly explained by relatively weak growth in other uses of funds, including declining holdings of government securities by banks. ", " A feature of financing in Australia in recent months is the surge of issuance in the non-government debt market, an experience which has been shared by other countries. Non-government bonds outstanding have increased by 35 per cent in 1999 to end July, to a level – at $54 billion – slightly above that for State government debt <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 27)</span>. ", " The high rate of issuance of bonds by the non-financial sector has seen total borrowing by that sector increase at a faster rate than intermediated finance <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 28)</span>. In the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">June</span>, the broader financial aggregate, total private domestic debt<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup>, rose by 11.8 per cent, compared with a rise of <span class=\"no-wrap\">10.1 per                          cent</span> in the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">December 1998</span>. ", " The value of funds under management increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.2 per cent</span> in the March quarter and by 13 per cent over the past year, reflecting both a strong net inflow of funds and increases in asset prices. Assets of public unit trusts recorded the most rapid growth, increasing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.1 per cent</span> in the quarter. Assets of cash management trusts have grown at a more moderate pace in recent quarters after enjoying strong growth throughout 1997 and 1998. Holdings of equities and units in trusts increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.5 per cent</span> in the March quarter, accounting for over half of the increase in total managed fund assets (Table 7). ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.4 per cent</span> in the June quarter, taking the year-ended inflation rate to 1.1 per cent (Graph 29). In underlying terms, prices increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3–0.5 per cent</span> in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">June quarter</span> (Table 8). Most measures of underlying inflation suggest an increase of 1½–2 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past year</span> and, in year-ended terms, are currently higher than CPI inflation mainly because they are less affected by the impact of the Government's health insurance rebate, introduced at the beginning of this year. ", " Over the past year, ‘house purchase’ costs and motor vehicle prices have had large but opposite movements. The costs of ‘house purchase’, with a weight of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> in the CPI basket, rose by 1.0 per cent in the June quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.0 per cent</span> over the year to the June quarter. These increases are well in excess of <span class=\"no-wrap\">building-materials</span> price inflation and may reflect the recent firmer demand for housing, which has also been evident in a pick-up in established house prices. But the price of motor vehicles fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.4 per cent</span> in the June quarter, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.7 per cent</span> lower over the year. Domestically produced motor vehicles are still subject to strong competition from imported motor vehicles; their prices are likely to fall substantially after the major elements of the tax package are introduced in just under a year's time. ", " Imported goods prices continue to hold down the aggregate inflation rate, falling again in the June quarter, and are now <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.9 per cent</span> lower than in the corresponding period a year earlier (Graph 30). The quarterly fall was driven by a further decline in the price of imported motor vehicles, although the prices of other imported goods also fell slightly. Measures of domestically sourced inflation – domestically produced goods prices and the price of private-sector services – continue to increase at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. ", " Between mid 1997 and late 1998, the Australian dollar depreciated by around 12 per cent in import-weighted terms and by close to <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> against the major currencies. Over the past year or so, generally around half of this depreciation has been unwound. Prices of imported items recorded ‘at the docks’ have risen and fallen broadly in line with these exchange rate movements, increasing by around 12 per cent over the 18 months to late 1998, and subsequently declining by 5 per cent. However, these price movements at the docks appear to have had little or no impact at the retail level, where prices of imported items have generally continued to decline <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 31)</span>. Since mid 1997, the prices of imported items in the CPI have fallen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¼ per cent</span>, although a rise in the price of overseas holiday travel led to an increase in the price of imported items in the CPI in the June quarter. ", " Most of the fall in the price of imported items at the consumer level over the past two years can be explained by a <span class=\"no-wrap\">12½ per cent</span> reduction in the price of imported motor vehicles, which has led to a 7 per cent fall, overall, in the price of cars. As suggested in the May 1999 <em>Semi-Annual Statement</em>, Box D, this may reflect an increase in competition from Asian car manufacturers. The rise in the exchange rate over the past few quarters has gone some way to restoring margins that were squeezed by the prior exchange rate depreciation and the absorption of higher prices at the docks. Assuming recent levels of the exchange rate are sustained, it now seems less likely that the increase in dock prices over the past two years will appear to any great extent in higher consumer prices. ", " Producer prices generally increased in the June quarter, but earlier declines have kept year-ended inflation rates for these measures very weak or negative (Table 9). An increase in the US dollar price of crude oil of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">35 per cent</span> drove the rise in domestic manufacturers' input costs in the June quarter, but oil prices had fallen in the previous couple of quarters. A fall in the Australian-dollar price of many imported inputs – a result of the higher average exchange rate in the June quarter – provided some offset to the effect of higher oil prices. Final manufacturing prices, excluding oil, fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the June quarter, reflecting a decline in the price of food, beverages and tobacco goods. Falls in the world price of base metals reduced final manufacturing prices over the year to the June quarter. However, a rebound in these prices in recent months could contribute to rises in producer prices in coming quarters. Input prices in the construction industry remain subdued, despite an increase in demand for house-building materials following the Sydney hailstorm. ", " Consistent with the low inflation outcomes in recent quarters, wages growth remained moderate in the first half of 1999 (Table 10). The Wage Cost Index (WCI) recorded an average increase in wage rates (excluding bonuses) of 0.9 per cent in the March quarter and 3.0 per cent over the year to the March quarter 1999. On a year-ended basis, this measure of wages growth has declined slightly from a rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 per cent</span> recorded over the year to the September quarter 1998, the first full year for which it was available. Preliminary data on average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) for the three months to May suggest that wages rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span> in the quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.8 per cent</span> over the year. Average weekly earnings (AWE) increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.2 per cent</span> over the year to May 1999. ", " These measures suggest that wages growth during the past year has been more rapid in the public sector than in the private sector. It is possible that there has been some overstatement of recent public-sector wage increases in the WCI, to the extent that the index has been unable to capture the offsetting cost savings arising from the trading off of some employment conditions in one large agreement, because these conditions were not specific to particular jobs. Both the WCI and AWOTE show private-sector wages growing at a little under <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> over the latest year. ", " Federal enterprise agreements, which provide wage increases for approximately one-fifth of employees, also continued to suggest moderating wages growth in the first quarter of the year. New enterprise agreements certified in the March quarter yielded, on average, wage increases of a little less than 4 per cent per annum to be paid over the next 2½ years <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 32)</span>. Replacement agreements generally continue to specify smaller annualised wage rises than those provided for by the expiring agreements. The annual growth in executive salaries has also eased over the past 18 months, according to the Mercer Cullen Egan Dell Quarterly Salary Review, from an annual rate of around 6 per cent to 4.7 per cent over the year to the June quarter. ", " Some business surveys suggest that the low point in wages growth may have been reached. The NAB survey for the June quarter indicated that businesses expect higher wages growth in the quarter ahead, but the increase is moderate and suggests annualised wage increases of under <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span>. The ABS business expectations survey for the June quarter also suggests that respondents expect slightly higher wages growth over the year ahead than they expected three months ago. ", " Business surveys indicate that firms plan to increase prices only moderately in the near term (Graph 33). The NAB survey for the June quarter suggests that firms expect to increase prices by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the September quarter; the expectation for retailers is slightly lower than the average. The September quarter was the third consecutive quarter for which the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported a greater number of firms expecting to decrease than increase prices. The ABS survey of business expectations continues to suggest price rises of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> over the year ahead. ", " Financial market economists are forecasting moderate price rises over the medium term, although the tax package becomes a significant factor in the forecasts after June 2000. The median response in a survey conducted by the Bank is for CPI inflation to reach <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.2 per cent</span> over the year to June 2000 (Table 11). For the year to June 2001, CPI inflation (excluding the effect of the tax package) is also forecast to be 2.2 per cent. On average, economists in this survey are expecting the first-year effect of the GST to add about <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> to prices, which would take the expected increase in the CPI for the year to June 2001 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.2 per cent</span>. These estimates of the first-year effect of the GST are quite dispersed, however, with some economists forecasting that the effect may be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span>. Inflation forecasts of financial market participants implied by the price of long-dated indexed bonds also appear to reflect a pick-up in inflation expectations over the medium term; the implied forecast is now around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span>, a percentage point higher than the expectation held six months ago. This is also likely to include some allowance for the effect of the GST on prices. The survey of trade union officials conducted by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT) indicates that inflation is expected to be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> by mid 2000, rising to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> over the following year; many respondents appear not to have incorporated a GST effect in their forecasts. ", " Households' inflation expectations for the year ahead, as surveyed by the Melbourne Institute, have risen from around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3¾ per cent</span> in 1998 to around 4¾ per cent on average since the beginning of 1999. The inflation expectations of persons in the survey most likely to be involved in price setting, namely managers and professionals, rose distinctly in June and July. Much of the increase in inflation expectations in recent months appears to be in response to the publicity surrounding the introduction of the Government's tax package, despite the fact that the major changes do not occur until July 2000, which was beyond the horizon of the surveys conducted during the first half of this year. ", " Inflation has edged up from the low point reached in late 1997. Most underlying measures put the rate of inflation over the year to June 1999 at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1¾  per cent</span>, and at a slightly higher rate over the second half of that period. The gradual increase in inflation has occurred despite continued falls in import prices, implying a modest pick-up in domestically sourced inflation. ", " Import prices have for some time exerted a restraining influence on consumer price inflation. The extent of this effect was unexpected. Historical experience suggested that, with the exchange rate depreciation between <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1997</span> and late 1998 squeezing profit margins on imported items, some eventual impact in the form of higher import prices at the retail level could be expected. But an environment of intense competition in markets for internationally traded goods, partly related to the Asian crisis but also the general world economic slowdown, has resulted in the expected rise in import prices to the consumer being almost totally absent so far, even though measures of import prices at the docks did rise during 1998. Over the past two years, in fact, import prices at the retail level have been declining at an annual rate of more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>, directly reducing the CPI inflation rate and putting downward pressure on prices of those domestically produced goods with which they compete. The motor vehicle market, as noted above, offers a prominent example of this process. ", " How far these competitive conditions will continue to generate declines in retail import prices remains, as in previous reports and <em>Semi-Annual Statements</em>, an important source of uncertainty. The eventual size of the likely pass-through has been reduced by the more recent strengthening of the Australian dollar in the first half of 1999, which has reversed around half of the earlier depreciation; this, if it persists, will allow some scope for profit margins on imported goods to be rebuilt without price increases at the retail level. Notwithstanding these influences, it appears unlikely that import prices will continue to reduce the inflation rate to the same extent as has been the case in the recent past. The somewhat firmer international economic outlook and the recent increases in a number of commodity prices suggest that the competitive forces driving these outcomes are more likely to lessen a little than to intensify. Consistent with this, the reduction in imported goods prices over the past two quarters has been smaller than in earlier quarters, and prices for overseas holiday travel actually increased over the year to June. Were import prices in aggregate to stop falling in the period ahead, that would imply a slight increase in overall inflation from its current rate. ", " As noted above, there has been a slight increase in the rate of inflation of domestically produced components of the CPI recently, which may reflect stronger demand conditions as the economy has continued to grow at an above-trend pace over the past year. There has been a noticeable increase in consumers' inflation expectations, much of it probably related to uncertainties about the operation of the new tax system. At this stage, however, there is little sign that the recent strength of the labour market is placing any general upward pressure on wage costs. In aggregate, wages are currently increasing at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span>, with slightly higher increases – between 3½ and <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> – in the enterprise bargaining sector. Productivity continues to grow strongly, which is containing unit labour cost growth to very low levels, although some cyclical decline in productivity growth is likely over the year ahead. ", " Other factors affecting prices include reductions in wholesale sales tax for some items in July, which will slightly reduce the September quarter CPI, and rises in taxes on tobacco products, which will increase it later in the year. Higher levels of international oil prices (which are assumed to remain at US$20 per barrel) will also have an effect over the next several quarters. ", " Taking account of all these forces, the Bank's assessment is that inflation as measured by the CPI will increase further in the year ahead, rising a little above 2 per cent on an annual basis during the first half of 2000 as the impact of the health insurance rebate passes. In underlying terms, inflation is likely to be running at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> during the first half of 2000. ", " Looking further ahead, the introduction of the new tax system will be an important factor in inflation outcomes from the second half of 2000. With some of the indirect tax reductions in the package not due to take effect immediately, the initial effect on prices in the September quarter 2000 will be higher than the estimated long-run effect. The Bank intends to abstract from the first-round effects of the GST on the price level, and to focus on the ongoing rate of inflation. One uncertainty in assessing trend inflation post-GST is that the reactions of wage and price setters to the GST are as yet unknown. It is clear that price expectations measured a year ahead have risen on account of the GST, as would be expected, but there is no way at present of assessing whether wage claims will also increase or, even if they do, whether such claims would be successful and so initiate ‘second round’ effects. Prospects for such an outcome would depend in part on the state of the labour market, and also the degree of competition in product markets, at the time. At present, with growth expected to decline a little in the year ahead, the Bank anticipates that there will be relatively little in the way of second-round effects, and that inflation will settle back into the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2–3 per cent</span> range within a year of the GST's implementation. Clearly, this issue warrants close monitoring over the period ahead. "], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/1999/aug/1.html"},

Most of this reassessment occurred in the March quarter, when estimates of global growth were marked down and further sharp falls in share prices occurred. More recently, there have been some signs, at least in financial markets, of greater confidence in the economic outlook re-emerging, no doubt helped by the substantial monetary easing that has taken place in the United States and other English-speaking economies. Nonetheless considerable uncertainty remains. ", " The US economy and financial markets have been central to the reassessment of the global outlook that has occurred. US growth slowed quickly and unexpectedly in the December quarter last year, and for a time during the March quarter many forecasters were pointing to the possibility of a contraction in GDP in that quarter. In the event, the outcome was better than expected, with the data recording growth in the quarter, albeit at a fairly modest pace. ", " The path ahead for the US will depend on how much of last year's inventory build-up has still to be corrected, and whether there is a continuing impact from the share market weakness: broadly-based measures of US share prices remain about 20 per cent below last year's peaks, even after the sizeable recent recovery. The extent of the unfolding decline in investment in information technology, from the very high levels reached in 2000, is also a factor which will be important for the US outlook. ", " Significantly for Australia, Asia has been one of the regions most affected by the slowing of US demand, particularly for technology products. The economies in east Asia slowed abruptly late in 2000 and in early 2001, after a period of strong growth, as the boom in world demand for information-technology products ended. In addition, the largest economy in the region – Japan – continues to suffer from continuing domestic problems such as impaired balance sheets, weak asset prices, and deflation in prices for goods and services. The low level of the Australian dollar is helping to cushion the impact of this international deterioration on the domestic economy, but it is unlikely that Australia will be unaffected by the sort of slowing that has occurred in world growth. ", " The Australian economy slowed quite sharply in the second half of 2000 and conditions remained weak in the early months of 2001. A moderation in growth had long been anticipated, but it was expected to be relatively mild. Why then was the outcome so much weaker than expected? The answer lies mostly in the exceptionally large decline in dwelling investment, which was a result of the transitional effects of introducing the GST. A slowdown has also clearly occurred in many other areas of the economy. But the housing downswing, which was larger and faster than expected, accounts for most of the difference between the mild overall slowdown in growth which was anticipated and the small net contraction in output which the national accounts recorded over the second half of last year. ", " Of itself, the housing sector weakness was always likely to be a temporary factor, and there are signs that the housing sector is beginning to recover. But the weakness in housing construction flowed on to affect some other parts of the economy, noticeably the manufacturing sector. The greater-than-expected decline in overall growth, both internationally and at home, also had a significant impact on consumer and business confidence. Measures of business sentiment had already weakened late in 2000, but declined further in the March quarter. Consumer confidence declined sharply after the publication of the December quarter GDP result (which was affected by the above one-off factors) and remained low thereafter. Confidence was also affected by the decline in the exchange rate at that time, which reached a new low against the US dollar. ", " The labour market has reflected the above developments. Particularly notable has been the fall in employment in construction, which accounted for all of the net decline in employment between August and February. Employment in the rest of the economy fell for a few months but then began to grow again, though at a reduced pace from that seen in early 2000. The decline in job vacancies among skilled occupations also has been heavily concentrated in the construction and related sectors. Overall, the unemployment rate has moved up, and could rise somewhat further as the labour market will lag any strengthening in economic growth. ", " Inflation in Australia remains well-contained, despite the fall in the exchange rate. The latest CPI data showed a rise of 6 per cent for the year to March. Of this, around 3 percentage points is likely to be the effect of the GST and other tax measures, with a further contribution from the rise in petrol prices. Measures of underlying inflation, with allowance for GST effects, are around 2½ per cent. ", " This assessment of underlying inflation is higher than the figure of around 2 per cent the Bank offered, based on the December quarter data, in the previous <em>Statement</em>. The December quarter data were unexpectedly low, given the extent of cost increases observed over the preceding year, and suggested some squeeze on firms' profit margins. The Bank's judgement is that the most recent result is likely to reflect the partial unwinding of that squeeze, including the passing through of some exchange rate effects. Given the subdued state of domestic demand growth at present, a continuation of this process appears to be manageable without a significant deterioration in medium-term inflation performance. Growth of labour costs has picked up slightly over the past year, as would be anticipated after a lengthy period of labour market strength, but the softer labour market conditions now being observed should cap this trend in due course. Overall, the Bank expects that inflation will remain within the 2–3 per cent target zone in the period ahead. ", " Between early February and early April, the Bank eased monetary policy three times, taking cash rates almost to their previous cyclical low points. The pace of easing exceeded that at which interest rates rose last year, and was also faster than the previous period of monetary policy easing in 1996–98. ", " The reason for this rapid action by the Bank was the speed of the change in both international and domestic circumstances during the first few months of the year. Some moderation in global growth had been expected, but the speed and extent to which the slowing emerged were a surprise. At the same time, the unexpected weakness of the housing sector, its effects on manufacturing and the deterioration in business and consumer confidence became clearer. The possible effects on spending of this decline in confidence posed the risk of more persistent weakness in demand even after the housing downswing finished. ", " Given that inflation remained well-controlled, this combination of risks to the outlook for economic activity meant that there was a <em lang=\"la\">prima facie</em> case for an easing of monetary policy, to return policy to a clearly expansionary setting. The confidence that the community and financial markets have that inflation will be kept low, moreover, also meant that there was ample scope for easing to proceed relatively quickly. ", " As a result of this sequence of interest rate reductions, financial conditions have become quite accommodative. In real terms, interest rates are low relative to historical experience. The level of the real exchange rate, although rising over the past month, is also around its historical low, and the growth of credit is strong. Under most circumstances, these conditions would be expected to facilitate a pick-up in growth. Capital market developments over recent weeks have been suggestive of improved confidence: share markets in Australia, which declined much less than overseas markets earlier in the year, have returned to peak levels; credit spreads on corporate bonds are falling; and the extreme uncertainty that drove government bond yields down seems to have abated. There are also early signs that lower interest rates, together with recent Government initiatives, are starting to produce a turnaround in the housing market. ", " With these encouraging signs, and with a significant easing in monetary policy having occurred since the beginning of February, the Bank stayed its hand at its May meeting. Whether such promising trends will continue, turning into a sustained strengthening of growth, remains unclear at present, partly because the course of events will be influenced strongly by overseas developments, about which there is still a good deal of uncertainty. The Bank will continue to monitor all the relevant information and respond if appropriate. ", " The slower growth in the second half of 2000 has continued into 2001. Real GDP grew by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.7 per cent over the year to the March quarter – less than half that recorded in the middle of last year (Graph 1). In response to the slowdown in growth, the Federal Reserve Board has reduced official interest rates by a total of 200 basis points since the beginning of the year. In its policy announcements, the Fed has expressed concern about the effect lower profitability and the decline in wealth, associated with the fall in equity markets, may have on investment and consumption. ", " Despite the low level of consumer confidence, slower employment growth and the decline in household wealth associated with the falls in equity prices, consumption grew by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter (Graph 2), supported by continued strong growth in household borrowing. A major risk to the outlook for consumption is the prospect of households seeking to rebuild savings in response to the fall in household wealth. Partially offsetting this, the new administration has announced a range of tax incentives that should boost private demand, while lower home mortgage rates have eased the debt service burden of households. The reduction in mortgage rates over the past year has also boosted the housing sector, with investment in housing increasing by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter, after declining through the second half of 2000. ", " In contrast, the pace of business investment has slowed sharply in the past two quarters, particularly investment in plant and equipment, reflecting an increase in spare capacity combined with heightened concerns over the outlook for the economy. The slowdown in the business sector has been most pronounced in manufacturing, as weaker sales growth in both domestic and external markets led to an unanticipated increase in inventories and a reduction in profits. However, there are some signs that the manufacturing sector may have reached its trough. The National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) survey of manufacturers has recovered a little, although it remains at low levels, and the inventory correction in some areas of manufacturing appears to have been relatively rapid. Against this, there are increasing signs that the weakness in manufacturing is spreading to other sectors, evidenced by falling profits in the latter part of 2000 and into 2001. ", " The labour market has thus far remained relatively resilient to the slowdown in growth, but signs of weakness are emerging. Employment growth averaged nearly 120,000 per month over the first three months of 2001, compared with an average of less than 50,000 (adjusted for census and striking workers) in the December quarter 2000. Employment did, however, decline in the month of March, as falls in employment in the retail and wholesale trade and some services sectors added to the existing weakness in employment in the manufacturing sector. The unemployment rate has increased gradually over the past six months to 4.3 per cent, compared with the low of 3.9 per cent recorded last October, and jobless claims are around their highest level in nearly a decade. ", " Wages growth has remained steady at a little over 4 per cent (Graph 3). Consumer price inflation has declined from its recent highs although core inflation has edged higher to be 2.7 per cent over the year to March 2001, compared with 2 per cent in early 2000. The price of services continues to increase at a strong rate but goods prices fell in March. ", " Growth in the Japanese economy also slowed in the second half of 2000 (Table 1), and the near-term outlook for Japan appears rather poor. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's overall business activity index suggests that activity has remained broadly flat in recent months (Graph 4). Further, the Bank of Japan's <em>Tankan</em> survey recorded a deterioration in business sentiment in the March quarter – the first since December 1998. This decline largely reflected concerns about external demand conditions – export volumes in March 2001 were around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> below their peak in August 2000. Over the same period, industrial production declined by 6 per cent while machinery orders were 16 per cent lower. These factors have caused businesses to scale back their capital expenditure intentions for the year ahead. ", " The prospects for a sustained rebound in consumption appear poor, although recent data indicate that household expenditure increased early in 2001. Job offers fell in the first three months of 2001 for the first time since <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1999</span>, and employment growth in recent months has weakened. Household income is growing only slowly, and consumer sentiment has declined to be below its long-run average after rising steadily through 1999 and most of 2000. ", " The deteriorating outlook has prompted a number of stimulatory policy initiatives from the Bank of Japan and the Government. The Bank of Japan has returned to its zero-interest-rate policy and announced that it intends to retain it until consumer prices stop falling. At present, prices are continuing to fall: excluding food, consumer prices fell by 0.6 per cent over the year to March. The Government recently announced measures to facilitate the removal of non-performing loans from domestic banks' balance sheets over the next two to three years, as well as proposals for limiting banks' corporate share holdings. ", " After growing strongly through the first three quarters of 2000, economic growth in non-Japan Asia slowed abruptly in the December quarter. The slowdown was caused by declines in both external and private domestic demand. The pace of growth has softened most noticeably in Singapore and Korea, both of which recorded declines in output in the most recent quarters (Graph 5). ", " The slowdown in the US economy and the sharp decline in global demand for ITC equipment has had a marked effect on the region's exports. Exports had grown by around 15 per cent over the first three quarters of 2000 but declined by 2 per cent in the December quarter. Exports of electronic goods accounted for much of the decline, but growth in non-electronic exports also slowed noticeably. The outlook for ITC production and exports is likely to remain constrained in the near term given the decline in new orders for electronics in the US (Graph 6). The slowdown in exports has spilled over into a fall in industrial production in the region from its peak in August 2000 and contributed to the decline in business investment. ", " Consumption growth in the region also slowed sharply in the December quarter, in part reflecting a slowdown in employment growth and rising unemployment. The level of employment in Korea and Taiwan is little changed from a year earlier and the unemployment rates in the two countries have drifted up from their lows in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">middle of 2000</span>. ", " In response to the weaker outlook for the external sector and waning domestic spending, policy-makers across the region have eased macro-economic policies to support growth in the short term. In Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan more expansionary fiscal policies have been adopted, while in Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines interest rates have been reduced to boost domestic consumption and investment. ", " The New Zealand economy grew solidly in 2000, though growth slowed towards the end of the year. Those parts of the economy most exposed to external markets performed relatively better, reflecting the effect of the exchange rate depreciation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has reduced official interest rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">half a percentage point</span> in the past two months to 6 per cent, citing concerns about the outlook for the world economy. Consumer price inflation remains above the RBNZ's target band, despite prices falling by 0.1 per cent in the March quarter. ", " Growth in the euro area slowed a little in the second half of 2000, as weaker domestic demand was only partially offset by a stronger contribution from the external sector (Graph 7). Consumer spending has picked up a little <span class=\"no-wrap\">in 2001</span>, supported by high levels of consumer confidence, tax cuts, and solid employment growth. The euro area unemployment rate has fallen to 8.4 per cent, the lowest in over ten years. In contrast, industrial production and new orders have weakened and business sentiment has continued to decline. Consumer price inflation has declined, but at 2.6 per cent in March, remained above the ECB's 2 per cent target. The core measure of inflation has gradually increased to be 1.8 per cent in March. ", " In the United Kingdom, growth was again relatively modest in the March quarter. Industrial production has fallen by 1¾ per cent from its peak in August last year, and business sentiment has declined. Strong growth in consumption has continued into 2001, underpinned by the low unemployment rate and steady growth in wages. The Bank of England cut rates by 0.25 per cent in April to 5.5 per cent, the second cut for the year, citing concerns about slowing world growth, the impact of the foot-and-mouth epidemic and recent sharp falls in share prices. ", " The outlook for the world economy for 2001 has been continuously downgraded over the past six months, primarily driven by increased pessimism about the outlook for the US economy and the effect that a weaker US economy is likely to have on those countries that have extensive trade linkages with it. The IMF has reduced its forecast for global growth for 2001 to 3.2 per cent from 4.2 per cent last October, a considerable slowdown from growth of 4.8 per cent recorded in 2000 (Graph 8). The average of private-sector forecasts is similar to these numbers. World growth is expected to rebound in 2002, but the recovery is highly dependent on the recovery in the US economy: the IMF is expecting growth in the US economy to pick up to 2.5 per cent in 2002 from <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.5 per cent</span> in 2001. ", " Inflation remains generally well contained in the major industrialised countries. The main source of inflationary pressure has been the rise in the price of oil, but to date, there has been relatively little spillover into other prices, and more recently this pressure has abated as oil prices have declined from their highs of mid 2000. ", " The benign inflation environment has enabled policy-makers to respond swiftly to the deterioration in growth prospects. While the easier fiscal and monetary policies should act to stabilise confidence in the near term and stimulate domestic demand later in the year, the IMF identifies significant downside risks. In particular, the prospects of lower world growth could expose fragilities in financial markets and intensify the downward pressures on equity markets in the US and elsewhere. ", " The process of global monetary easing that began in the US in early January 2001 continued over the past few months. The Federal Open Market Committee has now cut the Fed funds target by a cumulative 200 basis points, to 4.5 per cent, the most aggressive start to an easing cycle in the US since the mid 1980s <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 9</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">Table 2)</span>. Financial markets continue to price-in further interest rate reductions over coming months with trading in futures markets suggesting that the Fed funds target will fall to 4 per cent by mid year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 10)</span>. This is below the previous trough of 4.75 per cent in late 1998, though not as low as in the early 1990s recession when the Fed funds rate fell to 3 per cent. ", " Other English-speaking countries have also eased monetary policy since the beginning of 2001, though not to the same extent as the US. Aside from the easings in Australia, which are discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’, the Bank of Canada has cut the overnight cash rate by 100 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.75 per cent</span>, and the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have both reduced their target rate by 50 basis points to 5.50 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively. ", " The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has also eased policy, cutting the overnight call rate by 10 basis points to 0.15 per cent in late February, and then in mid March adopting a new set of operating procedures which in effect returned the overnight call rate to near zero. To complement its injection of short-term liquidity, the BoJ also announced that it will increase its outright purchases of long-term government bonds. Moreover, to bolster confidence that this policy will halt the deflationary forces in the economy, the BoJ has stated that the current policy will remain in place until underlying inflation rises to at least zero per cent on a year-ended basis. ", " In Europe, the Swiss National Bank eased rates by 25 points in March, to 3.25 per cent, but the European Central Bank remains the exception among the major central banks, keeping policy rates unchanged at 4.75 per cent. European policy rates are now above those in the US for the first time since late 1994. ", " Many Asian countries, including Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Malaysia have also eased monetary policy over recent months in response to some slowdown in their economies. Several other emerging market economies, however, have had to raise interest rates despite slowing output growth to counter exchange rate pressures. Included in this group are Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil. ", " Over the past month or so, the fall in US bond yields that had been going on since May last year (when the Fed carried out its last monetary tightening) seems to have ended <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 11)</span>. Yields on 10-year US bonds last May were about <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.5 per cent</span>, the same as the then Fed funds rate. By the start of the December quarter they had drifted down to a little under 6 per cent, but then fell sharply further as the US economic and financial situation deteriorated and investors sought safe haven in government bonds. The fall continued into the first three months of this year, with yields reaching a low of 4.75 per cent in mid March. Since then, bond yields have risen quite sharply again, back to their early January levels, as the Fed's cuts to official interest rates contributed to a general improvement in financial market sentiment, including a substantial recovery in the equity market. ", " Over recent months there have been substantial changes in the slope of the yield curve in the US (Graph 12). In early January, the yield on 10-year Treasury securities was about 160 basis points below the then Fed funds target – i.e. the yield curve was inverted. The yield curve last showed such a significant inversion just before the US moved into the early-1990s recession. By early May, however, following substantial cuts in short rates and a rise in long rates, the 10-year yield was 70 basis points above the Fed funds target. This more normal relationship points to greater confidence in markets that the rapid easing by the Fed will avoid a prolonged period of weakness in the US economy. ", " Another indication of some reduction in risk aversion in US markets is that credit spreads on non-government bonds have fallen back somewhat after rising sharply last year (Graph 13). These spreads tend to rise during periods of economic uncertainty as investors in those circumstances prefer the security of government debt. During 2000, these spreads rose to levels last seen in the early 1990s recession. They remain above average, though well down from their peaks. ", " In European bond markets, yields on long-term government debt have followed a similar pattern to US yields, although the magnitude of movements has been more muted than that in the US. Yields on German 10-year government debt fell by around 25 basis points between January and mid March to 4.6 per cent. However, like US yields, they have since more than retraced these falls, moving to around 5.0 per cent. The spread between US and German 10-year government bonds narrowed to only around 5 basis points in late March, but has since moved out to around 20 basis points. ", " Japanese long-bond yields have broadly followed the same pattern as seen in the US and Europe over the past few months. They fell quite sharply over January, February and the first half of March, with yields on 10-year bonds reaching a low of around 1.05 per cent as the outlook for the economy deteriorated, equity prices fell and the BoJ eased monetary policy further. There has been a small rise in bond yields since then as the equity market recovered. ", " Among emerging bond markets, a clear distinction is evident between Latin America and Asia (Graph 14). In the former, credit spreads have risen significantly, due to concerns about the sustainability of exchange rate arrangements in Argentina and possible contagion of financial instability to neighbouring countries. Spreads in Asia, in contrast, have fallen marginally. Even though economic growth in most Asian economies is slowing, their finances, both public and external, generally remain in good shape and investors see little need to demand higher risk premia. ", " World share markets experienced large falls over February and March as uncertainty regarding the economic outlook increased and corporate earnings expectations fell. In the US, the fall was led by the technology-rich NASDAQ index, which fell 43 per cent during its February/March decline, to a level 68 percent below its peak of about a year ago (Graph 15 and Table 3). For much of 2000, share market weakness was concentrated in this sector, but in early 2001 it spread more widely. The Dow Jones industrial average (which covers largely ‘blue chip’ stocks) fell <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> between January and March. ", " In early April, sentiment changed as investors began to look through the current economic weakness to an expected rebound in economic growth and the associated improvement in profits. Since the early April trough, the NASDAQ has risen by around 30 per cent, while broader indices rose by about half that amount. It is too early to tell whether these recoveries, despite being substantial, will prove to be lasting. On a couple of previous occasions over the past year the fall in the NASDAQ was punctuated by significant rises, but each proved to be temporary. ", " One consideration is that share prices remain high relative to traditional measures of share valuation such as <span class=\"no-wrap\">price-earnings</span> ratios (Graph 16). The current P/E for the S&amp;P 500, for example, of around 25, remains well above its historical average of 16 even though it is well down from the peak of 36 last year. Price-earnings ratios of technology stocks also remain high (over 100), as the recent large price falls have been accompanied by steep declines in earnings. ", " Share prices in other countries have generally taken their lead from the US. The German DAX fell around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> over February and the first half of March, but has since recovered over half that amount. The Japanese Nikkei fell 16 per cent from the beginning of the year, hitting a 16-year low of 11,820 in mid March before recovering all of this fall. Share prices in emerging markets also weakened in early 2001 but have not recovered as much as those in developed countries more recently (Graph 17). ", " The defining characteristic of international currency markets since 1997 – a strongly rising US dollar – remained in place in the early months of 2001 (Graph 18). Between the start of the year and early April it climbed a further <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> on a trade-weighted basis. The rise was puzzling as the factors which had been used to explain the US dollar's strength over the previous few years had all turned around: the US economic outlook was deteriorating more rapidly than elsewhere, equity prices were falling sharply, and the extent to which interest rate differentials favoured the US was narrowing. ", " Despite this, the US dollar's appreciation was broad-based, with rises against every major currency in the world <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 19)</span>. This included the yen, which had managed to stay with the US dollar for much of 2000. Over the March quarter the US dollar appreciated by 7 per cent against the euro, 10 per cent against the yen, <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> against sterling, 5 per cent against the Canadian dollar, 8 per cent against the Swiss franc, and <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> against the Australian dollar. ", " More recently, however, there have been some signs of a change in sentiment in currency markets and the US dollar's upward momentum appears to have stalled. Since early April, the trade-weighted US dollar has fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. As with the earlier strength, the recent weakness has been broadly based against the major industrialised economies. ", " It is hard to pinpoint the reasons for this turnaround or its timing. Taking account of other market developments, such as the rise in US bond yields, the fall in credit spreads and the recovery in equity markets, it could be that the calming of financial market nervousness may have reduced the earlier safe haven demand for US dollars. ", " Currencies of those Asian countries with floating exchange rates have fallen significantly against the US dollar over the past year, with falls ranging from 6 per cent for the Singapore dollar to 40 per cent for the Indonesian rupiah <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 20)</span>. The US dollar's strength on world markets was an important factor in explaining these falls and to that extent they represented an appropriate response by floating exchange rates. Some of the larger falls also reflected domestic developments, including political uncertainty. In trade-weighted terms, the falls in these currencies have been much smaller than against the US dollar. ", " From its local peak in early January of US57.3 cents, the Australian dollar fell to a low of US47.8 cents in early April <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 21)</span>. This was one of the largest percentage falls in the currency in such a short period since the mid 1980s. It sits oddly against the generally bullish predictions by market analysts at the start of the year. ", " Part of the reason for this unexpected fall was the further surge in the US dollar which, as noted above, was itself a puzzling development. The Australian dollar's fall against currencies other than the US dollar was substantially smaller. The fall against the euro and the yen, for example, was only about half that against the US dollar. Mirroring this, the trade-weighted index fell significantly less than the exchange rate against the US dollar. ", " Aside from the role played by the strong US dollar, the reasons for this latest fall in the Australian dollar are not as yet clear. Part of the explanation may be that expectations of Australian growth were revised down sharply over these months. Up until the release of the December quarter national accounts, general expectations had been that the Australian economy would be more resilient than the US economy, as many of the sources of weakness in the US (particularly falling share prices and a very high exchange rate) were not present domestically. ", " The fall in output shown by the national accounts caught market participants by surprise. These data proved pivotal in changing assessments about the economy, with forecasts for activity in the year ahead revised down sharply. The consequential changes to the expectations about equity returns and interest rates were a significant negative for the exchange rate. Much of the weakness of the exchange rate occurred in the couple of weeks following that data. ", " Over the past month or so, the Australian dollar has staged a substantial recovery. Just as the earlier fall was to some extent a reflection of US dollar strength, the recent rise, to a degree, has been the counterpart of a fall in the US dollar in world markets. But not all the rise can be attributed to this: the Australian dollar has risen against all other major currencies, indicating independent strength. Contributing to this was some refocussing by markets away from the disappointing December quarter national accounts to the underlying strengths of the Australian economy, particularly the lack of imbalances. Also contributing was the further cut in US interest rates. It not only widened the extent to which interest rates favoured Australia but also made markets more comfortable about prospects for a recovery in US (and, therefore, world) economic activity, as evidenced by a rise in bond yields, a strong recovery in share prices and falls in credit spreads in private debt. In this environment, the Government's decision to disallow Shell's takeover of Woodside had little lasting impact. ", " The current level of the exchange rate against the US dollar, at around US52 cents, is still unusually low. The currency is also near its all-time lows against the yen. However, on average against the currencies of other industrial countries (the euro area, the pound, the Swiss franc, the Swedish krona and the Canadian and <span class=\"no-wrap\">New Zealand</span> dollars) it remains not much different from the rates that have prevailed for most of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">post-float</span> period <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 22)</span>. It is well above its average levels against currencies which maintain an adjustable peg against the US dollar, since these countries (largely those in Asia) have had a history of periodic devaluations. These patterns suggest a more encouraging assessment of the Australian dollar than would be reached simply by looking at the rate against the US dollar (or even the TWI which is heavily influenced by the US dollar rate). ", " In the first four months of 2001, the RBA bought about $1 billion of Australian dollars in the market to provide a steadying influence at times when the exchange rate was under strong downward pressure. It also sold <span class=\"no-wrap\">$1.4 billion</span> of foreign exchange to the Commonwealth Government. Other transactions (including interest receipts) resulted in outright purchases of foreign exchange of $1.3 billion. The total of the above transactions was a fall of about $1.1 billion in net reserves. Valuation effects worked in the opposite direction, adding <span class=\"no-wrap\">$1.0                                          billion</span>, with the result that net reserves in Australian dollar terms have declined marginally in 2001, to about <span class=\"no-wrap\">$8.9 billion</span>. ", " The RBA has so far this year acquired $3.4 billion of foreign exchange under swap transactions undertaken for domestic liquidity management. The main purpose of these transactions was to provide Australian dollars to domestic banks to replace funds withdrawn by the Commonwealth budget surplus. In past years, this would normally have been done by buying government securities from banks, but the low supply of these now limits the amount which the RBA can acquire. It therefore supplies Australian dollars to the market on a swap basis in exchange for US dollars. Swaps outstanding now stand at $28 billion. When added to the RBA's net reserve position, this lifts gross reserves to around $37 billion, compared with $34 billion at the start of the year. ", " The December quarter national accounts show that the Australian economy contracted slightly over the second half of 2000 following a number of years of strong growth (Graph 23). To a large extent, this result can be attributed to developments in dwelling investment, which subtracted more than 2 percentage points from GDP growth over the second half of the year after having contributed 1 percentage point to growth over the first half of the year. The surprisingly sharp swing in dwelling investment largely reflected the introduction of the new tax system in the middle of 2000, which provided an incentive to shift housing construction activity into the first half of the year. Broadly similar patterns in construction activity were evident across states, leading to a marked weakening in final demand growth in each state in the second half of 2000. ", " Even after abstracting from dwelling investment, however, it is clear that domestic demand slowed in the second half of 2000. This may have reflected the important linkages that the construction sector has with other parts of the economy, especially manufacturing, and other disruptions arising from the change in taxation arrangements and the Olympic Games. Rising petrol prices and increases in the interest burden of both the household and business sectors may have also been important. Together, these factors contributed to a weakening in confidence, and showed up in weaker consumer spending and some deferral of investment plans in the second half of 2000. Net exports, however, added significantly to growth during the second half of the year, as did inventory accumulation (Table 4). ", " Economic conditions remained subdued through the first few months of 2001. Within the housing sector, the leading indicators suggest a pick-up in activity in coming months, although activity probably remained fairly weak through the March quarter. While retail trade picked up through the summer, consumer sentiment deteriorated sharply in March and remained low in April, implying that there is a risk of weakness in consumer spending in the period ahead. Overall, the business surveys have implied that conditions have remained weak; these have not, however, pointed to a significant deterioration in conditions from those recorded a few months ago. The level of the exchange rate is supportive of exports. ", " Consumer spending grew at a more moderate pace in 2000 relative to previous years, increasing by 2½ per cent over the year to the December quarter, compared with growth of around 5¼ per cent over the previous year. The slowing in spending was particularly noticeable on clothing and footwear, on the operation of motor vehicles, and at hotels, cafés and restaurants, and was concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria. Consistent with the relative price changes associated with the tax changes, in the second half of 2000 the share of consumer spending on goods and services whose price rose the most (such as clothing and footwear, accommodation, and café and restaurant meals) fell relative to those items experiencing falls in price (such as motor vehicles). Although the pattern of consumption has changed, in aggregate the effects of the tax changes on the timing of consumption expenditures have been small. ", " More recently, the value of retail sales, which accounts for about one-third of consumption expenditure, has accelerated, increasing by 3.4 per cent over the three months to February and by more than 8 per cent over <span class=\"no-wrap\">the year (Graph 24)</span>. In part, this may have reflected an increase in price growth. Sales of food, recreational goods and products from department stores have increased strongly, while sales of household goods and spending on hospitality and services have been weak. This pick-up in sales has been fairly evenly spread across states, with the notable exception of Western Australia, where sales have been very weak. Sales of motor vehicles, in contrast, have fallen in the March quarter, following very strong growth during the second half of last year, and have returned to around the average level recorded during the past few years. ", " A number of factors are likely to have contributed to the slowdown in consumption growth during 2000. Increased expenditure on petrol due to higher prices probably led to a reduction in real consumer spending in other areas. Petrol prices increased by around 24 per cent over the year to the December quarter, implying that in real terms, the price of fuel faced by Australian consumers has been higher than at any time since the Gulf War. With households, on average, spending around 3 per cent of their total consumption expenditure on fuel, and having only a limited ability to substitute in the short term (for example by travelling shorter distances, taking public transport or buying more fuel-efficient cars), the rise in petrol prices could have reduced aggregate consumption over the year by up to ¾ of a percentage point, depending on the household sector's capacity to use savings to pay for the higher fuel costs. ", " The household interest burden also rose noticeably over 2000, from a little over 6 per cent to just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span>, its highest level since the early 1990s. This reflected increases in interest rates and continued strong growth in borrowing by households. The cumulative 125 basis point cut in official interest rates in 2001, however, implies that the household interest burden will have declined in recent months. ", " In previous years, strong growth in consumption had been supported by strong growth in the value of household assets, driven by both dwelling and equity price increases. During the past year, however, little increase in the value of household assets was recorded (Table 5). A deceleration in growth was evident across most asset classes, with the turnaround in the measured value of dwellings particularly pronounced. Through 2000, measures of dwelling prices were affected by compositional changes caused by the introduction of the first homebuyers' grant, but all available measures suggest a marked slowing in dwelling price growth from earlier years. Growth in the value of household financial assets also slowed, primarily reflecting slower growth in the value of equity holdings. However, growth rates remained positive, in contrast to the US where the value of household direct equity holdings fell by 25 per cent over the year to December. ", " These dampening influences were partly offset by the boost to household income from the tax cuts and social benefit increases associated with the new tax system. Over the second half of 2000 these changes boosted disposable income by about $3.8 billion and more than offset the increase in prices over the period. However, with growth of compensation of employees slowing in line with the weakening labour market and lower profitability in the unincorporated sector, real household disposable income recorded little growth over the second half of 2000, though at year's end, income was still 3 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 25). The household saving ratio fell over the second half of the year, after drifting higher during the preceding couple of years. Periods of slower income growth are often associated with a fall in the household saving ratio, although to the extent that consumption has been encouraged in recent years by buoyant asset price growth, the more subdued market conditions of late may have provided households with a greater incentive to save. ", " The above factors, combined with news about overall economic conditions, the exchange rate and interest rates, contributed to considerable swings in consumer sentiment over the course of the year. According to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute's consumer sentiment index, sentiment improved markedly after the introduction of the GST, before easing to around long-run average levels. Early in 2001, however, sentiment again fell sharply <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 24)</span>. This followed the release of the weak national accounts reading for the December quarter and the subsequent weakening of the exchange rate, and occurred despite the easing in official interest rates. ", " Household indebtedness grew broadly in line with annualised household income in the December quarter, maintaining the ratio of household debt to disposable income around 105 per cent (Graph 26). The ongoing increase in indebtedness, combined with more subdued growth in assets, has slightly increased the ratio of debt to assets of the household sector. ", " Dwelling investment contracted sharply in the second half of 2000. In the December quarter, dwelling construction activity, as a share of real GDP, fell to its lowest level in 40 years, after achieving its highest level in <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 years</span> just two quarters earlier <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 27)</span>. The sharp turnaround was evident in spending on both new construction and alterations and additions. The effect of tax reform on the timing of housing construction was much more significant in Australia than in other countries that have recently introduced a value-added tax <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 28)</span>. ", " All states experienced a boost to construction activity in the first half of 2000 followed by a substantial contraction in activity in the second half. In the case of New South Wales, and to a lesser extent Western Australia, the contraction in activity followed an extended period in which activity had been running at a high level. For the other states, the run-up in activity was concentrated in the first half of 2000. ", " To date, there is little evidence at an aggregate level of significant over-building of dwellings during the recent upswing. According to the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA), vacancy rates, after drifting higher following the mid-1990s boom in dwelling investment, have been fairly steady in most capital cities, although in Perth there have been some signs of an increase. Investment in medium-density dwellings has, however, been at a high level for several years, and most of this activity has been concentrated in NSW and Victoria. It is possible that the recent concentration of activity has resulted in some degree of over-building in some areas. ", " The precise timing of the recovery in dwelling investment remains unclear. Near-term indicators of dwelling investment are at low levels with lending approvals for new dwellings, building approvals and commencements remaining close to their recent troughs (Graph 29). On the basis of these figures, the possibility of a further fall in dwelling investment having occurred in the March quarter cannot be ruled out. ", " Despite this near-term uncertainty, recent developments in the housing market overall are quite favourable for dwelling construction activity in the period ahead. Loan approvals for owner-occupiers' purchases of established dwellings and newly erected dwellings have picked up sharply in recent months and have recovered much of the post-GST fall (Graph 30). (On average, the market for established houses leads the new construction market by three to four months.) More generally, the improvement in affordability driven by recent falls in interest rates, and the extension to the First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) scheme should spur growth in construction over the remainder of 2001. Indeed, survey data published by the Housing Industry Association suggest a very substantial increase in sales of new homes occurred in March after the extension of the FHOG scheme. ", " Within the business sector, the effects of the sharp swings in dwelling investment and the staging of the Olympic Games in September/October have been clearly evident. In the second half of 2000, weakness was concentrated in the construction and manufacturing sectors, with those parts of the manufacturing sector with strong links to the housing sector, notably wood and paper production, recording particularly weak outcomes. Output in the recreation and culture sector, which was boosted by the recording of the Olympic Games in the September quarter, fell significantly in the December quarter. On the positive side, business and property services, and health and community services continued to expand, and the mining sector reported one of the strongest increases in production, at around 10 per cent over the year. ", " In recent months, business surveys have continued to report weak business conditions across many sectors of the economy. The business conditions indices in the quarterly NAB survey, which covers a broad range of industries, have remained slightly below the levels prevailing in the mid-1990s slowdown, but are considerably above the levels prevailing in the early-1990s recession. Some variation in conditions across industries is evident in the industry breakdown provided by the NAB survey (Graph 31). Business conditions for the construction industry, for example, have deteriorated most markedly over the last twelve months to well below long-run average levels. On the other hand, conditions in the mining sector have improved sharply over the past couple of years and are well above long-run average levels. The deterioration in business conditions across most other industries over the past year has been broadly similar, although conditions remain only a little below long-run average levels. Other surveys, such as the ACCI-Westpac survey, which covers the manufacturing sector, and the Dun and Bradstreet survey, which covers the retail trade, wholesale trade and transport sectors, have exhibited similar trends. ", " The evidence suggests that the recent fall in sales and business confidence has been more pronounced for the small business sector than for medium and large businesses (Graph 32). (See <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a> for a discussion of the employment and output composition of the small business sector.) The ABS quarterly survey of business expectations has reported falls in expected operating income for the small business sector for the last four quarters, whereas the rate of growth of expected operating income for large firms, although weaker, has remained positive. The Yellow Pages survey of small businesses has also reported a more marked deterioration in confidence than most other surveys, with the net balance in recent quarters being at the lowest level since the survey commenced in 1993. ", " The Yellow Pages survey provides some indication of the source of small business concerns. The most commonly identified concern is a lack of work or sales. In part, this may reflect the small business sector's disproportionately large share in the construction, manufacturing and retail trade sectors. Output of these three industries fell by more than 7 per cent over the second half of 2000, compared with a rise of 2 per cent for other industries. The Yellow Pages survey has also reported an increase in the number of respondents citing government regulations and taxes as a prime concern over the last year and a half, although these concerns eased considerably in the latest survey. ", " Overall, these surveys have suggested that apprehension about demand, given the weakening in economic conditions, combined with the transitional effects of bedding down the new taxation system, may have led to some compression in profit margins. This has been reflected in aggregate measures of profitability for the unincorporated sector, which have also been weak, with GOS of the unincorporated sector falling by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in December to be just 1 per cent higher over the year (Graph 33). Although GOS of the unincorporated sector is not estimated at an industry level, the recent fall probably reflects declines in profitability in the retail trade and residential construction sectors. ", " For the corporate sector, aggregate measures of profitability have also fallen. GOS of the corporate sector declined in the December quarter, although it remained 7 per cent higher than a year earlier and, as a proportion of GDP, profits remained above long-run average levels. At an industry level, the ABS Company Profits Survey suggested that the mining sector has continued to benefit from the low exchange rate, with profits growing by 5½ per cent in the December quarter to be more than 30 per cent higher over the year. In contrast, manufacturing profits fell by 7½ per cent in the quarter, following little growth over the previous few quarters. ", " The decline in profitability and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook were reflected in subdued investment spending in the December quarter. New business investment fell by just over 3 per cent, reflecting significant falls in machinery and equipment and non-dwelling construction activity. Investment in machinery and equipment fell by 5½ per cent in the December quarter, but was around 11 per cent higher than a year ago. It continues to exhibit volatility from quarter to quarter, a pattern seen since the beginning of 1999. The short-term outlook for investment in machinery and equipment, as measured in the latest ABS Capital Expenditure Survey, has been revised down, and implies only modest growth for the remainder of 2000/01. However the first estimate for 2001/02, while only indicative of likely developments, implies a marked rebound in capital expenditure next year. Strong growth in investment is expected to come from the utilities, property and business services, communications and mining sectors. ", " New investment in buildings and structures has continued to decline from the peak levels reached two years ago, falling by nearly 3 per cent in the December quarter. The first rise in engineering construction in a year and a half was more than offset by a fall in building activity. Forward indicators for non-residential building activity point to little growth in construction work over the remainder of 2000/01. Non-residential building approvals are only slightly above their average level of last year, while the value of building projects under construction, as measured in the Access Economics Property Monitor, fell to its lowest level since 1996. The longer-term outlook for office construction (around 20 per cent of building activity) is somewhat brighter, underpinned by a gradual tightening in market conditions. According to the Property Council of Australia, CBD office vacancy rates fell in most capital cities in the six months to January 2001, as a result of continued strong absorption of office space. Given the long lead times for these major construction projects, however, a recovery in this market is not expected to boost growth in the near term. ", " Other private business investment (mainly expenditure on computer software but also on mining exploration) increased by 4½ per cent in the December quarter to be nearly 14 per cent higher than a year earlier, suggesting that companies were continuing to invest in information technology. Private expenditure on petroleum exploration also rose significantly, and expectations reported for the six months ended June 2001 suggest that this pattern is likely to continue. Such a pattern would be consistent with the high levels of commodity prices in Australian dollar terms, and the fact that the mining sector is currently operating at very high levels. ", " In aggregate, business financing activity in the form of both debt and equity has been subdued early in 2001. Although business credit growth picked up in the March quarter, the pattern of growth, with strong growth in February easing in March, is consistent with some of the increased borrowing being used for tax payment purposes. This has also been implied by recent business surveys and liaison with banks. The measured corporate net interest burden rose in the second half of 2000, although compared with earlier episodes, the debt-servicing burden remains at very low levels for both the corporate and unincorporated sectors (Graph 34). Recent falls in interest rates should result in a fall in these debt-servicing ratios in coming quarters. ", " The recent slowing in output growth has seen the labour market weaken significantly over the last two quarters, following the strong conditions prevailing over the past couple of years (Graph 35). Employment grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span> in the March quarter, recovering almost half of the fall in the December quarter, to be 1.6 per cent higher than a year earlier. The recovery in the March quarter was wholly in part-time employment, with the number of persons employed on a full-time basis continuing to decline. The reduced demand for labour has seen the unemployment rate rise by ½ a percentage point from the recent low to 6.5 per cent in the March quarter. (These data incorporate revisions to the Labour Force Survey data, released in early May, which have reduced the unemployment rate by around ¼ of a percentage point.) ", " These aggregate data disguise a marked variation in outcomes across industries, occupations and regions. Overall, robust demand for professionals and office workers has been offset by reduced demand for tradespersons and labourers. Not surprisingly, the construction industry has driven the recent weakening in employment outcomes. Over the six months to February, employment in construction fell by 48,300, while in the rest of the economy it grew by 40,800 (Graph 36). ", " The recent decline in output has also affected employment in a range of traditionally cyclically sensitive industries, including wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing. In contrast, high levels of labour demand have persisted in most service industries. Employment in the property and business services sector, for example, has grown by over 120,000 over the past year and by more than 30,000 in the March quarter, with strong growth in employment in the accounting, legal and information-technology areas. ", " The labour market has weakened, to varying degrees, in every state over the past six months. New South Wales has experienced one of the most pronounced contractions, while employment growth has remained strongest in Victoria and Western Australia (Table 6). ", " The different labour market conditions in the states have largely reflected differences in their exposure to the downturn in the construction industry (Table 7). Employment increased most rapidly in New South Wales prior to the September quarter 2000, but has fallen by almost 35,000 over the past two quarters, driven by a loss of construction jobs. Weakness in the construction sector has also been a key factor in the relatively weak labour market outcome in Queensland. These two states have also experienced floods, and around half of the jobs lost in the agricultural industry in NSW occurred in flood-affected local government areas. In contrast, Victoria has been less exposed to the downturn in the construction industry and, in fact, has achieved small gains in construction employment over the past year. Furthermore, strong employment growth has been recorded in Victoria in a range of service industries, both business-related services and those connected to the public sector. Consistent with the relative strength of the labour market in Victoria, that state has been experiencing net inflows of interstate migrants for the first time in many decades. ", " Growth in labour productivity has eased over the past couple of years, from a rate of around 3½ per cent two years ago, to around ¾ of a per cent over the year to the December quarter 2000 (Graph 37). Measures of labour productivity growth, however, vary quite considerably across the business cycle, given variations in the lags between employment and economic activity, so changes in the longer-term trend rate of productivity growth are not readily discernible from these data. To date, the easing in labour productivity growth appears similar to the cyclical slowing that occurred in the mid 1990s. ", " Most forward-looking indicators of labour demand suggest that employment will be weak over the next couple of quarters. Both the ANZ Bank and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) measures of vacancies indicate that the number of jobs advertised in newspapers continues to fall quite sharply and is now a third below the peak in May 2000 (Graph 38). According to the DEWRSB measure, most of the fall in vacancies over the past year has been the result of a sharp decline in the level of advertising of positions related to the construction sector and, to a lesser extent, in manufacturing. The continuing decline in advertisements for tradespersons, which are now at a low level, suggests a comparatively weak employment outlook for this occupational grouping in the short term. Advertising for professionals, in contrast, has been considerably stronger, and although a fall was recorded in April, it remains at an historically high level. ", " The recent divergence between trends in the number of jobs advertised in newspapers and the number of job vacancies as measured by the ABS has been partially resolved following revisions to the ABS vacancies data. The ABS data now show that vacancies peaked in February 2000 and have since declined by 15 per cent. This fall, however, remains considerably less than that recorded by the newspaper-based vacancies series. This may reflect the nature of the ABS survey: since it is a survey of employers' direct hiring intentions, it is less representative of employment developments in industries in which sub-contracting is prevalent and self-employed workers are highly represented. This is clearly relevant for the construction industry, and may help to explain why the ABS reports that vacancies in this industry have been flat over the year to February, while the DEWRSB skilled vacancies measure of job advertisements (which includes advertisements for construction sub-contractors) reported a fall of around 75 per cent over the same period. The recent declines in the ABS vacancies measure have been most pronounced in the manufacturing and retail trade sectors, and have been broadly consistent with movements in employment in these sectors. ", " The major surveys of business expectations also point to a subdued outlook for the labour market. The quarterly NAB survey reported that employment intentions continued to decline into the June quarter 2001, while the ACCI-Westpac survey indicated that employment intentions in the manufacturing sector improved slightly in the quarter, although they remain quite soft. Although employment intentions remain near their lowest levels in recent years, at present they are considerably more buoyant than those prevailing immediately prior to the early-1990s recession. ", " The external sector has provided a considerable impetus to the economy over the past year, contributing one percentage point to the growth in GDP over the year to the December quarter 2000. Strong world growth and a low exchange rate boosted export volumes, while a slowing in domestic demand and the lower exchange rate retarded growth in imports. The terms of trade have also moved favourably, increasing to their highest level in ten years. The trade balance recorded a trade surplus of $212 million in the March quarter, or around <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.1 per cent</span> of GDP <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 39)</span>. Assuming the net income deficit is steady as a share of GDP, the current account deficit in the March quarter is likely to have fallen below 3 per cent of GDP, from the peak of 6 per cent recorded in the middle of 1999. In the period ahead, the external sector will be affected by the opposing forces of a more subdued outlook for world growth and the low exchange rate. ", " The value of exports increased by more than 17 per cent over the year to the March quarter. The slight fall in the March quarter reflected a number of factors including adverse weather affecting the supply of rural exports and the slowdown in growth in the world economy. The fall in the quarter was spread across all major destinations, but was smallest to east Asia (excluding Japan) (Graph 40). Over the past year, exports to east Asia have recorded the fastest pace of growth so that the share of exports to this region has risen from 31 per cent of total merchandise exports to 36 per cent over the past two years. Much of this growth has been in resource exports, particularly petroleum, metals and iron ore. ", " The value of rural exports fell by around 3 per cent in the March quarter to be 16 per cent higher than a year earlier <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 41)</span>. A decline in cereal exports, largely a result of unfavourable weather conditions, accounted for much of the fall in the quarter. In south east Queensland and northern New South Wales, extremely wet weather around harvest time resulted in a substantial downgrading of the quality of the harvest. Despite the recent decline, the outlook for the rural sector is positive. Export receipts for a range of Australian products are likely to rise in response to agricultural trade restrictions now imposed on countries afflicted with foot-and-mouth disease. ", " After increasing strongly over the previous year and a half, the value of resource exports declined a little in the March quarter, as a fall in prices received more than offset solid growth in export volumes. Exports of many resource commodities remain at high levels despite the recent slowing, resulting in a run-down in inventories. Some areas of the mining industry may be approaching full capacity, which may limit the growth in resource exports volumes in the period ahead. ", " The low level of the exchange rate has boosted manufactured exports, although more recently, weaker trading partner growth has contributed to a slowing in the rate of growth. The value of manufactured exports rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the March quarter to be 18 per cent higher than a year earlier. An increase in exports of manufactures such as motor vehicles more than offset a fall in the value of machinery and equipment exports in the quarter. ", " Following the Olympics-related surge in overseas arrivals in September, the value of service exports has fallen over the past two quarters. Overseas arrivals are still above their pre-Olympics level, however, with a decline in the number of visitors from the US and Europe being partially offset by a recovery in tourist arrivals from east Asia and New Zealand. Within east Asia, arrivals from China, Korea and Singapore have been particularly strong in recent months. ", " The value of imports of goods and services fell in the March quarter, driven primarily by a weakening in domestic demand. The largest fall was in imports of capital goods (Graph 42). Consumption imports had grown strongly over the second half of 2000, supported by firm growth in the volume of motor vehicle imports. More recently, however, that effect has been unwinding, with the value of motor vehicle imports falling by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> in the March quarter, accounting for the majority of the fall in the value of consumption imports in the quarter. The value of intermediate imports has fallen, following a sharp oil-related rise in 2000. Service imports rose marginally in the March quarter and are around 10 per cent higher over the year. Reflecting the effect of the low exchange rate on the cost of overseas travel, the volume of travel services declined over 2000. ", " The net income deficit widened slightly in the December quarter to around 3 per cent of GDP. The trend since the mid 1990s, however, has been for the net income deficit to narrow, reflecting in part the falling differential between debt yields in Australia and other countries. Combined with strong growth in exports, this has resulted in the ratio of net interest payments to exports falling to around 9 per cent, from around 12 per cent in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 1990s</span>. ", " Australia's net foreign debt increased by 2 per cent in the December quarter to just over $300 billion, or <span class=\"no-wrap\">46 per cent</span> of GDP. Net equity liabilities rose by a greater margin in the quarter, reflecting the valuation effect of the stronger performance of the Australian stock market relative to those abroad. The ABS has substantially revised the value of Australians' holdings of equities abroad to more accurately reflect their market value. This had the effect of lowering the level of Australia's total net foreign liabilities as a proportion of GDP by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 percentage</span> points in the September quarter, with revisions to the level in earlier years too. Australia's net foreign liabilities are now estimated to be 58 per cent of GDP. ", " Over 2000, net capital inflows were predominantly in the form of debt rather than equity (Table 8). One factor underpinning this shift in the past two years has been the increased volume of portfolio investment by Australians in foreign equities while portfolio equity inflows have also declined. ", " The Bank's index of commodity prices increased by around 1½ per cent in foreign-currency terms in the three months to April, to be about 7 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year (Graph 43). In Australian dollar terms, the increase has been much greater, with the index increasing by around 6 per cent in the three months to April and by 22 per cent over the year. Commodity prices, in Australian dollar terms, are at their highest level in more than two decades. Rural prices have accounted for much of the recent increase, along with higher coal prices. In contrast, base metal prices have been adversely affected by the downturn in the world economy. ", " The rise in rural prices has been broad-based. Wool prices rose by around 8 per cent in foreign-currency terms in the three months to April, mainly reflecting stronger demand from China. Beef and veal prices have increased by around 10 per cent in the three months to April, following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the major beef-exporting countries of Europe and South America. Sugar prices fell by around 5 per cent in the three months to April, reflecting weaker than expected demand from Russia, though they are still 70 per cent higher than a year earlier. The price of cotton has fallen by about 14 per cent in the past three months on expectations that the 2001 worldwide harvest will be the largest in over a decade. ", " Recently negotiated contracts have delivered large rises in the prices of iron ore and some forms of coal. For the Japanese fiscal year beginning in April, US dollar prices of iron ore increased by an average of 3 to 4 per cent. Coking coal prices have increased by about 8½ percent over the year, while steaming coal prices have increased to an even greater extent. Strong Asian demand and tight supply in the region have seen the average price of steaming coal rise by around 20 per cent in US dollar terms and by 36 per cent in Australian dollars over the past year. These increases will be reflected in Australia's export prices from the June quarter. ", " Reflecting the slowdown in global industrial production, base metal prices were unchanged in the March quarter, and have fallen by around 2½ per cent over the year (Graph 44). An exception to this is the price of aluminium, which has remained firm as smelter closures in the US have caused production to fall more quickly than demand. ", " Oil prices have drifted lower over the past few months, with the price of West Texas intermediate now trading at around US$27–28 per barrel. The weaker outlook for world growth has been the major factor, though the effect of this has been countered by threats by OPEC to reduce production. OPEC members have only cut production once this year – agreeing in March to reduce production by about one million barrels per day. ", " At the short end of the yield curve, attention has focused on reductions in the cash rate by the RBA. The three monetary easings (50 points in February, 25 points in March and 50 points in April) reduced the cash rate to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span>, only marginally above its two previous cyclical lows. ", " The easings in February and March had been anticipated by markets and fully priced into yields by the time they were announced. In the case of the April easing this was less so, as the market was divided as to whether that reduction would be 25 or 50 points. When the larger figure was announced, there was consequently some further fall in market yields. Looking at the overall movement in the year to date, short-term market yields have broadly fallen by the same amount as the cash rate (Graph 45). ", " The current structure of the yield curve at the short end suggests that markets, as at the time of writing, were expecting some further easings in monetary policy in the months ahead. These expectations were scaled back somewhat after the release of the higher-than-expected CPI result for the March quarter, but still incorporate a view that the cash rate will level out at around 4.5 per cent in the second half of the year. This is a higher level than the expected Fed funds rate in the second half of the year, which is around 4 per cent. ", " Yields at the long end have taken a somewhat different course. In the middle of 2000, they had been around 6.25 per cent, broadly in line with the cash rate and short-term yields. They then fell quite sharply during the December quarter (largely in line with US bond yields) and were around 5.5 per cent by the end of that quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 46)</span>. They then fell further during the March quarter, reaching a low of just below 5 per cent in mid March, similar to the low reached in 1998 after the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of the hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management. ", " Since mid March, however, even though short rates have fallen further, bond yields have risen quite noticeably, back to December quarter levels. As with the earlier fall, this rise seemed mainly due to US market developments, but also appeared to indicate a diminished concern among markets about the downturn in the domestic economy. ", " The differential between Australian and US bonds generally traded in the range of 10–50 points over the past nine months (Graphs 47 and 48). On average, this was similar to the spread over the past three years, and well below historical norms when Australian inflation substantially exceeded that in the US. In recent weeks, the bond spread has tended to trade around the top end of the range noted above, and on some days somewhat above it. This mainly reflected a view that economic activity in Australia would prove to be more robust than in the US, though the relatively high CPI outcome for the March quarter also seemed to add to the spread, indicating that it may have had some (albeit small) impact on inflationary expectations. ", " Each of the easings of monetary policy has been passed on very quickly, and in full, to housing borrowers. The pass-through to business loans has been less quick, and in some cases not quite in full. Credit card rates have fallen by much less than the fall in the cash rate. Table 9 summarises movements in the main lending rates charged by intermediaries following the easing in monetary policy of recent months, and the current levels of these rates. ", " Banks, building societies and mortgage managers have passed on to housing borrowers the full 125 basis point easing in policy (see Graph 49). These cuts have reduced the average standard-variable housing rate of banks to 6.80 per cent, only about 30 basis points higher than the level at the cyclical low of 1999 and almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 percentage</span> points below the cyclical low in 1993/94. The easings have been passed on to existing housing borrowers much more quickly than in the past, and on average more quickly than banks passed on the tightenings of 1999 and 2000. ", " Reductions in rates on home equity loans have been slightly less than the cut in the cash rate, as lenders which used to have rates below average have moderated their reductions to bring their rates into line with competitors. ", " Major banks have passed on only partially interest rate reductions to credit card borrowers. The average interest rate on credit cards (with an interest-free period) is currently 16.00 per cent, a cut of <span class=\"no-wrap\">70 basis points</span> since early 2001. Cuts in rates to business borrowers have, on average, been slightly less than the reductions in the cash rate. As with home equity loans, this reflects the fact that some banks that had been charging relatively low rates have brought them more into line with their competitors. In recent months, small business has generally also had to wait longer than households to see the benefits of cuts in the cash rate. ", " While business variable-rate loans have moved with the cash rate, interest rates on fixed-rate loans have tracked longer-term rates in capital markets. The 3-year fixed rate for business loans has fallen by just over 200 basis points since its peak in early 2000; this rate has moved up in recent weeks as yields in capital markets have increased. Almost half of small business borrowing is undertaken at fixed rates. ", " Taking a longer view of developments in finance for small business, interest rates have fallen noticeably, in a structural sense as opposed to cyclically, as banks' margins on these loans have been substantially reduced. The margin between the average interest rate on small business variable-rate loans and the cash rate has almost halved since the mid 1990s, falling from 6.15 per cent in mid 1994, to 3.35 per cent. A major factor in this reduced margin is the migration of borrowing to newly-available low-cost loans, particularly residentially-secured loans. This structural fall in margins meant that, at the peak in rates in the second half of 2000, the average rate paid by small businesses remained 1.5 percentage points below the mid-1990s low point, even though the cash rate was <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.5 percentage</span> points higher. ", " Over the past few months issuance of debt securities by non-government entities has continued at the strong pace seen over the past two years, with net issuance averaging $5.5 billion per quarter since the beginning of 1999. This continued strong growth in the non-government bond market has meant that the level of non-government bonds outstanding, at $89 billion, now substantially exceeds the amount of Commonwealth bonds on issue and is close to the peak in the size of Commonwealth Government bond outstandings ($95 billion) seen in 1997 (Graph 50). ", " Table 10 shows the composition of gross new issuance in the non-government debt market in recent years. Corporate issuance in the first quarter of 2001 was the lowest since the September quarter 1999, with a large fall in new bond issues by former state-owned utilities. Debt issuance by financial institutions has been higher than the average seen in previous years, and non-resident issuance into the domestic market was particularly strong. The large amount of non-resident issuance was influenced by the low cost of raising funds in Australia and swapping into US dollars. For most of this year, this was cheaper for issuers than the cost of approaching the US markets directly. ", " Offshore bond issuance by Australian residents was $7.8 billion in the March quarter. These issues are still larger than domestic issues, but growing at a slower rate (Graph 51). The main issuers to tap the offshore market continue to be financial institutions and, more recently, asset-backed vehicles. Non-financial corporates have had no significant presence in this market since 1999. ", " The average credit rating of new issues of corporate bonds (excluding asset-backed issues) rose somewhat in the March quarter 2001, to AA− from A in the December quarter. This strengthening of average credit quality is a slight reversal of the longer-term trend, which has reflected a broadening in the range of companies that are now able to raise funds in the domestic bond market, rather than any deterioration of credit quality among corporations. ", " The maturity profile of issuance in the latest quarter has been around the middle of the corporate yield curve (maturities between four to six years), a little longer than was the case in the second half of last year. This movement to longer-dated securities went hand-in-hand with the slight rise in the average credit quality of issuers; it remains the case that better-rated companies are able to issue longer-term securities. ", " The Australian equity market continues to be quite steady by world standards. The ASX 200 index has generally been flat over the past year, a period when most other industrial country share markets have fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">10–30 per cent</span> (Graph 52). ", " The resource sector has been particularly strong, reaching a record high in April. Share prices of these companies have risen 12 per cent so far this calendar year, reflecting the continuing boost to export revenues provided by the low exchange rate and also recent rises in metals prices, particularly for aluminium and copper. ", " Earnings forecasts for Australian companies have been downgraded more quickly this year than is normally the case. Analysts' forecasts of growth in earnings per share for the ‘all industrials’ sector are now below the growth recorded in 2000, though, at 6 per cent, the forecast increase is still substantial (Graph 53). Estimates for earnings growth in 2002 have also been downgraded, but nonetheless remain high, at 14 per cent. This suggests that the share market analysts are expecting a rapid recovery in economic activity. The market-wide price/earnings (P/E) ratio has fallen from its peak last year of 29, to the low 20s at present (Graph 54). This is, however, still well above the long-run average of 15. ", " Margin lending by banks and brokers for the purchase of shares grew by 9 per cent in the six months to March, down from over 20 per cent in the same period last year. The number of clients with margin loans rose slightly, but total borrowing limits were scaled back by almost 20 per cent. The average leverage ratio (ratio of loans to value of shares or managed funds held as collateral) has changed little over the past year at around 50 per cent and remains well below the maximum rate of 70 per cent that lenders say they will make available for ‘blue chip’ shares. The number of clients receiving a margin call increased during the March quarter, reflecting the volatility in share prices seen in recent months, but remains at a low level. ", " So far this year, the corporate sector has raised $608 million through initial public offerings, around half the amount raised in the same period last year. The volatility of the share market and the poor performance of a number of recent initial public offerings have meant that several proposed floats have now been either cancelled or postponed. ", " As noted in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial                                          Markets</a>’, monetary policy has been eased during 2001 in response to the changing balance of risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. Taken together with other indicators, this suggests that financial conditions are relatively expansionary at present. Interest rates are below average and near previous cyclical lows. The yield curve has returned to having its customary upward slope. Credit growth remains moderate to strong, and the exchange rate is low compared with historical experience. ", " The cash rate has been reduced by 1¼ percentage points since the beginning of the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 55)</span>. This reduction has been less than the reduction in US rates, but more than in other English-speaking countries (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International Financial and                                          Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’). The reduction in the cash rate also has been more rapid this easing cycle than in 1996–97 when the first three reductions in rates were spread over six months. The favourable outlook for inflation has permitted the stance of monetary policy to shift quickly to one that is supportive of domestic economic activity. ", " Much commentary focuses on changes in interest rates, but in any assessment of the effect monetary policy is likely to be exerting on the economy, it is more important to focus on the <em>level</em> of interest rates. In so doing, some notion of whether the level of rates is high or low relative to a benchmark is required. For practical purposes, the Bank has tended to regard the average level of interest rates over the period in which inflation has been low – since 1992 – as a rough benchmark. Over that period the economy has recorded good growth on average and inflation has not had a noticeable trend in either direction. ", " On this measure, it is reasonably clear that the stance of monetary policy is expansionary as a result of the declines in interest rates in 2001. Measures of both the nominal and real cash rate are below their respective average levels of recent years, and are close to the two previous cyclical lows. Rates charged by financial intermediaries are now noticeably lower in real terms than the average over the past decade, reflecting the reduction in the real cash rate and the compression in interest margins over recent years. ", " These measures of real interest rates are only approximations, in that actual past inflation is used as a proxy for expectations of future inflation, which are not easily observable. (See <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2001/feb/1.html#box-b\">Box B</a> of the February 2001 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> for a discussion of real interest rates.) In using them, account must therefore be taken of the possibility that inflation expectations and actual inflation may not be related in the same way as in the past. It is quite possible, for example, that inflation expectations are lower and better anchored now than was the case in the past, given that average inflation has been low for a number of years now. In this case, the true level of real interest rates might be slightly higher than estimated. ", " The difference between long rates – set by the market – and short-term rates, which are dominated by the central bank's policy actions, can provide another gauge of the stance of policy. Over recent months, rates further out along the yield curve have returned to being above those at the short end, as short rates have fallen and long rates have risen. Long-term rates are now around 100 basis points higher than short-term rates, which is a more common relationship than the inverted yield curve which prevailed late in 2000 (Graph 56). This appears to reflect a collective view among market participants that the uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are starting to abate. This is, of course, an indication of current market views, and could change as new information becomes available. Nonetheless, it does suggest that policy settings are expansionary, though perhaps slightly less so than in 1999. ", " Growth in the monetary aggregates accelerated in the March quarter after weakening in the latter half of 2000, with the wider aggregates, M3 and broad money, growing at the fastest quarterly pace for some time. Prominent in the pick-up in growth of intermediaries' domestic deposit liabilities have been certificates of deposit, issuance of which has probably been encouraged by the significant fall in short-term interest rates. Among funding sources not counted in the monetary aggregates, domestic bond issuance remained solid in the face of moderately lower bond yields, and borrowing from foreigners continued at a strong pace. ", " At an annualised rate of 9 per cent in the six months to March, credit growth has eased a little along with the decline in growth in the economy, but remains within the range experienced for most of the 1990s expansion <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 57)</span>. Measured on a shorter-term basis, credit growth in fact picked up a little in the March quarter, underpinned by stronger business borrowing, in part reflecting borrowing to fund tax payments. Households continue to borrow at a faster pace than businesses, although the composition of household borrowing has shifted, with a slowdown in the pace of personal lending offsetting continued strong borrowing for housing. Overall, the pace of growth of money and credit can be described as moderate to strong. Lack of access to credit is unlikely to be constraining investment or consumption decisions. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International                                          and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar has risen in recent weeks, although it remains quite low both against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. An assessment of the influence on the economy of the depreciation can be gauged by measures of the real exchange rate, which adjust for differences in inflation rates across countries. Given that inflation in Australia and most major trading partners has remained comparably low in recent years, however, the nominal depreciation over the past year has translated into a real depreciation of around the same magnitude. ", " Graph 58 shows that on a trade-weighted inflation-adjusted basis, the real exchange rate has fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span> over the year to the March quarter, to be 13½ per cent below its 1990s average and around historically low levels. Alternative measures of the real exchange rate, such as those compiled by the IMF and the OECD, also show a marked depreciation over the recent period. ", " Assessing the significance of the exchange rate for the purposes of monetary policy is complicated by the problem that some exchange rate changes occur in response to shifts in the ‘real’ trade fundamentals facing the economy. However, there seems little doubt that the current level of the real exchange rate confers on Australian exporting and import-competing companies a significant price advantage over comparable foreign firms. These conditions are supportive of continued strong growth in the traded sector of the economy. ", " The Consumer Price Index increased by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter 2001 and by 6.0 per cent over the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 59</span>, <span class=\"no-wrap\">Table 11)</span>. The rise in the quarter was broadly based, although it was boosted by some factors which are likely to prove temporary. The recent tax changes continue to affect CPI inflation and the various measures of underlying inflation in year-ended terms. Despite falling in the March quarter, the rise in petrol prices over the past year is still boosting the year-ended CPI inflation rate. Making an allowance for these effects, underlying inflation is estimated to be about 2½ per cent, a little higher than it was estimated to be in December. This is consistent with some pass-through of the upstream price increases over the past year to the retail level. This assessment continues to be subject to a significant degree of uncertainty, reflecting the difficulty in estimating the size and timing of the tax effects. ", " As noted in the February <em>Statement</em>, the lower than expected outcomes for the CPI in the September and December quarters were open to three possible interpretations. One was that the timing of the net effects of the introduction of the GST and the abolition of Wholesale Sales Tax was different from what had been expected, with a smaller initial upward price impact followed by lesser downward price effects in subsequent quarters, perhaps because the falls in WST had been passed on more quickly than assumed. Alternatively, it was possible that the long-run price level increase associated with tax reform had simply been overestimated. The final possible explanation was that the net tax effects were broadly as expected, but that the underlying rate of inflation net of taxes had unexpectedly fallen – though whether this was temporary or persistent was unclear. Of course, these explanations are not mutually exclusive: it was possible that they were all true to some extent. With the benefit of the March quarter reading, it appears that businesses were initially slow to pass on some of the tax effects and various other cost pressures which were experienced during 2000, temporarily accepting a reduction in profit margins. This resulted in the lower-than-expected September and December quarter readings for CPI and underlying inflation. In the most recent quarter, it appears that more of these cost pressures have begun to be passed on, with the result that some of the price rises which were expected to occur last year have now shown up. ", " The largest contribution to the rise in the CPI in the March quarter was a 3.1 per cent increase in food prices. This largely reflected the effects of flooding in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, which caused severe shortages of fruit and vegetables that should prove temporary. The price of meat products also rose sharply in line with the increase in world prices following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in a number of countries. Other major contributors to the increase in the CPI in the March quarter were higher alcohol and tobacco prices, which were underpinned by the increase in excise on these items in February and an unwinding of discounting in the December quarter, as well as seasonal increases in the prices of education, childcare and pharmaceuticals (reflecting the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme). Partly offsetting these increases were falls in the prices of clothing, a result of the difficult trading environment in this sector, and domestic holiday travel and accommodation, reflecting discounted airfares. ", " The fall in petrol prices and the slower growth in the cost of house purchase also moderated the rise in the CPI in the March quarter. Petrol prices fell by 3.7 per cent in the March quarter – the first fall recorded in two years – although they remained over 11 per cent higher than a year earlier. Petrol prices rebounded during the March quarter, and if oil prices and the exchange rate remain around current levels, are likely to boost the CPI in the June quarter. The house purchase component of the CPI rose by 14 per cent over the year to the September quarter 2000 (including tax effects) but increased by just <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span> in each of the following two quarters, reflecting the subdued state of the housing sector. The additional $7,000 grant to first-home builders introduced in March lessened the increase in this component in the March quarter CPI and will have a similar effect in the June quarter. ", " Throughout 2000, the effect of the falling exchange rate appeared to be absorbed into retailers' margins, with subdued tradeables prices recorded in the CPI despite strong increases in import prices ‘at the docks’. This probably reflected some combination of competitive pressures, businesses' concerns about weakening domestic demand and a desire to avoid changing retail prices in response to falls in the exchange rate that many firms expected to be short-lived. In the March quarter, businesses appeared to pass some of the higher import prices through to the consumer. In aggregate, the prices of tradeable goods and services, excluding petrol, rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the quarter, although a significant part of the rise reflected higher prices for a range of food items. The price of imported motor vehicles rose by 2.7 per cent in the March quarter, the largest rise in this component in three years. The prices of other items with a high import content, such as appliances, toys and audio, visual and computing equipment, also rose. While the magnitude of many of these price rises was relatively small, the prices of these goods have been flat or on a downward trend in recent years. For example, the price of audio, visual and computing equipment has fallen by over 35 per cent over the past five years but rose by around 0.6 per cent over the past two quarters. ", " Upstream price pressures, which had been building over the course of 2000, abated in the March quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 12)</span>. Producer prices generally fell in the quarter, a result of lower world oil prices (with Asian-benchmarked oil prices falling by almost 14 per cent in the quarter), a slight rise in the exchange rate and softer world prices for some products. The effect of the fall in oil prices, and a more substantial decline in the price of diesel, is evident at all stages of production <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 60)</span>. Larger declines were recorded in prices at earlier stages of production in the March quarter, as the impact of commodity price movements on final-stage prices is diluted by the contribution of labour costs, overheads and profit margins. Excluding the movements in fuel prices, producer prices fell only modestly at earlier stages of production and, apart from import prices, recorded increases at the final stage. ", " The final-stage index of consumer products has increased by 4.0 per cent over the year. While this index most closely parallels the composition of the CPI, it places a much higher weight on goods and is measured at basic prices rather than retail prices (that is, prior to the imposition of indirect taxes, transport costs and trade margins). ", " Sharp rises in the prices of raw materials over the past year have driven rapid price rises at early stages of production. These movements were partly reversed in the March quarter. Within the manufacturing sector, the prices of inputs fell by 2.7 per cent in the quarter, largely due to lower oil prices and falling prices for base metals, both of which had risen strongly over the previous year. In the services sector, higher prices for road transport, together with higher real estate agents' fees, were partly offset by seasonal declines in the prices of business services related to television advertising. In the construction sector, the prices of building materials used in housing declined further in the March quarter, reflecting the downturn in residential construction, but increased at a modest pace for non-residential construction materials. ", " Overall, while upward pressure on domestic prices from prior increases in raw materials prices remains, there are indications that these pressures may have eased. This is supported by the major business surveys, which report that while product prices have increased quite strongly over the past year, they are likely to increase more slowly in the period ahead (Graph 61). The ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers indicates sharply lower expectations for product price rises in the June quarter and reduced inflationary pressures from input costs. The economy-wide NAB survey suggests that the rate at which firms expect to increase product prices has declined, as have expectations for input price inflation; firms expect that both will increase by around ½ a per cent in the June quarter. ", " Most measures of wages growth increased a little during the second half of 2000 (Table 13, Graph 62). The wage cost index (WCI) rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 per cent</span> over the year to December 2000, up from a little under <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> in mid 2000, with both the private-and public-sector components recording an increase. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) increased by 5.1 per cent over the course of 2000, up from <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.3 per cent</span> over the year to mid 2000. However, compositional effects, which seem likely to have overstated the underlying pace of wages growth in the recent period, continue to cloud the interpretation of the AWOTE data. The Mercer Cullen Egan Dell (MCED) <em>Salary Review</em> reported that executive base salaries increased by a little under 5 per cent over the year to the March quarter 2001, up from around 4½ per cent over the year to June 2000. In contrast to most of the other measures, however, a measure of non-executive pay that can be derived from the MCED data indicates that wages growth has been relatively steady, at just over 4 per cent over the year to March 2001. ", " Wage increases provided by new federal enterprise agreements picked up to an average annualised rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.9 per cent</span> in the December quarter 2000, from 3.4 per cent six months earlier. The wage increase for <span class=\"no-wrap\">private-sector</span> agreements rose to 4.1 per cent, up slightly from the observation for the September quarter, partly reflecting the effect of ‘Campaign 2000’ in the Victorian manufacturing sector; wage increases in the metals manufacturing sector increased by half a percentage point in the December quarter, to 4.6 per cent. In the construction industry, federal enterprise agreements certified in the December quarter provided an average wage increase of 4.9 per cent, in line with the agreements reached earlier in 2000. The average wage increase in public-sector agreements rose more sharply in the second half of 2000, but this was affected by distortions arising from renegotiation lags in a couple of large agreements, and the level of wage increases is moderate. Wage increases provided by the stock of all currently active federal agreements edged up slightly from 3.6 per cent in the middle of 2000 to 3.7 per cent in the December quarter. ", " Lower-than-expected CPI outcomes following the implementation of the tax changes in mid 2000 have reduced the likelihood of additional wage increases being generated by the GST-related clauses incorporated in some enterprise agreements, despite the prevalence of these clauses having risen over the course of 2000. Business surveys also point to reduced pressure on wages in the near term. The NAB survey indicates that there has been a further reduction in the number of firms reporting the lack of availability of suitable labour as a constraint on output. The latest ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers continues to suggest that labour constraints are relatively modest compared with the levels of late 1999 and early 2000, despite picking up slightly in the March quarter 2001. ", " In its Safety Net Review decision, announced on 2 May, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission granted a three-tier increase to award wages ranging from $13 to $17 per week depending on the award rate. This represents a similar increase, on average, to that which was granted last year. The federal minimum wage was increased by 3.2 per cent to $413.40 per week. ", " The inflation expectations of consumers have declined considerably following the introduction of the tax changes in mid 2000, and are now around the levels prevailing in 1998 (Graph 63). According to the Melbourne Institute, the median expectation for inflation over the coming year has fallen from a peak of over 8 per cent in May 2000 to be around 4 per cent over the past few months. Recent volatility in this series largely reflects the distribution of responses – a small increase in the number of respondents expecting higher rates of inflation can easily move the median from 3½ to 4½ per cent. ", " Financial-market economists surveyed by the Bank revised up their inflation forecasts for the year to June 2001 following the higher-than-expected March quarter CPI outcome, but inflation forecasts for the year to June 2002 edged down slightly (Table 14). The median inflation forecast for the year to June 2001 is 5.7 per cent and <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.7 per cent</span> excluding tax effects, while the median forecast for the year to June 2002 is 1.9 per cent and <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> excluding tax effects. The median estimate of the tax effects on inflation over the year to June 2001 has been revised up slightly to 3 per cent, and most respondents continue to expect tax changes to have little effect on inflation over the following year. Most respondents expect a moderate appreciation in the exchange rate and falls in oil prices over the forecast horizon. Trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), have increased their forecasts for inflation for 2001 and 2002, after decreasing them in the previous survey. In the most recent survey, union officials have returned to their view that inflation will remain high in 2002, despite the tax effects dropping out of the annual inflation figure. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of financial market participants, measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, have risen slightly over the past three months. A rise in nominal yields, in line with developments in global bond markets, implies that long-term inflation expectations are currently around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span>, about a quarter of a percentage point above implied expectations in February, but down from around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3¾                                          per cent</span> in early 2000. ", " Medium-term inflation expectations of businesses have fallen in the March quarter, largely reversing their rise over the past year. The March quarter NAB survey reports that the proportion of respondents expecting inflation to average more than 4 per cent has fallen to less than 10 per cent, while just over one-third expect inflation to average less than 3 per cent. These proportions are similar to expectations prevailing 12 to 18 months ago. ", " The latest CPI increase was above most expectations, in contrast to the two preceding observations, which were lower than expected. Abstracting from estimated tax effects, the various underlying measures of inflation in the March quarter give a range of readings which centre on 2½ per cent, up from the estimate of ‘around 2 per cent’ in December which the Bank offered in the February <em>Statement</em>. ", " The uncertainties in disentangling tax effects from underlying price movements since mid 2000 were outlined above. With the benefit of an additional CPI reading, it appears that the most plausible explanation is that businesses may have initially absorbed some of the effects of tax changes, exchange rate depreciation and other cost imposts in their margins, thus holding price increases below what would have been expected. Subsequently, it appears that businesses may have begun to rebuild margins, passing on some of the cost increases. Abstracting from this temporary margin squeeze, on balance, it appears that underlying inflation has changed little since the middle of 2000, after having increased noticeably over the preceding year. ", " This process of margin rebuilding probably has some way to go, given how far the exchange rate has fallen and the extent of various ‘upstream’ price pressures during 2000. Hence, it seems unlikely that inflation will fall noticeably in the short term. But equally, inflation is unlikely to increase in a way that would seriously threaten the inflation target, as the current period of weak growth in aggregate demand should help limit the degree to which businesses will be able to raise prices. ", " In addition, the pace of increase in producer prices has diminished. If this continues, the pressure on consumer prices from ‘upstream’ cost increases will, in time, also abate. Labour costs have picked up more quickly in the past couple of quarters, and this trend might well continue for a time. But wages growth remains moderate at present, and labour market conditions have softened in the past six months which should cap any tendency for acceleration in wages in due course. It is also helpful that inflation expectations of consumers have remained relatively steady in recent months and so are unlikely to fuel any increase in wage demands in the period ahead, and that there is little evidence of any wage rises initiated by the GST <em lang=\"la\">per se</em>. ", " Hence the Bank's forecast is that underlying inflation, net of taxes, will remain around its current rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> over the coming year. Measured by the Consumer Price Index – which is the inflation measure relevant for the inflation target over the medium term – inflation on a year-ended basis will remain high until the June quarter 2001 as a result of the effects of tax reforms. It could thereafter fall slightly below underlying measures of inflation as some additional indirect taxes are removed. Over a somewhat longer horizon, as the rate of increase in costs diminishes as a result of the current period of weak demand growth, inflation on both measures might fall slightly. This forecast is based on the standard technical assumption that the exchange rate remains around recent levels and that the price of oil remains around US$27 per barrel. ", " General risks to the inflation outlook can be seen in both directions. The upstream pressures associated with the lower exchange rate might flow through faster than currently envisaged and boost inflation in the year ahead. This would be more likely if the economy returns to strong growth relatively quickly, though in that case the exchange rate might well appreciate. The main downside risk is that the global (and therefore domestic) outlook for economic activity could weaken further. If it occurred, this would be expected to exert some disinflationary pressure into 2002. ", " There are over one million small businesses in Australia, accounting for 95 per cent by number of all businesses and around 30 per cent of private sector output.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> These businesses cover a wide range of activities, from tradespeople, to professionals, to small manufacturing or retailing concerns. Over half of small businesses consist only of the owner (or owners in the case of a partnership), with no employees. The average number of employees across all small businesses in 1999/2000 was around three. Consequently, small businesses employed around 40 per cent of the total workforce, or around 50 per cent of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">private-sector</span> workforce. In recent years, the number of people working in small businesses has grown broadly in line with that of the economy as a whole. ", " Small businesses are found in all the industry sectors of the economy, though they are more prevalent in some areas than others. The largest numbers of small businesses are in the property and business services, construction and retail sectors (Table A1). These industries account for around one-half of total employment in small businesses. In the construction sector, over three-quarters of the workforce are employed by small businesses, reflecting the importance of independent contractors in this industry. Small businesses account for a similarly large share of employment in agriculture. In contrast, small businesses employ less than <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> of the workforce in the mining and finance and insurance sectors. ", " While small businesses account for around 50 per cent of total private sector employment, they account for only around 30 per cent of sales and output. In part this reflects the concentration of small businesses in labour-intensive industries such as construction and retail trade. For the same reason, the investment rate of small businesses (measured by capital expenditure as a share of industry value added), at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent in 1998/99</span>, was lower than for large businesses which was around 27 per cent. The average hours worked in the small business sector tends to be higher than in the rest of the economy. In 1998/99, over one-quarter of small business operators worked at least 51 hours a week, compared with less than <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> for the workforce as a whole. ", " The rate of turnover of small businesses tends to be higher than for the rest of the economy. According to the Productivity Commission, in 1995/96 almost 8 per cent of small businesses ceased operations compared with around 5 per cent for medium and large businesses. The rate of small business formation is also much higher than for large firms. This implies that each year a disproportionately large share of new jobs tends to be created by small businesses. For example, in 1997/98, half of all the new jobs created in the economy were in small businesses, spread equally between new businesses starting operations and existing businesses expanding their operations. However, at the same time, half of all the jobs lost in the economy were also in small businesses, with the majority of these in businesses that ceased operations during the year. ", " The commercial structure of small businesses differs quite markedly from larger businesses. In 1998/99 around 43 per cent of small businesses with employees were incorporated, compared with 70 per cent for larger businesses; 17 per cent of small businesses were sole proprietorships and 38 per cent were partnerships and trusts. In the first half of 2000, there was a noticeable increase in the rate of incorporation, some of which may have been related to the introduction of the new tax system. Subsequently, the number of incorporations has slowed significantly to be around two-thirds of the rate in the first <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of 2000</span>. ", " ABS data suggest that, measured in simple terms, the rate of profitability is higher in small firms than larger firms. But this comparison is potentially misleading, since the income of the manager, who is often also the owner, might be taken as profits in the case of small firms but as a wage or salary in the case of larger firms. Hence no strong conclusion can be drawn from this comparison. Small firms tend to be more reliant than larger firms on borrowing from financial institutions as a source of funding. They generally do not have easy access to raise money from capital markets directly either in the form of equity raisings or by issuing corporate bonds, but rather depend on intermediated finance.

Forecasts for global growth have been revised upwards, and the large downside risks that were prevalent earlier in the year have generally dissipated. It now appears that most economies passed their weakest point late last year or early this year, although the recovery in 2002 embodied in current forecasts is generally relatively modest. ", " The turnaround has been most marked in the United States, where the economy grew strongly in the March quarter following modest growth in the December quarter, confirming that the slowdown in 2001 was quite mild and short-lived. This does not, of course, mean that the imbalances affecting the US economy have been fully resolved. The corporate sector in particular is still facing difficulties, and there are also doubts as to whether household spending growth can continue at its recent pace. Hence there remain risks to growth, and a somewhat slower pace can be expected in the remainder of the year. Even so, the recovery to date has exceeded earlier expectations. Monetary and fiscal policy settings are assisting growth and confidence has improved. ", " Conditions are also looking more promising in other parts of the world. The recovery in the US and improved conditions in the technology sector have contributed to a rebound in most east Asian economies in the early part of this year. In addition, domestic demand in these countries has been bolstered by the policy stimulus put in place last year. Cyclical conditions in Europe appear to be lagging those in the US, but there are signs that growth has resumed in recent months. There have also been signs of stabilisation in Japan. Although considerable downside risks remain, there has been an encouraging pick-up in the export-oriented sector of the Japanese economy, with manufacturing production increasing in the March quarter for the first time in over a year. ", " In contrast to most other economies, the Australian economy continued to grow strongly, despite the contractionary effect of the global slowdown. GDP grew by slightly more than 4 per cent over 2001, and appears to have sustained a similar pace of growth to date in 2002. In part, this relative strength has reflected the absence of a number of imbalances that have been retarding growth in other countries, particularly the US (for a comparison of the US and Australian economies, see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). ", " The latest indications are that household spending is still expanding at a robust pace, and conditions appear supportive of a continuation of this trend. Consumer confidence is high, and the strong growth in employment over the first part of this year should help sustain further growth in household spending in the period ahead, although this may to some extent be offset by rising petrol prices. While some of the recent strength in the labour market may have reflected postponement of hiring by businesses late last year when growth prospects were less promising, there does seem to have been a marked turnaround in labour market conditions since the beginning of the year. Forward indicators of labour demand remain favourable, with surveys of business hiring intentions at high levels and measures of job vacancies stronger in recent months. ", " Household spending has also been supported by increases in wealth, primarily resulting from rising house prices. House price rises of around 15 to 20 per cent have been recorded in a number of cities over the past year and, while increases of this magnitude are not exceptional for a single year, strong price rises have been ongoing for several years. Hence the cumulative increases over the past five years have been substantial, and are similar in real terms to those that occurred over the second half of the 1980s. Associated with the general rise in house prices in recent years has been a rapid expansion in household borrowing, which grew by 16½ per cent over the past year. A continuation of this trend clearly carries the risk of households, at some point, becoming overstretched. ", " The strength of house prices at present appears to be decoupled from trends in house-building activity. There are signs of over-supply in some areas of the market, and forward indicators of the housing sector have for some time been indicating that activity will slow in the second half of the year. At the same time, other parts of the economy are likely to strengthen, so that the composition of growth can be expected to change during the course of the year. Exports are likely to strengthen in line with an improving international outlook, and a rebound in business investment is also in prospect. ", " Businesses have become significantly more optimistic since the beginning of the year and balance sheets are in a healthy position, given the solid growth in profits that has occurred over the past year. Combined with the low cost of financing, these factors have contributed to a significant upgrade in investment intentions. In addition, there are a number of large infrastructure projects already underway or soon to commence which should also contribute to robust growth in output in the period ahead. ", " With global economic prospects improving in recent months, financial markets in many countries have begun to price in monetary tightening in the year ahead, in expectation that central banks will look to restore interest rates to more normal levels after the substantial easings that took place last year. A number of central banks have already begun to raise official interest rates. ", " This swing in interest rate expectations was also evident in Australia. In fact, with the Australian economy surprising most observers with its resilience, and maintaining a growth rate substantially faster than that of other developed economies, expectations of monetary tightening built quite quickly. As late as February, markets were pricing in the likelihood of a prolonged period of steady interest rates, but by early May they were expecting increases in official rates of about one percentage point over the course of this year. The Bank's decision to raise official rates by ¼ percentage point, to 4.5 per cent, in its May Board meeting had therefore been largely anticipated by markets. ", " The relative strength of the Australian economy has also been reflected in other ways in financial markets. Share prices in Australia, despite recent falls, remain more robust than in other countries, as company profits here have held up better than elsewhere. Also, there has been a significant increase in demand for Australian dollars, resulting in a rise in the exchange rate of about 5 per cent against the US dollar and a little less in trade-weighted terms. ", " The inflation outcome in the March quarter was broadly in line with the outlook presented in previous <em>Statements</em>, and showed that inflation remained close to the top of the target range. The increase in the CPI in the quarter was boosted by a number of seasonal influences, including the price of Pharmaceuticals and education, as well as a further large rise in the cost of overseas travel, while petrol prices again fell slightly in the quarter and, over the past year, have reduced the rise in the CPI. Over the year these influences have roughly offset one another, so that underlying inflation is probably about the same as CPI inflation. ", " The recent rise in international oil prices, if sustained, should boost the CPI over the next few quarters both through the direct impact on households and possibly indirectly through increased pressure on business margins. At the same time, upstream cost data suggest that other sources of pressure on business margins may have eased for the time being (except for rising insurance premiums and utility prices). ", " In the past few years the broader trend in inflation has been upward, with the inflation rate (excluding tax effects) gradually rising from under 2 per cent in 1998 to around 3 per cent in the most recent couple of quarters. This trend has in part reflected the substantial depreciation of the Australian dollar that took place over the 1997–2000 period. These exchange-rate effects have been expected to fade gradually, and, with domestic cost pressures well contained, recent <em>Statements</em> have presented a relatively benign inflation outlook, stating that inflation would decline to around the middle of the target band over the course of 2002. The Bank's assessment is that this outcome is still likely over the coming year, particularly given the recent tendency of the Australian dollar to appreciate, which should help further dampen inflation pressures in the tradable sector. However, the significant strengthening in the domestic economy that has become evident in recent months suggests that the longer-term risks to the inflation outlook have increased, with upward pressures on inflation likely to predominate beyond the end of this year. Over the course of 2003, inflation is expected to rise back toward the top of the target band, as a continuation of rapid growth in demand and activity would see capacity constraints start to put upward pressure on wages and prices. ", " During 2001 the Bank reduced interest rates to historically low levels, reflecting principally a deteriorating international outlook and the potential risks that this posed to the Australian economy, while at the same time Australia was judged to have a relatively benign inflation outlook. In recent months the economic climate has clearly changed, with the Australian economy proving very resilient to these forces and global prospects improving. Against this background the Board concluded at its May meeting that the previous setting of monetary policy was no longer appropriate. Maintaining the cash rate at such a low level risked amplifying inflationary risks and fuelling other imbalances that could jeopardise a continuation of the current economic expansion. The decision to raise the cash rate by 25 basis points was aimed at reducing these risks, and thereby enhancing the prospects for sustained growth with low inflation. ", " Global economic conditions have improved in recent months, driven mainly by a pick-up in the US and several Asian countries. In the US it seems clear that the trough in activity was in the September quarter 2001 and a recovery is now underway. In particular, demand in the information technology and communications (ITC) sector, which was the major source of weakness in the 2001 slowdown, is picking up. This has benefited a number of countries in the Asian region, but domestic demand is also recovering in these economies reflecting the policy stimulus put in place last year. The slowdown in Europe has lagged that of the US, yet there are some indications of improvement. In contrast, conditions in Japan remain weak, though there are some tentative signs of stabilisation. ", " The IMF and Consensus forecasts released in April suggest a recovery in world growth to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span> in 2002 and a further pick-up to around 4 per cent next year (Table 1). If this were to eventuate, the trough in growth in 2001 will have been shallower than that recorded in the global recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s. However, the rebound expected over the course of 2002 is expected to be modest, with growth in G7 countries not returning to around its long-run average until the end of 2003 (Graph 1). This reflects the fact that in contrast to earlier slowdowns, household consumption and activity in the housing market in the industrialised countries has remained resilient, buoyed by stimulatory macroeconomic policies, strong growth in incomes and the decline in oil prices through 2001. Accordingly, households may be somewhat overstretched and the boost in household spending that is normally associated with the recovery phase of the cycle is likely to be more muted this time. ", " There are risks on both sides of this outlook. On the downside, any further decline in asset markets, particularly in the US, could result in a retrenchment of business investment and household spending. A further deterioration in the outlook for Japan would also pose a risk to the recoveries in the rest of Asia. The political tensions in the Middle East could have a significant impact on the global recovery were oil prices to rise substantially from current levels (see ‘<a href=\"#opd\">Oil Price Developments</a>’ below). On the other hand, notwithstanding the recent upward adjustments to some official interest rates, macroeconomic policy settings could remain very accommodative and, as a result, the recovery might be stronger than is currently forecast. ", " Output in the US grew strongly in the March quarter, with GDP increasing by 1.4 per cent, to be 1.6 per cent higher over the year, implying that the downturn in 2001 was relatively mild and short-lived (Graph 2). Household consumption continued to contribute to growth and public demand again grew strongly, particularly <span class=\"no-wrap\">defence-related</span> spending (Table 2). Economic conditions in the business sector were mixed. Inventories made a large contribution to growth in the March quarter. However, business investment continued to fall – particularly investment in buildings and transport equipment – though business spending on ITC equipment rose for the first time in over a year. ", " The ongoing strength of the household sector into the new year reflected the boost to household incomes from the additional income tax cuts from 1 January and the withdrawal of home equity through mortgage refinancing late last year. However, the pace of consumption growth has slowed from the very strong rate of late last year, in part reflecting the recent pick-up in oil prices which is likely to have dampened households' non-oil consumption. Consumer sentiment has also levelled out. ", " The unemployment rate rose to 6 per cent in April (Graph 3). The manufacturing sector has continued to shed jobs, though the pace of losses has slowed considerably and the employment component of the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) index is around its highest level since late 2000. Employment has increased modestly in the services and government sectors. ", " Manufacturing production increased for the first time in over a year in the March quarter, with ITC production rising by 4 per cent. Manufacturers' overall sentiment according to the ISM index has improved markedly in recent months to be significantly above 50, a level associated with increasing production. ", " Consumer price inflation, after reaching a low of 1.1 per cent earlier in the year reflecting the decline in energy prices over the course of 2001, increased slightly to 1.4 per cent over the year to March. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, has eased slightly to be around 2½ per cent over the past year, though this reflects divergent trends in goods and services prices (Graph 4). Growth in the national accounts measure of core inflation has also slowed over the past year. Wage outcomes have begun to drift lower, with growth in the wages and salaries component of the employment cost index continuing to ease. ", " Reflecting its assessment that the outlook for prices remains benign, the US Federal Reserve has maintained its accommodative monetary policy stance, leaving official interest rates at 1¾ per cent since last December. Nevertheless, the Fed moved its balance of risks from being on the ‘downside’ to ‘neutral’ at its March meeting. Fiscal policy remains stimulative with further assistance provided in the March quarter, by means of income tax cuts and increased defence and terrorist-related spending. An additional US$50 billion stimulus package (equivalent to <span class=\"no-wrap\">½                                        a per cent</span> of GDP) was also enacted in March, which included an extension of unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, the provision of tax incentives for business and further assistance to the recovery effort in New York City. ", " Growth in the Canadian economy has gained momentum, with industrial production in the three months to February rising by close to 1 per cent. The recovery in the US has helped, with Canadian motor vehicle manufacturers, in particular, benefiting from the strength in US motor vehicle sales. Low official interest rates have also contributed to strong growth in household spending. Citing stronger-than-expected economic growth in Canada and the US, the Bank of Canada raised official interest rates for the first time in this cycle – by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> to 2¼ per cent – in April. The Bank lowered official interest rates by 375 basis points in 2001. ", " The Japanese economy contracted further towards the end of last year, with output in the December quarter almost 2 per cent lower than in the same period a year earlier. Nevertheless there are some tentative indications that conditions have stabilised in the new year. The Tankan survey suggests that business sentiment has steadied, with manufacturers' sentiment unchanged in the March quarter and the rate of decline in other sectors slowing. Foreign machinery orders have picked up over the past couple of months, albeit from very low levels, and some indicators of activity in the ITC sector have improved, reflecting the pick-up in global demand (Graph 5). The depreciation of the Japanese yen late last year should also provide some support for the export-oriented sectors. This demand, to date, has been met by a rundown in inventories. Business investment is expected to remain weak for quite some time, consistent with low rates of capacity utilisation. ", " In line with developments in the business sector over the past year, the labour market continued to deteriorate. Employment fell by around 1½ per cent in the year to the March quarter, its sharpest fall in year-ended <span class=\"no-wrap\">terms in 25 years</span>. The unemployment rate was 5.2 per cent in March, only slightly below the peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.5 per cent</span> reached in December (Graph 6). With wages also falling, household incomes have contracted. Consumer prices continue to fall, with CPI deflation 1.2 per cent over the year to March. ", " Economic prospects for the rest of Asia have improved, consistent with firming global demand for ITC products, the turnaround in the US and stimulative macroeconomic policies. A return to growth in exports across much of Asia boosted GDP for the region as a whole in the December quarter with the rise in export volumes particularly pronounced in Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Strength in domestic demand accounted for much of the growth in China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines. The strength in domestic demand mainly reflected increases in consumption; private investment continued to decline across the region reflecting the build-up of spare capacity over the past year or so. ", " The pick-up in manufacturing output, which was evident towards the end of last year, has continued into 2002. Industrial production in aggregate rose by around 3 per cent in the three months to February, though for Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines it remains well below the peaks recorded in the second half of 2000 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 7)</span>. Much of the recent pick-up was driven by the recovery in the ITC sector, with ITC production in the four major ITC-producing countries back around early 2001 levels. Korea has fared much better than the other ITC producers partly because its exports as a share of GDP, and ITC exports as a share of total exports, are smaller than for the other major ITC producing countries. ", " The divergences in industrial production are also evident in labour markets across the region. Unemployment rates have continued to increase in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan this year to be somewhat higher than those reached during the Asian financial crisis. In contrast, the unemployment rate in Korea reached its lowest level in four years earlier this year (Table 3). ", " Consumer price inflation in most countries across the region has risen slightly in the early part of this year, after declining for much of 2001. The latest increase is due partly to the rise in oil prices and to seasonal volatility associated with demand around the Chinese New Year. Hong Kong and China, with exchange rates pegged to the US dollar, have experienced significant price falls over the past year, though Singapore has also recorded a price fall. ", " Domestic demand in New Zealand has been growing strongly in recent quarters, and both consumer and business confidence have returned to pre-September levels. CPI inflation was 2.6 per cent over the year to the March quarter, with increased housing costs and food prices accounting for most of the rise in the index. With inflation now towards the top end of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's target range the RBNZ has increased the official cash rate in two steps by a total of 50 basis points to 5¼ per cent. ", " There is some evidence that business conditions have improved in the euro area after output in the December quarter declined for the first time since March 1993. In Germany, where the slowdown was most pronounced, business sentiment has recovered in the early months of 2002, with the Ifo survey measure of business confidence now rising back towards its long-run average (Graph 8). This should eventually translate into increased capital spending, as investment as a share of GDP in Germany is currently at its lowest level since re-unification. Industrial production has also risen in the other major countries, most notably in France and Spain. ", " Consumption in the euro area weakened over the course of 2001, though not by as much as recorded during previous slowdowns. Employment growth has slowed in the major euro area economies over the past year and a half, with particular weakness evident in Germany. However, with some of the smaller economies still creating jobs, and participation rates falling, the unemployment rate for the euro area in aggregate has remained near 10-year lows for much of the period. Consumer sentiment has also improved. ", " Euro area inflation has edged higher over the past few years with both the CPI and core measures of inflation currently around 2¼ – 2½ per cent (Graph 9). The volatility in euro area CPI inflation over the past year or so mainly reflects the impact of large movements in food and energy prices. ", " Output in the UK was little changed over the December and March quarters. Manufacturing production appears to have stabilised in recent months, though it remains nearly 6 per cent lower than a year ago. The services sector remains supportive of growth, in line with continuing increases in household spending. The latter has been boosted by low interest rates and rising house prices, as well as an historically low unemployment rate. Year-ended inflation (excluding mortgage payments) has been steady at around 2¼ per cent over the past couple of months, with increased fuel prices offsetting the impact of lower food prices. ", " Oil prices have risen sharply over the past few months, returning them to the middle of OPEC's target band <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 10)</span>. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaged US$26 per barrel during April, which is <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 per cent</span> higher than the low point reached in November 2001, but around the levels prevailing during <span class=\"no-wrap\">most of 2001</span>. The rise was prompted by reports of improved prospects for world growth, particularly following the release of fourth-quarter GDP figures for the US. OPEC's announcement in March that it would maintain supply cuts until mid 2002, combined with limited production cuts from Russia, lent further support to prices, as did heightened tensions in the Middle East, including the threat of US military action against Iraq. The increase in oil prices has begun to show up in inflation in the major industrial countries, removing some of the disinflationary impulse from declining oil prices in the latter months of 2001. ", " The cycle of global monetary easing that began in early 2001 had largely ended by the end of that year, as global economic prospects had begun to improve. The focus of financial markets has since switched to the issue of how quickly central banks would ‘normalise’ rates. The first moves were in March, when the Reserve Bank of <span class=\"no-wrap\">New Zealand</span> and Sweden's Riksbank each increased policy rates by 25 basis points. Both these central banks tightened further in April, and were joined by the Bank of Canada, which also increased its policy rate by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> (Table 4, Graph 11). As interest rates in most economies are near historical lows, market expectations are that there will be a series of increases over the coming year. ", " At its March meeting, the US Federal Reserve removed the easing bias that had been in place for the previous <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 months</span>. Financial markets initially interpreted this (and a series of stronger-than-expected data releases) as an indication that the Federal Reserve was preparing the ground for an increase in official rates at its 7 May meeting. However, since then, softer data and comments from Federal Reserve officials have seen expectations of monetary tightening in the US pushed back to the second half of the year. ", " The Fed funds futures market is now reflecting expectations of a cumulative increase of around 75 basis points by end 2002 (Graph 12). Given the low starting point for the Fed funds rate – a 40-year low of 1.75 per cent – the implied level at end 2002 would remain substantially below the average level over the past 10 years. ", " The European Central Bank and the Bank of England have also signalled that the balance of risks has moved over recent months away from future economic weakness, leading to expectations of increases in official interest rates this year. ", " Japan remains the exception among the major economies, with market analysts continuing to call for further monetary easing to tackle deflation. With official interest rates having fallen to zero some time ago, the focus of policy has been the level of bank reserves at the Bank of Japan. These have risen sharply over the past year. Policy was last changed in February when the central bank increased its monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds by <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>200 billion to <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>1 trillion, and said that it would supply ample liquidity above the reserves target of <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>10–15 trillion to ensure stability ahead of the end-March close of the financial year. ", " Short-term interest rates in most emerging markets have been relatively stable over the past three months, although Argentina has been a noticeable exception in the wake of its January devaluation. Short-term interest rates in that country have risen to 110 per cent in April, from around 30 per cent a year earlier. ", " Long bond yields around the world have, on balance, increased over recent months. Yields on US government 10-year debt increased substantially in February and March on better-than-expected economic data, although part of this increase was reversed in April as economic data turned softer and expectations of increases in policy rates were scaled back (Graph 13). Recently, yields on 10-year bonds have been around 5.1 per cent, about the same as they were a year ago, but well up on their low of 4.2 per cent in November 2001. ", " In European bond markets, yields have followed a similar pattern to that seen in the US; they increased substantially in February and March but have since fallen back somewhat. ", " As has often been the case over the past few years, movements in yields on Japanese government bonds have followed an independent course reflecting the specific circumstances of the Japanese economy. They rose in January and February in the lead-up to the end-March close of the Japanese financial year, on concerns that the year end might precipitate problems in the financial sector. They subsequently fell back, however, as it became clear that the new financial year would begin without event. More recently, yields have risen again, following Standard and Poor's April downgrading of Japan from AA to AA−, with a further downgrade expected from Moody's. ", " Risk aversion has generally moderated in global markets over recent months. This has been most evident in the ongoing decline in yield spreads (relative to US government bond yields) on emerging market debt and in low-rated corporate debt (Graphs 14 and 15). Despite the continuing crisis in Argentina, spreads on sovereign debt in all the major regions have continued to narrow (although Latin American spreads increased a little in April). Emerging market spreads are generally at their lowest levels in around four years. ", " Equity markets in major countries have been fairly subdued over the past three or four months. In the US, the Wilshire Index (the broadest measure of US share prices, accounting for over 90 per cent of listed companies) is down by a net 6 per cent in 2002 while the NASDAQ is down by around 19 per cent (Graph 16, Table 5). Two factors seemed to be working to cause share prices to fall. The first was that earnings announcements by companies during the current quarterly reporting season have tended to disappoint market expectations, and in some cases were accompanied by warnings about the outlook. Earnings concerns were particularly noticeable in the tech sector. Second, there seemed to be a growing realisation that equity valuations are still very high by historical standards and, unless there is a strong recovery in profits soon, share prices would need to correct substantially to restore P/E ratios to anything approaching normal levels. The current P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500, at around 45, is unprecedented in over 130 years of history (Graph 17). The long-run average for this series is just under 15. ", " Share prices in most other major countries have also been subdued over recent months. Both the Euro STOXX index (a broad index of over 300 major Euro area companies) and the FTSE 100 are down in the year to date. In contrast, the Japanese Topix index has strengthened substantially over the past three months, after touching 17-year lows in early February. While some of this strength was attributed to the introduction of restrictions on short sales and rumoured government activity, the market has also benefited from some more positive economic indicators, particularly industrial production and exports. ", " In contrast to the performance of most developed country equity markets, emerging market equities have shown some modest gains over the past three months, boosted by improving economic conditions in most countries and signs of a strengthening world economy. Asian share prices are up an average 6 per cent since early February <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 18)</span>, while Latin American share prices are up around 2 per cent on average. ", " Signs that the US economy might be recovering more quickly than the rest of the world were reflected in <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> strength early in 2002, but the currency has since weakened. The dollar fell by around 4½ per cent in trade-weighted terms in the three months to early May (Graph 19). Analysts have cited various factors as contributing to this recent fall, including weakness in the US share market, indications that US interest rates will be increased more gradually than earlier thought, and the renewed deterioration in the US trade position. ", " The recent weakness of the US dollar has been fairly broad-based, with all major currencies strengthening against it since early February. The yen and euro each appreciated around 6 per cent against the dollar in this period <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 20)</span>. Indeed, apart from dollar weakness, there have been only small changes in cross rates among the major foreign currencies. ", " Most emerging market currencies have been relatively stable over the past three months. The most notable exception remains the Argentinean peso, which has weakened 68 per cent against the US dollar since the currency board was abandoned in early January, falling from parity to around 3.1 pesos per dollar. This fall is of the same order as that experienced by Russia and Indonesia after their crises, and is significantly larger than those in other countries which experienced financial crises. ", " The Australian dollar has gradually appreciated over the past three months, and traded near a 15-month high of around 54 US cents in early May (Graph 21). Although the 6 per cent appreciation seen this year against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> in part reflected a generalised weakening of the latter currency, the Australian dollar also appreciated by a modest amount against other major currencies (around 2 per cent against the yen and the euro). The trade-weighted index (TWI) has risen by about 3 per cent over the past three months and is currently near its highest level since January 2001. ", " A range of factors has helped the exchange rate to strengthen in recent months. On the international front, there has been an improvement in the global outlook, which has resulted in stronger commodity prices. The RBA index of commodity prices is at its highest level in SDR terms since October 1997. The strength of the Australian economy more broadly has also supported the exchange rate, as it has caused interest differentials to move in the dollar's favour and has underpinned a relatively strong equity market. Portfolio equity flows into Australia exceeded outflows by Australian funds managers over 2001, and market participants report substantial net purchases of equities by foreign investors over the first four months of the year, which may also have lent support to the Australian dollar. (See <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> for a more general discussion of equity flows and the exchange rate.) ", " Demand by Japanese investors for A$ bonds remains strong. Issues of Australian dollar Eurobonds directly to Japanese retail investors (A$ Uridashi) were close to A$3 billion in the first four months of the year (Graph 22). This is the highest rate of issue since the mid 1990s when interest rates also favoured Australian investments. ", " With conditions in the foreign exchange market orderly and the exchange rate strengthening in recent months, the Bank's purchases of foreign exchange and earnings on reserves have exceeded its sales to the Commonwealth Government. As a result, the Bank's transactions in foreign exchange have added to net reserves. At the end of April, net reserves stood at $7.7 billion, compared with $6.8 billion in January. In addition to these outright transactions, the Bank has slightly reduced its foreign exchange swap transactions as it has been better able to handle domestic liquidity flows by domestic market operations. Swaps outstanding are currently $27 billion compared with $30 billion in January. Gross holdings of reserves have fallen correspondingly. ", " Against the background of a global slowdown, the Australian economy recorded good growth during 2001. GDP rose by 1.3 per cent in the December quarter to be 4.1 per cent higher than a year earlier (Table 6, Graph 23). Over the course of the year, the composition of growth shifted markedly from external demand to domestic demand. In the December quarter, domestic demand increased by 2.1 per cent, driven by the recovery in business investment, higher public demand and strong growth in consumption. This more than compensated for the decline in exports that resulted from the downturn in the global economy. Output growth has also become more broad-based among the states. ", " The outlook for the Australian economy remains positive. The world economy is showing evidence of a modest recovery, which should help to support a pick-up in exports. A high level of consumer confidence and the improvement in the labour market should boost household incomes and underpin further strong growth in consumption through 2002. The main force expected to dampen growth in the second half of this year is a downturn in dwelling investment, as the strength in new building activity of recent quarters abates and moves more closely in line with underlying demand for housing. Against this, however, the sound position of corporate balance sheets, improved profitability and the low cost of business finance should sustain the incipient recovery in business investment over the next two years. ", " Household spending increased by just over 4 per cent over the course of 2001 and by 1.3 per cent in the December quarter. While part of the recent strength has been associated with the rebound in housing activity, most categories of expenditure have recorded solid growth. Recent indicators suggest ongoing strength in aggregate consumption in the first months of 2002. Real retail sales, which account for more than a third of household consumption, rose by 1.6 per cent in the March quarter, to be 5 per cent higher than a year <span class=\"no-wrap\">earlier (Graph 24)</span>. Households' purchases of motor vehicles moved strongly higher in the early months of 2002, rising by 11 per cent in the March quarter following relatively flat sales in 2001. ", " These generally favourable trends in consumption are consistent with the high level of consumer sentiment prevailing in recent months. According to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey, consumer sentiment has recovered strongly over the past six months to be well above its long-run average. Sentiment relating to personal finances over the past year, economic conditions over the coming year and attitudes towards buying a major household item have improved markedly in recent months. ", " While growth in household consumption has been strong, increases in real household disposable income – the main driver of consumption – have been relatively subdued, compared with recent years. Gross household income increased at an annual pace of 2.8 per cent in the second half of 2001. The deceleration in income growth mainly reflected subdued growth in employment and wages and a significant fall in dividend income, partly associated with the lowering of the corporate tax rate from 1 July, which encouraged payment of dividends in the first half of the year. ", " Three factors have enabled households to maintain solid consumption growth despite subdued nominal income growth. Firstly, household borrowing has been buoyant, with part of this borrowing being used directly for consumption. Second, higher asset values have added considerably to household wealth, and, when combined with an increase in the rate of housing equity withdrawal, have provided households with the scope to finance consumption. Finally, the decline in petrol prices in the second half of 2001 boosted real household incomes and thereby assisted households to spend. ", " More recently, and as detailed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-economic-developments\">International    Economic Developments</a>’, the stimulatory impulse from lower petrol prices has been reversed. Since January, crude oil prices have increased by 30 per cent. The significance of the impact of higher oil prices on consumption is difficult to quantify. One approach is to calculate the direct effect on household incomes. On this basis every 10 cent rise in the price of petrol at the pump reduces household purchasing power by around $300 per annum, equivalent to about ½ a per cent of average household disposable income. This figure, however, is likely to be an upper bound, since Australia is a net exporter of energy and consequently income for the economy as a whole (including, indirectly, some consumers) would be boosted as a result of higher oil prices. ", " Household borrowing increased at an annualised rate of 15½ per cent over the six months to March, driven by borrowing for housing. The higher levels of household borrowing in recent years have led to a sharp rise in household debt since the mid 1990s. The interest burden, however, has remained around 6 per cent of household disposable income (Graph 25). On the other side of the household balance sheet, growth in asset values over 2001 was particularly strong, underpinned by gains in dwelling prices, while growth in equity prices remained solid, although well down on previous years (Table 7). The ratios of household assets and consumption to income are at very high levels by historical standards. ", " The recovery in housing activity continued in the December quarter 2001, largely owing to low interest rates, strong demand among investors and government support for first-home buyers. Dwelling investment increased by 4.1 per cent in the December quarter, to be 21.5 per cent higher over the course of the year. Expenditure on alterations and additions fell slightly in the quarter, but remained 16 per cent higher over the year. ", " However, and as foreshadowed in the previous <em>Statement</em>, leading indicators of housing activity have now started to turn down and suggest that dwelling investment will peak around the middle of this year (Graph 26). Building approvals for houses have fallen by 13 per cent from the peak last August. These trends are mirrored in the value of loan approvals for new construction, which fell by around a quarter in February. The number of First Home Owner Grants paid also fell in March, largely reflecting the fall in Commonwealth Additional Grants for new dwellings that has occurred following the reduction in the additional grant from $7,000 to $3,000 on 1 January. ", " The expiration of the Commonwealth Additional Grant at the end of June will amplify the expected downturn in the housing cycle in the second half of 2002, since one consequence of the limited duration of the scheme has been to bring forward the decision of first-home buyers to purchase a new dwelling. The impact, however, is likely to be much more limited than that associated with the introduction of the GST, since the home ownership schemes only extend to first-home buyers. A potentially bigger downward force on future building activity is an oversupply of dwellings. The current extent of oversupply appears to be less than at the peak of previous housing cycles, but is evident in certain areas and especially for medium-density dwellings. ", " All published indices of house prices showed very strong increases in the December quarter, and the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Commonwealth    Bank/</span>Housing Industry Association (CBA/HIA) measure recorded a further large increase in the March quarter. The ABS measure, which allows for the effect of compositional change in the sample of houses sold, rose by 3.8 per cent in the December quarter to be 15.5 per cent higher than a year earlier and follows strong house price growth over the past couple of years. The Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) and CBA/HIA measures of house prices also show large increases over the past year. The current cycle of house price rises has brought about a cumulative increase in prices in real terms similar to the experience of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">late 1980s</span> (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). Moreover, unlike previous cycles in house prices, where there was considerable regional variation, all major capital cities have recorded strong house price increases. ", " The improvement in output growth over the course of 2001 was concentrated in the goods production and distribution sectors, supported by the upswing in residential construction and strong retail trade activity, with flow-on effects to manufacturing and wholesale trade. The business services sector was dampened by a sharp slowdown in the communication industry, but overall has maintained a relatively solid pace of growth. Growth in household services increased, driven largely by health services and despite weakness in tourism, where fewer overseas arrivals since last August and a decline in domestic air travel led to a fall in output in hospitality services. Prohibitive public liability premiums or difficulty obtaining coverage have also affected the tourism and recreation industries, where the value of premiums paid is high relative to revenue. ", " All major surveys of business conditions indicate that firms have shrugged off the pessimism linked to the global economic downturn during 2001, with current conditions consistent with robust growth in coming quarters. The NAB survey for the March quarter reported an improvement in trading conditions, profitability and employment and are at levels above their long-run average (Graph 27). Export sales, however, were reported to have deteriorated further in the quarter, suggesting that the slowdown in the global economy is still a drag on domestic growth. Business surveys covering the manufacturing sector, such as the ACCI-Westpac, AIG and the Dun &amp; Bradstreet surveys, with the latter covering the wholesale and retail trade industries as well, also reported improved business conditions in the March quarter. ", " Corporate profits, as measured by gross operating surplus (GOS), increased by around 6 per cent in the December quarter, to be about 11 per cent higher than a year earlier. The quarterly rise was broadly based, reflecting continued strength in domestic demand, some evidence of moderation in margin pressures and a further rise in resource sector profitability. Small business profits were close to unchanged in the quarter, but were 10 per cent higher over the year, in line with buoyant conditions in the retail and housing sectors. As a share of GDP, corporate profits before interest increased to 15 per cent in the December quarter, which is slightly above the average level over the past decade (Graph 28). ", " The rise in corporate profits combined with relatively stable total disbursements – such as interest payments, taxation and dividend payments – resulted in total internal funding increasing strongly in the second half of 2001, which has been reflected in higher business deposits with intermediaries, and a reduced demand for business credit. With a pick-up in investment expenditure and intentions, there are now some signs of increased business borrowing activity. Business credit grew by 1.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the six months to March, after declining by a comparable amount in the previous six months, and net business loan approvals have risen sharply in recent months. The comparatively healthy performance of the Australian equity market continues to provide listed companies with an additional source of funding, and equity raisings remained at a firm pace in the March quarter. As a result of these trends in debt and equity issuance, the aggregate debt-to-equity ratio for the private non-financial corporate sector dropped considerably in the December quarter, and the interest burden remained low by historical standards. ", " The improvement in sentiment, higher corporate profits and the generally favourable balance sheet position of corporations appear to be providing the foundation for a recovery in business investment. Capital outlays increased by nearly 6 per cent in the December quarter, to be 4.5 per cent higher over the year. As a result, business investment as a share of GDP rose in the December quarter, although it remains at a low level (Graph 29). Most of the rise was in machinery and equipment expenditure, consistent with strong growth in underlying capital imports in the second half of 2001. Expenditure on intangible fixed assets also rose strongly in the December quarter, underpinned by higher mineral and petroleum exploration and investment in computer software, though growth remains well below the average during the 1990s. In contrast, expenditure on buildings and structures declined in the December quarter, mainly reflecting a fall in engineering construction. ", " Looking forward, most business surveys and the ABS capital expenditure survey suggest a strong recovery in business investment next financial year. The first estimate of capital expenditure for 2002/03 implies that investment in machinery and equipment could grow by around 14 per cent in nominal terms, based on a five-year average realisation ratio, underpinned by mining and transport equipment investment. The communications industry, however, is likely to experience a reduction in capital expenditure in 2002/03, as subdued activity in this sector leads firms to scale back investment plans considerably. ", " The capital expenditure survey suggests an even more marked turnaround in investment expenditure on buildings and structures in 2002/03, following very steep falls at the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001. Approvals and work yet to be done have continued their upward trend since late last year, with commencements returning to relatively high levels in the second half of 2001. Much of the growth in 2002/03 is expected to come from the finance and property and business services sectors, underpinned by an increase in office construction. Engineering construction by the private sector is expected to pick up strongly, particularly in the mining sector, following a number of major projects commencing in recent quarters, such as the fourth-train expansion of the North-West Shelf LNG plant, several coal-related projects and an alumina refinery. The recent commencement of a number of large public infrastructure projects will also be a significant addition to total investment spending in coming years. The favourable outlook for investment is supported by the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em>, which has reported a sharp rise in the value of projects recently commenced and in the pipeline. ", " The labour market was slow to reflect the recovery in output growth during the second half of 2001. While output rose by 4.1 per cent through the year, employment increased by less than 1 per cent and the unemployment rate edged higher. Since the beginning of 2002, however, labour force data and indicators of labour demand have shown a major upturn. The recovery partly reflects delayed hiring activity from last year, but also the ongoing strength in domestic demand so far this year. In the March quarter, employment grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>, to be 1.8 per cent higher over the year, and by the month of March the unemployment rate had declined by ¾ of a percentage point from its recent peak of 7 per cent (Graph 30). Moreover, for the first time since mid 2000, full-time employment made a significant contribution to total employment growth, increasing by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter, to be around the level of a year ago. The strength in part-time employment growth evident throughout 2001 continued in 2002. The improvement in the labour market is evident in all the mainland states, especially Queensland (Table 8). ", " Other indicators of labour market utilisation have also improved. This is evident in a pick-up in average hours worked per week, albeit from historically low levels. Wider definitions of unemployment, which include part-timers wanting to work longer hours and persons not in the labour force but willing and available for work, also fell in the March quarter. ", " Employment in the business services sector increased in the March quarter, although it remains well down on the levels of a year ago, particularly in those industries most exposed to the downturn in the ITC sector (Table 9). Construction employment also rose in the March quarter, as the housing recovery continued. Employment increases are also evident in industries that had been most exposed to the slowdown in tourism, especially accommodation, cafes and restaurants. Employment in the transport and storage sector, however, fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.7 per cent</span> in the March quarter, and manufacturing sector employment was flat in the quarter and has fallen by 3.2 per cent over the year, compared with the longer-term decline in this sector of around ½ per cent per annum over the past two decades. ", " The pick-up in output growth over 2001, coupled with relatively weak employment growth, resulted in an increase in labour productivity, measured as output per person employed, of 1 per cent in the December quarter, to be 3.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. On an hours-worked basis, the rise in productivity is even more pronounced since average hours worked fell in the December quarter (Graph 31). This pick-up in productivity growth continues to reverse the cyclical decline seen in 2000. Looking through these temporary swings there is no sign that the trend in productivity growth since the mid 1990s has changed. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand have improved over the past couple of months (Graph 32). Measures of hiring intentions from the NAB, ACCI-Westpac, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and the AIG surveys have become increasingly positive and are at high levels. Looking through volatility in the series owing to the early timing of Easter, the ANZ newspaper-based measure has picked up significantly since the beginning of the year. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) skilled vacancies series has remained roughly flat over the past year. The ABS employer-based measure of vacancies rose by 3.6 per cent in the March quarter, having fallen throughout 2001. ", " After contracting sharply towards the end of last year, Australia's exports recovered in the March quarter in line with the recovery in the world economy, so that the balance of trade returned to a small surplus in the quarter. Assuming that the net income deficit remained constant as a share of GDP, the deficit on the current account is likely to have narrowed from 3.7 per cent of GDP in the December quarter, to around 3 per cent in the March quarter (Graph 33). ", " In line with the softer growth in world trade, growth in Australia's merchandise exports to most markets has eased over the past year (Table 10). Exports to Japan have fallen, while growth in exports to Europe has slowed. Exports to east Asia (excluding Japan and China), after falling over much of the past year, have increased in the latest three months in line with improving economic conditions in the region. ", " Over the past year, aggregate merchandise exports to the Middle East, China and India have increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span>, compared with overall export growth of just under 3 per cent. Exports to the Middle East rose by 12½ per cent over the same period, following annual growth of almost 22 per cent on average over the past five years. The main export market within the Middle East is Saudi Arabia, which is Australia's largest market for exports of motor vehicles and a major market for exports of live animals. Last year Saudi Arabia purchased about <span class=\"no-wrap\">$1.4 billion</span> worth of motor vehicles, equivalent to about one-third of the total value of motor vehicles exported. ", " Exports to China have likewise grown at a rapid pace, rising by almost 10 per cent over the year to the March quarter 2002 to reach nearly $8 billion. This places China as Australia's fourth largest export destination. The major goods exported to China are metal ores, such as iron, copper and nickel, as well as cotton, wool and petroleum. China's recent accession to the World Trade Organisation should help sustain further rapid gains in exports to China. ", " While India is less significant in terms of the value of exports, ranked as Australia's 12th largest export market, exports to India have experienced one of the fastest growth rates, rising by 30 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Coal, metal ores and textile fibres, such as cotton and wool, are India's main imports from Australia. ", " The rebound in export values in the March quarter was underpinned by a recovery in the value of resource exports, which had fallen sharply in the previous quarter (Graph 34). Exports of metal ores and minerals have been quite weak, though demand for aluminium and base metals is expected to improve this year owing to a recovery in demand in the major consuming regions of the US, Japan and Europe. The value of exports of coal, coke and briquettes has remained at a fairly high level over much of the past year, with capacity in the industry expected to rise modestly over the next few years as a result of increased profitability – in part a result of recent industry consolidation – and growing world coal demand; some stock rebuilding is also expected to occur. According to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE), mine production of gold is expected to fall slightly in 2002 following small declines in production in the two preceding years, primarily as a result of older mines coming to the end of their working life. Margins, however, remain quite positive, buoyed by the relatively high Australian dollar price of gold and reductions in production costs at new and existing mines. ", " The decision by the US to levy tariffs on steel products should have a relatively small direct effect on Australia's exports of steel, iron ore and coking coal, though the indirect effects could be larger. By volume, Australia produces about 1 per cent of world steel output, and exports account for a slightly smaller share of steel traded on the global market. Approximately one-quarter of Australia's iron and steel exports, worth about $400 million per annum, are destined for the US market; some 15 per cent of this will attract duty, since the steel tariffs apply only to specific types of steel beyond certain quantity thresholds. The indirect effect of the tariffs, however, may be significant. Australia faces more intense competition in third markets – the EU already has imposed tariffs of its own, ranging between 15 and 26 per cent, on imports of various steel products above a certain quota – and in the medium term the tariffs may lead to a lower volume of trade in commodities used in the production of steel, such as coal and iron ore. ", " Rural export values have fallen quite sharply over the past three quarters, albeit from a high level. As prices for rural commodities have remained firm, this has reflected quite a sharp fall in export volumes. Some of this fall is due to a reduction in the supply of wool as a result of historically low flock numbers and the rundown in the wool stockpile. According to ABARE, higher prices are expected to lead to a small rise in sheep numbers over the next year or two, though this is expected to be constrained by the significant capital investment undertaken by farmers who have switched to cropping from grazing over the past decade. The detection of mad-cow disease in Japanese cattle late in 2001 was a major setback for beef demand as consumer confidence in beef products was adversely affected (Japan accounts for more than one-third of Australia's beef exports). In contrast, a near record winter grain crop of almost 37 million tonnes is estimated to have been harvested in 2001/02. ", " Manufactured export values, which are sensitive to trading partner growth, have fallen in recent months and are around 2 per cent lower than the level in the March quarter 2001. The fall is the result of a decrease in the value of exports of machinery. In contrast, exports of transport equipment have risen by about 20 per cent over the past year and now account for 20 per cent of manufactured exports, compared with about 13 per cent in the mid 1990s. ", " Service exports, which are also sensitive to trading partner growth, have fallen slightly in value terms over the year to the March quarter. A recovery in these exports, however, appears to be underway. Short-term visitor arrivals rose by about 12 per cent in the quarter and are now around 2 per cent below the level prevailing last August, prior to the disruption to international travel following the terrorist attacks in the US (Graph 35). The recovery in arrivals has been strongest for the UK, east Asia, and to a lesser extent, the US. ", " Reflecting the strength of the domestic economy, the value of imports has recovered slightly following a period of negative growth for much of 2001 (Graph 36). The value of consumption imports rose by around 1 per cent in the March quarter, boosted by increases in imports of toys, books and leisure goods; imports of motor vehicles declined in the quarter after recording a large increase in the December quarter. After growing strongly in the second half of 2001, capital imports declined slightly in the March quarter, despite a pronounced increase in imports of civil aircraft; capital imports are now 9 per cent higher than in the March quarter 2001. Imports of telecommunications equipment remain very weak. The shift in domestic demand from dwelling investment towards more import-intensive business investment is likely to increase demand for imports, as might growth in manufactured exports, as inputs to these exports are also quite import-intensive. Service imports have risen in recent months, but are 4 per cent lower over the past year. ", " The net income deficit widened slightly in the December quarter to just below 3 per cent of GDP (Graph 37). This remains low in comparison with the past decade and a half, with the gradual accumulation of net foreign liabilities over that period being offset by the effect of lower global interest rates. Australia's total net foreign liabilities were little changed in the December quarter at around 60 per cent of GDP: net foreign debt fell to <span class=\"no-wrap\">$326 billion</span> in the December quarter, equal to 47 per cent of GDP, while net foreign equity rose slightly to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> of GDP. The trend over the past two years of strong net debt inflows continued in the quarter, with net equity inflows relatively subdued. ", " Commodity prices have moved higher this year as world economic prospects have improved (Graph 38, Table 11). In addition, political tensions in the Middle East have boosted oil prices (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-economic-developments\">International Economic Developments</a>’ for details). The RBA Commodity Price Index has risen by around 4 per cent in SDR terms since the beginning of the year; the index has fallen slightly in Australian dollar terms, reflecting the appreciation of the exchange rate, though it remains nearly 40 per cent higher than the low point reached three years ago. ", " Rural commodity prices have continued to rise and are now back around levels recorded in the mid 1990s. To some extent this reflects favourable supply developments in Australia's main rural exports. Beef and veal prices have held up as overseas producers rebuild herds following outbreaks of foot and mouth and mad-cow disease, while wool prices have also benefited from tight supply conditions resulting from the elimination of Australia's wool stockpile and reductions in the national flock. One exception to these developments has been sugar, with prices falling over the past 18 months owing to increased world production. ", " Non-rural commodity prices (excluding base metals) have edged higher since the beginning of the year. This mainly reflects the recent rise in the price of gold to above US$300 per ounce, buoyed by strong Japanese demand and safe-haven buying associated with increased tensions in the Middle East. Spot market prices for thermal coal have increased as world demand has recovered, though contract prices for both thermal and coking coal have not yet been settled for the contract year beginning in April. ", " Reflecting the improved prospects for the world economy, base metals prices have continued to rise from their lows recorded in October 2001. The rise in prices has been strongest for nickel – due in part to stainless steel producers aggressively cutting inventories of nickel last year – and copper. Aluminium has recorded a smaller price gain owing mainly to developments on the supply side of the market, including the prospect of a restart of idle capacity in the US and planned additions to capacity in China. ", " The improvement in the global outlook has also put upward pressure on prices of a number of industrial commodities which Australia imports. The Journal of Commerce index of industrial prices, which measures daily price movements in a collection of industrial metals, chemicals and building materials, has increased by 9 per cent in US dollar terms so far this year, recovering close to one-half of the fall that occurred through 2001. DRAM prices have also risen, with prices for 128 megabytes of DRAM, as measured by DRAMexchange.com, increasing from around US$1.30 in mid November to around US$3.60 in April. ", " During the course of 2001, official interest rates were eased by 200 basis points, to an historic low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.25 per cent</span>. This included several reductions in the second half of the year, which sought to anticipate the impact on Australia of a further weakening in the world economy. In the event, even though world economic conditions did deteriorate in late 2001, the Australian economy remained resilient. ", " Over the past few months, the steady stream of better-than-expected economic data released in Australia (against a background in which there has also been some improvement in the world economic outlook) has led markets to price-in a return of official interest rates to more normal levels over the course of 2002. By early May, markets had fully priced-in an imminent tightening of 25 points, with a further 75 basis points tightening over the rest of 2002. Against this background, the Bank's announcement of a 25 point tightening on 8 May caused little market reaction (Graph 39). ", " As a result of this move, the spread between cash rates here and in the US has increased to 275 basis points, the highest it has been since the early 1990s (Graph 40). Markets expect this could widen further in the months ahead due to the greater strength of the Australian economy. ", " Australian long-term bond yields have shown a net increase of 10 basis points in 2002. Yields rose sharply in the first half of March on the back of the strong GDP, retail sales and labour market reports and higher US bond yields. More recently, a substantial fall in US yields has caused local yields to fall. The Australian 10-year bond yield stood at 6.10 per cent in early May after reaching a high of over 6.50 per cent in mid March (Graph 41). ", " Reflecting the relatively strong economic outlook for Australia, the net rise in domestic long-term yields over the past three months has been larger than in comparable yields in the US. This continues a pattern that was evident through most of 2001. The spread between 10-year government bonds in Australia and the US moved through 100 basis points in early February, reaching 120 basis points in March, and has fluctuated around 105 basis points since (Graph 42). ", " The widening in the nominal spread between Australian and US 10-year bonds since early 2001 appears to have been largely matched by a change in the spread in real interest yields (on indexed bonds) between the two countries (Graph 43). As such, it appears that the widening reflects a favourable reassessment of Australia's real growth prospects relative to those for the US, rather than a deterioration in relative inflation performance. ", " Over the three months to early May, most corporate bond yields have risen by a few basis points more than government yields. For example, spreads on bonds rated A and better have risen by around 7 basis points since end January (Graph 44). Australian credit spreads remain well below those seen in the US (Graph 45). Strong demand for non-government bonds (see ‘<a href=\"#debt-markets\">Debt markets</a>’ below) continues to exert downward pressure on domestic credit spreads. ", " Issuance in the domestic non-government bond market reached a record high of $10.5 billion in the first quarter of 2002, of which about half was asset-backed securities and half direct bond issuance (i.e. not asset-backed) <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 46, Table 12)</span>. ", " The $5 billion of asset-backed securities issued in the March quarter was a record. The sector has also continued to diversify, as illustrated by the issue in March of $295 million of bonds backed by endowment policies (a form of life insurance policies which pay out a lump sum on the death of the policyholder or at the end of a fixed period). This marked the first time such receipts had been securitised anywhere in the world. Also, $76 million of commercial mortgage-backed securities were issued by a large listed property trust, marking the first subordinated debt issue by a listed property trust in the Australian asset-backed bond market. In addition, $500 million of non-conforming residential mortgages (i.e. higher risk mortgages such as those with high loan-to-valuation ratios) were securitised in March. ", " Direct bond issuance amounted to $5.1 billion in the March quarter. Non-residents' share remained at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> with more than half the value of issues by non-residents attributable to issuers who had not previously raised funds in the Australian market. Financial institutions' share of direct issuance picked up in the March quarter but is still well down on that seen a few years ago. Corporate issuance, at $1.1 billion, was well down compared with quarterly issuance in 2000 and 2001. Property trusts remain the predominant issuers in this group. ", " The total stock of private bonds on issue continues to grow. Until late last year, issues of direct bonds were the driving force behind this growth: the stock of direct non-government bonds outstanding rose by a monthly average of $1.1 billion between January 1998 and October 2001, with a steady flow of new issues substantially exceeding maturities of existing bonds (Graph 47). More recently, growth in the stock of direct bonds outstanding has slowed, because of heavy maturities. The increase in private bonds outstanding has mainly been in the form of asset-backed securities. ", " Survey data suggest fund managers have recently increased their appetite for AA, A, and BBB-rated securities rather than higher-rated bonds, although their holdings of speculative-grade bonds, i.e. those rated below BBB, remain minimal (Graph 48). (The survey includes funds managers' holdings of both domestically issued and foreign bonds.) This trend marks an unwinding of the run-up in AAA-rated securities' share in funds managers' portfolios through the second and third quarters of 2001. Consistent with the strong demand for lower-rated bonds, an Australian mining company recently chose to issue BBB-rated paper domestically rather than abroad as it had previously done. Nonetheless, many issuers prefer to seek credit enhancement of their bonds, opting to pay a credit insurance premium to ensure quick take up by investors. About 10 per cent of all direct bonds outstanding have been credit-enhanced. ", " Offshore bond issuance by Australian institutions was strong during the March quarter, totaling $12 billion compared to a quarterly average of $11 billion in 2001. This issuance was made up mostly of issues by <span class=\"no-wrap\">asset-backed</span> vehicles ($6 billion) and financial institutions ($5 billion). As mentioned in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International    and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, issuance of Australian dollar denominated bonds by foreign institutions into offshore markets has also been strong in recent months. ", " Australian share prices reached a record high in early March, boosted by the favourable news concerning the domestic economy and signs of improvements in the US economy. More recently, against a background of substantial falls in overseas share markets, local share prices have fallen somewhat. Over the past three months, share prices have shown a net fall of 3 per cent. This was less than the fall in US share prices, continuing the pattern since 2000 of greater strength in the domestic share market (Graph 49). The ASX 200 index remains only 5 per cent below its peak, while broadly based US indexes are down by about 30 per cent from their respective peaks. ", " The main beneficiaries of recent buoyancy in the Australian share market have been those companies whose profits are most sensitive to the economic cycle. Since end January, share prices in the industrials and energy sectors have risen the most (Graph 50). The telecommunications, information technology and health care sectors all recorded substantial falls. These sectors, however, account for only a small share of the market, together making up just 9 per cent of total market capitalisation. ", " Australian companies recently finished reporting their earnings for the second half of calendar 2001. While reported earnings of the 100 largest companies were 20 per cent below those reported in the corresponding period of the previous year, this mainly reflects one-off asset write-downs, particularly by financial and media companies, rather than a decline in underlying profitability (Table 13). The earnings of industrial companies other than those in the finance and media sectors fell by 8 per cent in 2001. These figures were also affected by abnormals, particularly Telstra's abnormal gain reported in the previous year. ", " Forecasts for earnings for industrial companies in the current year are for a rise of about 15 per cent. In contrast to the normal tendency for forecast earnings to be revised down as the year progresses, forecasts over recent months have remained steady, supported by strong economic activity (Graph 51). ", " The Australian price-earnings (P/E) ratio based on reported earnings is currently around 28, a level almost twice its long-run average of 14. This ratio has been driven higher in recent months by large abnormal losses. The P/E ratio based on forecast operating earnings has been much more stable but, at 16, is also above its long-run average. These Australian figures are, however, well below comparable US figures (Graph 52). In the US, the recent very poor profitability of companies has pushed the P/E ratio based on ‘as reported’ earnings up to 45. The P/E ratio based on forecast ‘operating’ earnings stands at 20. ", " Equity raisings were solid during the March quarter, with over $3 billion raised (Graph 53). Most of these funds were raised through a small number of large placements, with investor demand for these offerings strong. Very little of these funds were raised through initial public offerings, suggesting investors remain wary of newly developing companies. Notwithstanding the recent rise in the Australian dollar, strong resource prices have encouraged a number of small initial public offerings from mining companies. Mining companies accounted for almost a third of the number of initial public offerings, though only 9 per cent of funds raised in the March quarter. Most of the companies foreshadowed to list on the ASX in coming months are resource ventures. ", " Growth in margin lending for equities and managed funds picked up in the March quarter. Total margin debt grew by 9 per cent, the strongest growth seen since June 2001 (Table 14). The increase over the past year has been about 30 per cent. While some of this growth came from an increase in the number of people taking out margin loans, the average loan size also increased, rising by 4 per cent over the quarter. Nevertheless, it remains the case that holdings of margin loans are quite widely dispersed with less than 0.02 per cent of clients holding loans greater than $10 million. Both the average level of credit limit usage and average leverage fell slightly over the quarter. Average credit limit usage is now at its lowest level since December 2000, while average leverage is at its lowest level since the Bank began surveying margin lenders in September 2000. The average number of margin calls per day fell, in line with the fall in overall market volatility. In terms of the assets underlying margin loans, there was a small shift away from Australian shares (which now account for 60 per cent of underlying assets) towards managed fund investments. ", " Intermediaries' variable-rate housing loans, which tend to be set by reference to official interest rates, were unchanged between early December and early May, in line with steady monetary policy (Graph 54). At the time of writing, banks had not yet responded to the May tightening. ", " Term loans for small business were reduced by 5 basis points in early February (Table 15). This fall was a delayed response to the December cut in the cash rate. Such delayed and incomplete pass through of cash rate reductions to small business was evident throughout the second half of 2001, adding to a widening of margins that began in early 2000 (Graph 55). The widening has been more significant for loans secured by assets other than residential property, reflecting continued adjustment by banks to the higher risk of such loans. Despite the extent of the widening – as much as 55 basis points – the margin between the weighted average variable interest rate paid by small businesses and the cash rate has fallen slightly between September 1999 and December 2001, as businesses have switched to lower-priced products. ", " In contrast to the stability of variable rates, fixed rates have risen from their record lows of late 2000. These interest rates are set by reference to the market rates (i.e. swap rates) and the recent rise reflects increases in these market rates. ", " Overall, however, banks have cut their margins on fixed-rate loans. This has been particularly the case for the interest rate on 3-year housing loans, which has risen by substantially less than the swap rate since late 2001 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 56)</span>. ", " Fixed-rate housing loans have become more popular in recent months, increasing from 5 per cent of loan approvals in November 2001 to 8 per cent in February 2002. This increase in usage of fixed-rate loans has come despite the recent rises in fixed rates and the fact that fixed rates are the same as, or higher than, current variable rates. Expectations of imminent rises in official interest rates, which would normally be followed by rises in banks' variable rates, most likely contributed to the switching to fixed-rate loans. ", " Monetary policy was tightened by 25 basis points in May, lifting the cash rate to 4.5 per cent. Notwithstanding the tightening of monetary policy and a rise in market yields over the past quarter, financial conditions continue to be supportive of economic activity. This is evident in the low level of real rates, the positive slope of the yield curve and equity prices which, although below their peak, are still conducive to capital raisings. The real exchange rate is also at a level supportive of the traded sector, despite a steady appreciation since the beginning of the year. ", " The current level of the cash rate when expressed in real terms remains well below the average of the past decade, a period characterised by moderate inflation and output growth of around 4 per cent. It is possible to calculate three different measures of the real cash rate – using underlying inflation, bond market inflation expectations and inflation expectations derived from consumer surveys. All three measures show its current level is below the average over the period since 1992, but by different amounts (Table 16). The same calculations over the period since 1997, during which inflation has been around 2¼ per cent and output growth around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>, show that the current real rate is between ¾ to 1¼ percentage points below its average level. The narrower range probably reflects the fact that inflation expectations have become more aligned with actual inflation outcomes over the latter half of the 1990s. The average nominal cash rate over the period since 1997 is around 5¼ per cent, and 5¾ per cent for the period since 1992. ", " Using these three methods of calculating real interest rates, but applying them to variable interest rates charged by intermediaries for housing loans, results in estimates that show a larger gap below the decade average. This reflects the reduction in margins charged on mortgages over the 1990s (Graph 57). For business loans the variable rate in real terms remains below the average of the past decade by a comparable margin to the cash rate. Fixed interest rates charged by intermediaries, which account for a smaller share of business loans than floating rate funding, look less expansionary as they have risen by more than the rise in the cash rate over the past few months, reflecting movements in market yields. ", " The slope of the yield curve, as measured by the difference between the 10-year bond yield and the 90-day bank bill rate, remains positive and at a higher level than has been typical in recent years, but not exceptionally so <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 58)</span>. This generally means that short-term rates are lower than the levels expected to prevail in the longer term, a situation which is generally taken to indicate an expansionary policy setting. Growing confidence in a sustained economic recovery pushed long-term interest rates higher over the past three months, but this was more than matched by the upward movement in short-term interest rates. ", " Credit grew at an annualised rate of around 9 per cent in the six months to March, slightly above the rate recorded over the preceding six months (Graph 59). Credit expansion continued to be dominated by household borrowing, which grew at an annualised rate of around 15½ per cent in the six months to March, with borrowing for housing particularly strong, reflecting low interest rates and the impetus from the Government's First Home Owner Grant. In recent months the growth in housing credit has eased a little, following the moderation in housing loan approvals, but it remains at a relatively fast pace by historical standards. ", " Business borrowing was subdued over the six months to March, growing by 1¼ per cent on an annualised basis. Nonetheless, this represented an increased pace from the slight decline recorded over the preceding six months, and business loan approvals have picked up in recent months. As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’, an increased willingness to borrow by businesses is consistent with the improved investment outlook, although businesses should also be able to finance much of their investment from accumulated internal funds and equity raisings. ", " On the liability side of intermediaries' balance sheets, growth in the broader monetary aggregates has outpaced growth in credit, with annualised growth in broad money of 10½ per cent in the six months to March (Graph 60). This partly reflects rapid growth in bank deposits of businesses, as a result of the strength of their internal funding. Another factor has been a shift in bank balance sheets such that a greater proportion of their funding has been accounted for by issuing certificates of deposit (CDs) rather than bank bills. Since CDs are counted in the monetary aggregates, the switch has led to an increase in the broader monetary aggregates. With growth in domestically sourced liabilities outstripping that in assets, financial intermediaries have reduced their offshore borrowings over the past six months. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International    and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar rose against all the major currencies over the past three months. Over 2002 to date, the real exchange rate, which adjusts for inflation across our trading partners, has risen by around 4 per cent. For the competitive position of the import and export-competing sectors of the economy, the level of the real exchange rate is more important than changes, and the current level remains around 8 per cent below its 1990s average (Graph 61). ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.9 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Graph 62)</span>. The largest contributors to the rise in the quarter were a further rise in the price of holiday travel and accommodation, reflecting changes in the airline industry, and a number of seasonal price increases, including for pharmaceuticals and education. ", " As in the December quarter, the various measures of underlying inflation are providing somewhat different readings of inflationary pressures (Table 17). Statistical measures such as the weighted median and the trimmed mean suggest that underlying inflation has fallen from 3¼ per cent in the December quarter to just under 3 per cent in March. In contrast, exclusion measures continue to report underlying inflation of over 3½ per cent. The main reason for this divergence is that some of the items that have made the most significant contributions to year-ended inflation, such as meat prices and overseas travel, remain in the exclusion measures, whereas other items that have made large negative contributions to year-ended inflation, such as petrol, have been removed. As explained in <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>, the Bank's assessment is that the statistical measures are currently providing the more accurate reading on underlying inflation. ", " The largest contribution to the CPI in the March quarter was made by holiday travel and accommodation prices (particularly the overseas component), which increased by 4.7 per cent in the quarter and by 11.3 per cent over the year. Some of this price rise reflects the introduction of air passenger ticket and insurance levies at the end of last year. In addition, there were seasonal price increases for several items, including pharmaceuticals, which increased by 11.4 per cent in the quarter but by only 1.5 per cent over the year, and education, which increased by 4.7 per cent in both quarterly and year-ended terms. Partially offsetting these rises, small price falls were recorded in the quarter for a range of household furnishing, household appliance, clothing and footwear items. Fruit and vegetable prices also declined by 1.6 per cent in the March quarter, partially unwinding the <span class=\"no-wrap\">10.2 per cent</span> increase in prices recorded in December. ", " In addition to the effect of the higher cost of holiday travel and accommodation, the annual inflation number was boosted by meat prices, which increased by 12.3 per cent as a result of supply constraints in world markets, and household insurance prices, which increased by 7.0 per cent following recent upheavals in that industry. The price of petrol, however, fell by 8.9 per cent over the year, reducing CPI inflation by around ¾ of a percentage point. Audio, visual and computing equipment prices also fell by 3.5 per cent over the year. ", " Tradables price inflation (excluding petrol and food) picked up sharply over the course of 2000 and 2001 in response to the depreciation of the exchange rate (Graph 63). In recent quarters, tradables inflation has stabilised, suggesting that the peak impact of the exchange rate depreciation on the inflation rate may have been reached. Reflecting the strength of the domestic economy, non-tradables inflation has picked up in recent quarters. ", " Producer prices, which provide a measure of input costs, continued to moderate in the March quarter, as another sharp fall in the price of oil and declines in the prices of a number of other imported items largely offset moderate price increases across a range of domestic items. At the final stage of production, prices rose by 0.2 per cent, to be 2.0 per cent higher over the year (Table 18). Price pressures at earlier stages of production have also moderated significantly from year-ended growth rates of around 10 per cent in late 2000. Intermediate-stage and preliminary-stage prices fell by 0.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent in the quarter. ", " With crude oil prices, as measured by the producer price index, falling by 13 per cent in the March quarter, some of these differences in the quarterly price movements reflect the higher weight of crude oil prices at earlier stages of production. Abstracting from oil, the falls in imported components of producer prices were fairly uniform, with declines of between 2¼ and 2¾ per cent in the March quarter. This partly reflects the appreciation of the Australian dollar in the quarter and continuing downward pressure on the prices of goods such as industrial machinery and electrical equipment owing to weak global demand. On an industry basis, the largest producer price increases were for real estate agent services, some business services and, to a lesser extent, the construction sector. ", " Business surveys suggest that upstream cost pressures are generally subdued, though it appears that they are no longer declining and cost increases are more widespread than they have been in recent quarters (Graph 64). The economy-wide NAB survey reported that purchase costs increased by 0.4 per cent in the March quarter and that expected increases in purchase costs in the June quarter have edged higher. According to the manufacturing-based ACCI-Westpac survey, the net balance of firms experiencing and expecting cost increases remained steady in the March quarter. ", " Most measures of wage pressure remain contained reflecting the subdued conditions in the labour market throughout 2001 (Graph 65). The Wage Cost Index rose by 3.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter. At the industry level, the fastest wage growth continues to be in the education (4.4 per cent) and finance and insurance (4.2 per cent) industries, while the retail sector again recorded the slowest growth (2.4 per cent). ", " Data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations database on enterprise bargaining agreements also indicate modest wage pressures. New federal enterprise agreements ratified in the December quarter provided an average annualised wage increase of 3.8 per cent, the same as in the previous quarter. However, the average annualised wage increase of renegotiated private sector agreements in December was 4.2 per cent, <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 percentage points</span> higher than for the agreements that they replaced. Wage increases under existing agreements have edged up over the past year or so, but remain at 3.7 per cent. ", " According to the latest Mercer <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em>, the base salary of executives increased by 4.6 per cent over the year to March, which is down slightly from the pace of around 4¾ to 5 per cent reported in the previous couple of quarters. Salaries of all office-based workers increased by 4.0 per cent over the year to March. ", " Wage bill measures have been running somewhat faster than the wage rate measures, partly reflecting compositional factors such as shifts in the share of low- and high-paid workers. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings of full-time adults (AWOTE), grew by 1.2 per cent in the December quarter to be 5.8 per cent higher over the year. Similarly average hourly earnings based on national accounts data rose by 1.1 per cent in the December quarter to be 5.5 per cent higher over the year. However, strong growth in labour productivity has meant that unit labour costs fell over much of 2001. ", " Firms continue to report little difficulty attracting suitable labour, according to the NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys. Growth in total labour costs reported in the NAB survey was also subdued in the March quarter, with firms expecting this to continue in the June quarter. ", " The Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) is currently hearing the 2002 Safety Net Review of award wages. The AIRC is considering an application by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to increase all award rates of pay by $25 per week. The Federal Government is arguing for a $10 per week pay increase for low-paid award workers. Last year, the AIRC granted between $13 and $17 per week across the award scale. A decision is expected in the coming weeks. ", " According to the Melbourne Institute survey, inflation expectations of consumers have remained in a range between 3½ and 4½ per cent since mid 2000, though expectations for the year ahead rose to 4.5 per cent in April, from around 4 per cent earlier in the year (Graph 66). Business surveys provide mixed readings on inflationary pressures. The economy-wide NAB survey suggests that businesses' inflation expectations are currently well contained, with inflation in final product prices expected to be 0.4 per cent in the June quarter, and 0.5 per cent for retail price inflation. In contrast, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey, which covers the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors, indicates that the proportion of firms expecting prices rises in the next three months has increased significantly since December. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of investors, measured by the difference between 10-year bond yields and indexed bonds, have moved slightly higher in recent months to average around 2½ per cent in the March quarter. Financial-market economists surveyed by the Bank have revised upwards their forecasts for inflation following the release of the March quarter CPI data. The median inflation forecasts for the years to June 2002 and June 2003 are 2.8 and 2.5 per cent respectively (Table 19). In contrast, trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), revised their expectations for inflation down slightly this quarter, although they remain a little higher than financial market expectations. ", " Consistent with the forecasts presented in the February <em>Statement</em>, CPI and underlying inflation were just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> in the March quarter, slightly lower in year-ended terms than in the December quarter. As in the February <em>Statement</em>, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is likely to ease gradually to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> by the end of 2002. This reflects the fact that wage and labour costs remain contained as a result of the subdued labour market conditions in 2001, and that price pressures stemming from the exchange rate depreciation in recent years should lessen. ", " However, this is likely to be the trough in inflation. The recent labour force data suggest that stronger domestic activity has started to flow through to labour demand: employment growth has accelerated and the unemployment rate has fallen. With output and employment growth expected to remain firm over the remainder of this year, capacity constraints are likely to emerge and exert upward pressure on wages and prices. ", " Upstream price pressures are currently well contained, due to earlier falls in oil prices and import prices over the past year. However, cost pressures arising from higher insurance premiums and increased electricity and gas costs may increase pressure on business margins. Moreover, the rise in oil prices in recent months will also place some pressure on business margins as well as directly boosting CPI inflation in the coming quarters. ", " Against this, there is unlikely to be any significant impetus to inflation from import prices in the foreseeable future, assuming, as always, that the exchange remains at recent levels. The appreciation of the exchange rate in recent months should act to offset any remaining inflationary pressure from the earlier depreciation and may have some disinflationary impact. While the downward pressure on world prices is likely to dissipate somewhat with the recovery in world demand, this is unlikely to be sufficiently rapid to create significant inflationary pressure. ", " Consequently the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is likely to ease to around 2½ per cent by the <span class=\"no-wrap\">end of 2002</span>, but will subsequently be under gradual upward pressure, reaching the top of the target by around the end of 2003. The rise in oil prices, if sustained, will result in higher CPI inflation outcomes than this in the near term. ", " Risks to this assessment can be identified in both directions. Downside risks to the world economy still remain, and if realised, would be likely to result in lower growth in domestic output and weaker labour market outcomes, leading to less inflationary risk from a pick-up in wages growth and reduced scope for price increases. In such circumstances, downward pressure on world prices would continue, leading to further moderation in import prices. A further downside risk to the inflation outlook would arise if the exchange rate continues to appreciate, increasing the disinflationary impulse from imported inflation. ", " On the other hand, there is a risk that the recent turnaround in the labour market will lead to stronger wage inflation than currently allowed for, or that the pick-up in wage inflation will emerge sooner than expected. In addition, economic growth may be stronger than anticipated, allowing firms to build margins and exhausting the excess capacity in the economy more quickly. A further risk is that the rise in oil prices, combined with the recent higher quarterly CPI outcomes may lead to a ratcheting up of inflation expectations and, in turn, inflation. Such outcomes would result in inflation rising above the target sooner than anticipated. ", " Economic conditions in Australia and the US have diverged markedly over the past couple of years. The US economy experienced a sharp slowdown in 2001 – with year-ended growth in GDP declining from around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> in mid 2000 to ½ per cent in December 2001 – before beginning to recover towards the end of the year (Graph A1). In Australia, economic growth slowed in the second half of 2000, with year-ended growth in GDP reaching a trough of 1½ per cent in the December quarter 2000, before rebounding strongly to over 4 per cent by the end of 2001. Much of the slowdown in Australia reflected the large swing in dwelling investment associated with the changes to the tax system in the middle of 2000 – excluding dwelling investment, year-ended growth in output only declined to 2½ per cent. ", " This disparity in the growth rates of the two economies is reflected in the labour market, where employment has increased by nearly 2 per cent in the year to the March quarter in Australia, while over the same period it has declined by around 1 per cent in the US. The index of consumer sentiment in Australia has been much stronger than similar indices in the US. In part reflecting the differing levels of resource utilisation, underlying inflation has picked up in Australia over the past couple of years to be just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span>, while in the US the CPI (excluding food and energy) has remained steady through this period and is currently a little under 2½ per cent (Graph A2). ", " The divergence of the two economic cycles, in part, reflects a number of imbalances in the US economy, particularly relating to the corporate sector, that are not present in the Australian economy. Over 2001, corporate profits in the US declined by over 6 per cent but, over the same period, grew robustly in Australia. Consequently, the profit share in the US has declined in the past two years to be well below its long-run average, whereas in Australia the profit share has remained relatively constant around its historical average. ", " This contrast between the corporate sectors in the two countries has been reflected in their share markets. The Australian share market reached an historical high in March 2002 and has risen by 8 per cent over the past two years. It is currently only 4 per cent below its peak. Since reaching its peak in March 2000, the US share market has fallen by around 30 per cent. ", " Over the past five years, the value of funds invested offshore by Australian funds managers has increased from $53 billion to $127 billion.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " Some commentators have pointed to rising investments abroad as a factor contributing to the fall in the Australian dollar over this period. Others have gone further to argue that, because funds under management are increasing quickly and the proportion invested offshore is rising, this will be a negative long-term influence on the Australian dollar. ", " This Box puts recent flows by funds managers in perspective and concludes that there is no empirical support for these conjectures. ", " The proportion of funds invested abroad by funds managers has been rising throughout the period for which figures are available (since the late 1980s). The ratio was about 10 per cent in those earlier years, and has now risen to about 20 per cent (Graph B1). Throughout this period, the exchange rate has risen and fallen on several occasions, so any correlation with the exchange rate is, at best, a loose one. ", " The same process has been taking place in other countries, as part of the globalisation of financial markets. As such, the international flow of funds is not just one way; Australia is also the recipient of funds from foreign funds managers. ", " Foreign investment statistics published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics give some indication of the relative magnitude of these flows. Over the past decade, Australian portfolio equity flows abroad have averaged $3.5 billion a year, while foreign portfolio equity flows into Australia have averaged about twice that amount (Graph B2). That is, in net terms, more funds have been flowing into Australia than flowing out. ", " What is clear from the graph, however, is that foreign flows into Australia are quite variable. Inflows completely ceased during 2000, for example, a period when the Australian equity market became quite unfashionable among international investors who at that time were still focused on technology stocks. ", " While the exchange rate of the Australian dollar fell during 2000, suggesting that the cessation of foreign flows into Australia did influence the exchange rate, there does not appear to be any systematic relationship between these investment flows and the exchange rate. In 1997 and 1998, for example, when the currency was also falling, equity flows into Australia were rising strongly and Australian portfolio investment abroad fell. Both these were the reverse of the flows that might have been expected to result in exchange rate weakness. ", " One of the reasons why there is no systematic relationship between these portfolio flows and the exchange rate is that they are only part of the overall capital flows into and out of Australia. Direct investment by companies, and overseas borrowing and lending, are also important. Over the past year, foreign direct investment abroad by Australian companies was about twice as large as investment abroad by funds managers (Graph B3). Reliable conclusions about the exchange rate therefore cannot be drawn simply on the basis of portfolio flows. ", " Some commentators have also pointed to the increased flow of funds abroad, both by funds managers and companies, as a sign of a lack of investment opportunities in Australia. But this ignores the flows from abroad coming into Australia, which on balance have greatly exceeded the outflows from Australia. The existence of a current account deficit provides the overriding evidence that Australia has an excess of investment opportunities over savings. ", " Rather than being a sign of some structural deficiency in the Australian economy, the flows of investment abroad should, more appropriately, be seen as part of the internationalisation of the economy. This process is taking place in most developed countries and brings many benefits to the economy. It does not imply depreciation of the domestic currency or a problem with domestic asset markets. In particular, at the same time as Australian money is looking abroad, fund managers in many other countries are also looking to invest internationally, and many of these are finding Australia an attractive place to invest. ", " House prices in Australia have been rising strongly for some time, with increases of the order of 15 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> being recorded over the latest year in several of the major cities. While increases of that magnitude are not exceptional in a single year, a feature of the current expansion is that strong rates of increase have been sustained for several years, so that the cumulative increase in house prices has been substantial (Graph C1). ", " To put these increases in perspective, it is useful to compare the experience of recent years with the previous period of rapidly rising house prices, which occurred in the late 1980s. One important difference between the two periods is that most of the increase in house prices in the late 1980s was concentrated in a two-year period ending in the first half of 1989, a period of extremely rapid house price inflation. By contrast, the recent experience has been characterised by less extreme increases in any given year, but with strong rates of increase being sustained over a longer period. The cumulative movements in the two episodes are summarised in Table C1. ", " The aggregate nominal increase in house prices in the late 1980s period, at 114 per cent, was much larger than in the most recent five years, but this difference is largely accounted for by the fact that the general rate of inflation was higher. In real terms, the cumulative increases are of similar magnitude, at 49 per cent in the late 1980s compared with 41 per cent in the recent period. However, in the current period, house prices are still rising; the CBA/HIA measure recorded a further large rise in the March quarter 2002. Another noteworthy feature of these comparisons is the geographic spread of house price increases. The rise in prices in the late 1980s was heavily concentrated in Perth and Sydney (and to a lesser extent, in Melbourne), whereas this time house price rises have been experienced in most of the major cities, with particularly large increases in Melbourne. ", " An alternative benchmark for assessing house prices over time is to express them as a ratio to average earnings (Graph C2). This ratio rose rapidly in the late 1980s to peak at around 6½ in 1989 (that is, the average house price was 6½ times annual average earnings). It then fell for two years, and remained steady for a period in the early to mid 1990s. The ratio has been on a rising trend since 1996 so that currently, at just under 8 times earnings, it is well above its previous peak. ", " A rising trend in the ratio of house prices to incomes may in part be a natural consequence of improving living standards. As incomes increase, households can afford to devote an increasing share of their income to housing. The growth in the number of two-income households will have contributed to this trend. In addition, it appears that the rise in house prices in recent years partly reflects the adjustment to the low-inflation environment. The low nominal borrowing rates that have resulted from lower inflation (as well as increased competition in the home-lending market) have increased the scope of households to borrow by reducing the front-end hurdle of the standard home loan. This has been reflected in the rapid growth of household borrowing over the past five years. ", " But whenever an adjustment of this type occurs, there is the risk that prices may overshoot, as some purchasers extrapolate past movements as a guide to future capital gains. This may be occurring at present, since the low rental yield on property, and high rental vacancy rates, seem inconsistent with rapidly rising house prices. Moreover, further downward pressure on rental yields may be in prospect as additional dwellings under construction are completed, especially in the medium-density sector. Some of these properties will be made available for lease at a time when vacancy rates have risen in all capital cities to high levels. The rise in vacancy rates has been most pronounced in Sydney and Melbourne where they are now among the highest in the country, especially compared with their long-term average levels (Table C2). ", " Although Australia's inflation target is expressed in terms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), it can be useful when assessing inflationary trends to focus on underlying measures which abstract from short-run volatility. ", " The CPI is often affected by movements in the prices of component items such as fruit, vegetables and petrol that reflect fluctuations in supply conditions and generally do not persist for more than a quarter or two. For example, in the December quarter 2001 a 10 per cent increase in the price of fruit and vegetables contributed around ¼ of a percentage point to CPI inflation, but these prices then fell slightly in the March quarter. Adjustments to government charges and taxes can also sometimes have large ‘once-off’ effects on the level of prices which do not lead to a persistent rise in the rate of inflation. ", " There are two common ways of obtaining a measure of underlying inflation. One approach is to exclude nominated items from the CPI basket (the <strong>exclusion</strong> approach). Typically, the excluded items are those that are volatile and/or display pronounced seasonal patterns, and those that are subject to administrative price setting. An alternative approach is to exclude all extreme individual price movements, from whatever source (the <strong>statistical</strong> approach). While statistical and exclusion measures can move differently from quarter to quarter, they tend to follow similar trends to the CPI in the medium term (Graph D1). ", " Two widely-used exclusion measures are the ‘CPI excluding volatile items’ and ‘market goods and services excluding volatile items’, both of which are published by the ABS in the quarterly CPI release. ", " The CPI excluding volatile items measure excludes the prices of items that are particularly volatile (fruit, vegetables and automotive fuel), retaining just over 90 per cent of the CPI basket. The market goods and services excluding volatile items measure focuses on prices determined in the market sector of the economy and covers around 80 per cent of the CPI basket. In addition to the volatile items noted above, the market goods and services excluding volatile items measure excludes prices for goods and services that are to a significant extent provided by the public sector, such as urban transport fares, health service fees, and state and local government rates and charges. ", " These exclusion measures should be treated with some caution for a couple of reasons. First, they can still be affected by temporary movements in the prices of items that are not excluded. For example, over the past year the rise in the prices of overseas travel and meat has been unusually large by historical standards, boosting these measures by around ½ per cent. Second, the decision about which components to remove is somewhat arbitrary. By excluding specific components all the time, <em>all</em> information contained in those components – including that reflecting genuine underlying forces – is lost. ", " In recent years there has been considerable research into statistical measures of underlying inflation. Two such measures calculated by the Bank are the ‘trimmed mean’ and the ‘weighted median’.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> In contrast to exclusion measures, statistical measures utilise all components of the CPI in their calculation. ", " Each quarter, the CPI components, and their weights in the CPI, are ranked by the size of their price movement in the quarter. The trimmed mean is calculated as the weighted mean of the central 70 per cent of the quarterly price change distribution of all CPI components; that is, the top and bottom 15 per cent of the distribution are trimmed. In practice many of the ‘volatile’ items removed from the exclusion measures considered above will often be excluded from this measure too. However, the trimmed mean excludes extreme movements in any item, while small movements in usually volatile items will remain in the calculation. The weighted median is the inflation rate for that item which is in the middle of the total distribution of price changes; that is, it trims away all but the midpoint of the distribution so that half the component weights are on one side of the median, and half on the other. ", " Statistical measures also have their shortcomings. One of the most important is that they are harder to interpret than exclusion measures. It is not always clear what information is being preserved and what is being excluded in a statistical measure, whereas this is unambiguous in the case of an exclusion measure. ", " Although the Bank targets CPI inflation, quarter-to-quarter volatility in the series (in particular ‘once-off’ price movements in specific components) means that it is useful to look at measures of the underlying trend in inflation. There is, however, no single, unambiguously precise measure of underlying inflation. In practice, the Bank's approach is to monitor a variety of measures and, while remaining aware of their individual strengths and weaknesses, take all of these into account when trying to gauge the underlying trend in consumer prices. Currently, the Bank's judgement is that underlying inflation is around the same as CPI inflation at just under 3 per cent. "], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2002/may/1.html"},

The rapid fall-off in dwelling construction came to an end around the turn of the year. With household consumption and government spending moving ahead, and the trade sector of the economy adding to production, real GDP recorded a solid rise in the March quarter, despite a substantial reduction in business inventories. On the basis of information currently available, it seems likely that further good growth occurred during the June quarter. ", " In the period immediately ahead, the housing sector will be recovering to more normal levels of activity, underpinned by the fact that the long-term requirement for new dwellings almost certainly exceeds the number of commencements currently occurring. In addition, lower interest rates, the subsidy for first-home buyers, and some moderation in construction costs are providing strong impetus to the upturn. On the basis of the leading indicators, this pick-up, which can be expected to get under way in the current quarter, could well be quite rapid. Non-residential building activity, which has been subdued for some time, is also likely to pick up over the coming year. These developments will translate into higher levels of activity in the manufacturing sector in due course. ", " The firmer short-term outlook has been reflected in higher levels of confidence. While businesses continued to report relatively subdued trading conditions in the June quarter, a significant lift in measures of confidence about the period ahead was apparent across a wide range of surveys. Consumer confidence has also recovered strongly. ", " As yet, there has been no improvement in the labour market, which is still showing the effects of the period of reduced growth last year. Employment has been static for some months, with the number of full-time jobs declining significantly. Vacancies data suggest little short-term improvement, though they appear to have stopped falling, and business surveys are signalling a firming in employment intentions. Labour markets in the construction and manufacturing sectors will enjoy firmer conditions during the coming year, while some areas of service sector employment, which have been strong up to now, show signs of weakening. The unemployment rate has risen by about a percentage point since mid 2000 and, even though economic activity has already picked up again, is likely to increase further before reaching a peak. ", " There is some risk that continued weakness in the labour market in the period immediately ahead will undermine household income and hence consumption growth. But upside influences on domestic demand growth can also be identified, given the possibility of a rapid run-up in housing construction. In addition, financial conditions are accommodative and, with the Australian share market performing much more strongly than overseas markets, there has not been the reduction in wealth as has occurred elsewhere. ", " In fact, the main downside risks to the Australian economy's growth prospects now come from abroad. Such risks have increased in recent months, as the global manufacturing slowdown which began in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United States</span> last year has spread to Japan, most of the rest of Asia and Europe. US manufacturing is experiencing a contraction similar in intensity to that of a decade ago, though to date the willingness of US households to continue expanding their consumption spending – albeit at a reduced pace – has kept the US economy from encountering a general recession. Tax cuts and the substantial easing by the Fed so far in 2001 are supportive of the US economy, though the high level of the US dollar and continued weakness in share markets are working in the opposite direction. ", " In Asia, manufacturing production has fallen sharply in a number of countries which had hitherto been growing strongly. The global cycle in information technology is the key driver here. These economies benefited as suppliers to the information technology investment boom of recent years, but are equally exposed to the ensuing slump. Major Asian economies (and Australian trading partners) such as Japan and Korea are affected, as are Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan. To date, China's economy, which is less internationally exposed than most others in Asia, has continued to expand quite quickly. European growth has also slowed more than expected. ", " The tendency in the early part of the year for assessments of global growth to be marked down has continued over the past few months. Most observers still expect a pick-up in global growth in 2002, assisted by relatively easy global monetary policy settings, fiscal expansions in the US and Europe, and lower oil prices. To the extent that what is being observed is a relatively conventional business cycle, this appears to be a reasonable expectation. But there is always something unique in each cycle which means that average cyclical experience cannot be automatically assumed to apply. In the current episode, the very rapid pace of investment in information technology in recent years in the US (and to a lesser extent elsewhere) raises the question of whether there is an overhang of such capacity and, if there is, how long that will take to work off. ", " Hence the global scene warrants careful attention. A continued trend to simultaneous weakness in all the major regions of the world economy, if it occurred, could be expected to impart a disinflationary impulse to prices of traded goods and services. A number of commodity prices (though not those most important to Australia) have already weakened. There would also be, of course, impacts on the volume of business experienced by Australian exporters and import-competers, which would in due course feed through to weaker incomes and softer domestic demand conditions than otherwise. ", " The low level of the Australian dollar is, to a degree, insulating the domestic economy from external weakness. Net exports have continued to make a significant contribution to aggregate demand, and the current account deficit looks to have fallen to around 2 per cent of GDP in the June quarter, a level not seen for about two decades. The exchange rate has at times during recent months again come under downward pressure, though it has remained noticeably above its early April lows. The Bank has intervened in the market from time to time to provide support when market sentiment seemed to be unreasonably bearish. ", " The trend in inflation in Australia has been as hard to assess in the past year as that of economic activity because of the complexity of the effects on the price level of tax reform and changes in the exchange rate. A year ago, price data suggested a gradual but clear build-up in inflation had been under way for a year or so. At that stage, with the exchange rate low and growth robust (but with monetary policy having been tightened), the Bank expected inflation to be in the upper part of the 2–3 per cent target during 2001. Six months ago, that forecast looked too high, as the September and December quarter CPI results were both lower than expected, and in the February <em>Statement</em>, the Bank revised down its estimate of the then current rate of underlying inflation to around 2 per cent. As that and other <em>Statements</em> have explained, there were a number of difficulties in interpreting these data. Were the expected effects of the GST and other tax changes smaller than anticipated? Or was their timing simply delayed, with businesses temporarily absorbing cost impacts in their margins? And where were the expected effects of the low exchange rate? ", " Both the CPI results in 2001 to date, in contrast, have been a little higher than generally expected. For the year to June 2001, the CPI increased by 6.0 per cent. Of this, net tax effects may have contributed something approaching 3 percentage points, and the direct effect of rising petrol prices almost a further half a percentage point. This calculation, together with several measures of core inflation, suggests that underlying inflation net of tax effects was around 2¾ per cent for the year to June 2001 – in other words quite close to what was forecast a year ago. It appears that the temporary compression of margins in late 2000 is being gradually unwound, and that the effects of tax and exchange rate changes are being more fully passed on. ", " In the case of exchange rate effects in particular, these impacts are unlikely to be complete yet, so that somewhat elevated quarterly price rises might be observed for a while. Hence the Bank expects that underlying inflation will be around 3 per cent on an annual basis in the near term, before declining to around 2½ per cent through 2002. The fact that growth in labour costs has been well-contained, and is likely to remain so, underpins this forecast. Inflation as measured by the CPI will be affected by these same trends, but – assuming current oil prices and exchange rates – the decline in petrol prices currently being observed is likely to bring the annual CPI inflation rate down a little, to below the underlying rate of inflation during the next few quarters. ", " Since April, the Bank has not made any change to the stance of monetary policy, after three relatively rapid reductions in interest rates earlier in the year. With the change in the domestic economic news for the better and the resulting improvement in sentiment, the Bank judged that the stance of policy had been adjusted sufficiently to address the domestic downside risks to growth. In addition, current and near-term inflation is a little higher than it appeared a few months ago. ", " With a central forecast for inflation of around 3 per cent, as one-time influences on the price level are absorbed, it is quite possible that observed rates of inflation above that figure may be recorded. But provided that this is a temporary phenomenon – which would depend on inflation expectations remaining well-anchored, and wages growth remaining moderate – it would not call for a tightening of monetary policy. Policy must, instead, be set with a view to influencing the inflation outlook over the slightly longer term, beyond the period heavily affected by these short-term influences. The current stance of policy seems well-attuned to this task, but there are conflicting currents which could shift the balance of risks in either direction. The Bank is continuing to assess the outlook, including the effects of the recent improvement in domestic conditions and of the deterioration in the international environment. As always, the Bank is prepared to adjust monetary policy as required, in pursuit of sustainable growth consistent with the inflation target. ", " Conditions in the global economy have become more subdued over the past few months, with weaker-than-expected growth being recorded in the euro area and across most countries in Asia. In contrast to the Asian crisis, where the slowing in growth was concentrated in the emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, in this episode the slowing has been more widespread across both industrialised and emerging market economies. The slowdown in the US has clearly been central to these developments, as has the related contraction in the global information technology and communications sector, after several years during which this sector had underpinned strong growth across many countries (Graph 1). A feature of this slowdown has therefore been the significant and synchronised slowing in many countries' manufacturing sectors (Graph 2) and a contraction in global trade. In some cases this slowing has, in turn, been exacerbated by a weakening in domestic demand. ", " Although inflation concerns remain in some countries, wage growth has remained well contained, and there is some evidence that the weakening in global demand may be leading to a softening in global manufactured goods prices. Across the world, the inflationary effects of the earlier pick-up in oil prices are now starting to abate. In Europe, higher food prices and the inflationary effects of the lower euro have increased inflation more recently, although these effects should be temporary. ", " The US economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the June quarter and by 1.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 3)</span>. A sharp fall in business investment, combined with a considerable run-down in inventories, has driven the softening in growth over the first half of 2001, although this has been partly offset by continued resilience in consumer spending and a pick-up in dwelling investment. ", " Although the weakness in US growth was initially concentrated in the traditional manufacturing industries, profits and production have now fallen across a wide range of industries including the information technology and communications (ITC) sector. Overall, industrial production has fallen by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> since the peak levels recorded in September last year, and as a result capacity utilisation rates have fallen markedly. This, combined with the very high levels of investment that have occurred in recent years and the possibility that there has been some degree of over-investment, implies that business equipment investment may remain subdued for some time. ", " A broadly based weakening in employment growth is a further indication that the slowdown has now spread across the economy. The level of employment has fallen since the beginning of the year in the wholesale trade and manufacturing sectors, with the fall in the latter sector being by far the most severe. Reflecting the weakness of demand and falling production levels, the average number of hours worked in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors has also been lower, on average, this year than in the second half of 2000. The unemployment rate has gradually increased from its low point of 3.9 per cent in October last year to 4.5 per cent in July. ", " A range of indicators, however, suggest that the outlook for the US economy may be stabilising (Graph 4). In part, this may be attributed to the 275 basis points decrease in the Fed funds rate since January and the expansion of fiscal policy that has taken place via lower marginal tax rates and the one-off tax rebate paid mid year. Both manufacturing and other firms are beginning to show a little more optimism, as indicated by the NAPM index, and new orders in the manufacturing sector appear to be stabilising. Consumer sentiment has increased a little and remains above its long-run average level, and forward indicators in the housing sector point to continued growth. ", " Notwithstanding these developments, downside risks to the outlook remain. By most assessments the US stock market remains highly valued, despite the correction that has taken place since early 2000, and there is a risk that further adjustments of the share market will have contractionary effects. Combined with continuing weakness in the labour market, further corrections in household wealth holdings could dampen consumer spending. As mentioned above, it also appears possible that there will be a protracted period of low levels of investment, following the very high levels of investment of the past few years. On the other hand, the considerable correction in inventories that has taken place in the first half of 2001 would suggest that much of the production adjustment to the inventory overhang that developed last year has now occurred. ", " Both wage and consumer price inflation have increased over the past couple of years, although they have remained below previous cyclical peaks (Graph 5). Easing energy prices have exerted downward pressure on inflation in recent months, with consumer price inflation now at 3.3 per cent, and producer prices easing considerably. While core inflation has continued to drift up, to be running at 2.8 per cent compared with around 2½ per cent a year ago, growth in the wages component of the employment cost index (ECI) has remained around its level of the past year, at a little under 4 per cent, and growth in the benefits component of the ECI has eased a little. ", " The slowdown in the US has contributed to a slowing in growth in the rest of the Americas. In Canada and Mexico, real output growth began weakening towards the end of 2000 as US demand for these countries' exports declined. Year-ended growth of the Canadian economy has slowed from 5 per cent in March 2000 to 2½ per cent in March 2001. The Mexican economy has contracted sharply, with negative growth in output being recorded in both the December and March quarters and year-ended growth falling to 2 per cent, down from nearly 8 per cent a year earlier. The Argentine economy has experienced little growth in nearly three years and significant price deflation. In recent months this has been accompanied by a credit squeeze, as concerns have been raised about the country's ability to service its debt, leading to a significant increase in the interest rate charged on US dollar denominated Argentine debt. These problems have been exacerbated by Argentina's exchange rate regime; the Argentine peso is pegged via a currency board to the US dollar, with the strength of the US dollar in recent years resulting in a significant competitive disadvantage on the traded goods sector in Argentina. (Further details are provided in the ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’ chapter.) In Brazil and Chile, although growth has weakened it has remained positive, with a depreciation of each of these countries' exchange rates providing some offsetting stimulus. Financial markets in these countries, however, have been adversely affected by the problems in Argentina. ", " After recording strong growth in the last quarter of 2000, the national accounts suggest that the Japanese economy contracted slightly in the March quarter and indications are that conditions deteriorated further in the June quarter (Graph 6). In the March quarter, public investment offered the only substantial positive contribution to growth. ", " External demand and investment, which had been the significant drivers of growth during the preceding few years, weakened sharply in the first half of 2001. The weakening in global demand for ITC goods, particularly in the United States, has been especially important and has been translated into weaker export volumes (Graph 7). Exports have fallen by over 13 per cent since their peak in August last year, with exports of electronics goods being around 25 per cent lower. This has contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and weaker equipment investment. ", " The weakening in activity has led to a deterioration in conditions in the labour market. Employment has fallen sharply over the past few months, more than unwinding the growth in the second half of 2000, and job offers are on a downward trend, suggesting the weakness in employment will continue in the near term. These developments, together with subdued income growth, have contributed to a softening in consumer sentiment to below the average level recorded in the 1990s. Consumer spending continues to be weak, particularly taking into account the temporary boost to spending that recent tax changes are likely to have caused in the March quarter. Against this background, prices continue to fall, with core consumer prices being 0.6 per cent lower in June 2001 than a year earlier. ", " The slowdown in non-Japan Asia that began towards the end of 2000 continued during the first half of 2001, with only the Chinese economy continuing to expand at a robust pace (Graph 8). The slowing has been most pronounced in those countries that had benefited most from the boom in global demand for electronic goods in recent years. In those countries, weakness in exports has generally been accompanied by a weakening in domestic spending. Overall, however, growth in the region during this year and the next is still expected to be well above growth rates recorded during the Asian crisis. ", " As in Japan, the speed and severity of the downturn in non-Japan Asia's exports and manufacturing production has been significant (Graph 9). After increasing by 27 per cent over the year to June 2000, the region's exports fell by 6 per cent over the year to May 2001. As mentioned above, the contraction in global demand for ITC equipment has been the major factor behind this turnaround, with exports of ITC equipment from the major electronics-producing countries having fallen by around 33 per cent since the peak recorded in August last year. The decline in exports has, in turn, led to falls in business confidence, industrial production, business investment and imports (reflecting the large imported component in the region's exports). ", " Consumer spending has also softened, after a couple of years of reasonably strong growth. Consumption is being affected by falling asset prices and declining consumer confidence in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea, with rising unemployment also being a factor in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In many of these countries, fiscal measures have been announced to provide support to domestic demand, and central banks in Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines have responded to the deterioration in external developments and weaker domestic spending by further easing monetary policy. Interest rates have also fallen in Hong Kong in line with US rates. ", " In contrast to much of the region, the Chinese economy has continued to grow strongly, as expansionary fiscal policy and high levels of foreign direct investment have supported robust domestic demand. While export growth has moderated in recent quarters in response to the global demand slowdown, with a buoyant domestic economy, relatively less exposure to the ITC sector and exports comprising around 25 per cent of GDP – a much smaller share than for most other countries in the region – the impact on overall growth has been minimal. ", " The New Zealand economy has slowed significantly over the past year; real output expanded by under 1 per cent over the year to the March quarter, down from 5½ per cent over the year to March 2000. Net exports have remained a source of growth, with the low New Zealand dollar offering some insulation from the slowdown in the world economy. Consumer spending has also held up well. Investment spending, however, has softened in line with weaker business confidence. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand reduced official interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75 per cent in May, citing the further slowdown in world growth. Consumer price inflation remains marginally above the RBNZ's target band, although it has come down from its recent peak in <span class=\"no-wrap\">December 2000</span>. ", " Growth in Europe eased a little over the six months to the March quarter, with domestic demand slowing quite sharply and exports weakening in some regions, although it has remained around the average level recorded over the second half of the 1990s (Graph 10). Indicators suggest that a further moderation in growth is likely to have occurred in the June quarter, given the further falls in industrial production and the weakening in retail spending that has taken place. Similar to developments elsewhere in the world, the manufacturing sector in Europe has slowed significantly more than the rest of the economy, with industrial production in both continental Europe and the UK experiencing declines from their peaks late last year. Across Europe, the manufacturing sector has experienced large falls in both domestic and foreign orders and confidence. ", " At this stage, Europe's prospects, however, remain relatively positive. Business confidence, for example, although having weakened significantly in recent months, has remained around levels of the mid-1990s slowdown, and well above levels reached in the early 1990s (Graph 11). Consumer confidence has also weakened a little, but remains well above the average level recorded in the 1990s. In part, the strength of consumer confidence may reflect the relatively stronger performances of the European labour markets to date. Although employment in the euro area as a whole fell in the March quarter, the unemployment rate has remained at its recent low. The UK labour market has recorded stronger growth, and the number of unemployed persons continued to decline in June. Fiscal policy has also been eased across many European countries during the past year, and although this has not yet had the expected stimulatory effect on consumer spending, it should provide some support to domestic demand in the period ahead. ", " Inflation in the euro area has risen in 2001 to reach its highest level since the introduction of the euro in 1999. It has been boosted by increases in food prices, related to livestock diseases and adverse weather conditions, and energy prices, due to the combined influences of higher global oil prices and the lower euro. Measures of core inflation have also increased steadily over the first half of 2001, from around 1.5 per cent to just over 2 per cent, possibly reflecting the second-round effects of earlier oil price rises and pass-through from the depreciation of the euro. In part as a result of these developments, the European Central Bank has eased monetary policy by only <span class=\"no-wrap\">¼ of one percentage</span> point this year, although at 4.5 per cent, the policy rate is not high by historical standards. Inflation in the UK also increased strongly earlier in the year, reflecting food and energy price rises, but at 2.4 per cent remains within the Bank of England's target band. The Bank of England has cut interest rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage</span> point this year, taking its policy rate down to 5 per cent. ", " Private-sector forecasts for world growth in 2001 have been revised down to 3.1 per cent in recent months, largely reflecting the weaker developments to date. For the industrialised countries as a group, the slowing is now expected to be close to that experienced in the early 1990s, though less protracted (Graph 12). Global growth is expected to pick up to around 4 per cent in 2002, on the back of a reasonable rebound in the US. ", " The widespread easing in both monetary and fiscal conditions around the world, and particularly in the US, since the beginning of the year should support such an outcome, although downside risks remain. A recovery in the US economy during 2002 is central to this outcome, but it is possible that the resolution of the remaining imbalances in that economy could constrain growth for a longer period. It is also possible that the synchronised slowing in growth across such a large number of countries will have self-reinforcing properties, through both trade channels and confidence, which will impede the recovery. On the other hand, the relatively benign inflationary environment and the reasonable state of most countries' fiscal balances should enable policy-makers to take further steps to support growth in the event that these risks were to be realised. ", " Central banks in most developed countries have continued lowering interest rates in recent months, though at a slower pace than earlier in 2001. In the US, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut the Fed funds target by 25 basis points in late June, after five cuts, each of 50 points, earlier in the year (Graph 13). At that meeting the Fed maintained its easing bias, and later, Chairman Greenspan further reinforced market sentiment that another cut may be forthcoming when he gave evidence before the US Congress in July. He noted that the period of sub-par economic performance is not yet over and that further weakness may require some policy response from the Fed. Reflecting this assessment, markets are now expecting a 25 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate at the meeting later this month and some likelihood that rates may be eased further later in the year. ", " Easings by other central banks continue to be less than those in the US. Among the English-speaking countries, aside from the easing in Australia, which is discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’, the Bank of Canada has cut the overnight cash rate this year by 150 basis points to 4.25 per cent, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Bank of England</span> by 100 points to 5 per cent, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand by 75 basis points to 5.75 per cent (Graph 14). All cited weakening prospects for world economy growth as a major factor behind the latest moves. ", " In Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) eased rates by 25 basis points in May, to 4.50 per cent, its first easing this cycle. With inflation well above its 2 per cent target, the ECB has so far resisted calls for further cuts despite signs of a deterioration in the economic outlook. European rates are now above those in the US for the first time since late 1994. The Swiss National Bank cut rates by 0.25 per cent in March and has since left them unchanged at 3.25 per cent. The Swedish central bank moved against the global trend, increasing its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 4.25 per cent, in July as inflation breached the upper limit of its inflation target band <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 1)</span>. ", " The Bank of Japan (BoJ), having earlier reduced interest rates to zero, has changed its operating objective for monetary policy from an interest rate target to a quantitative target for bank reserves. Further deterioration in the Japanese economy recently has led to speculation that the BoJ may seek to ease monetary policy by increasing its reserves target from the current 5 trillion yen to 6 trillion yen over coming months. Concerns over the state of the banking sector once the mark-to-market accounting rules are implemented in September have also added to calls for a more expansionary policy. To date, however, the BoJ has resisted such calls. ", " Many Asian economies, including Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have eased monetary policy over recent months as the extent of the economic slowdown has become more apparent. However, several other emerging market economies have had to raise interest rates, despite slowing output growth, to counter exchange rate pressures. Included in this group are Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey and Brazil, but pressures were most acute in Argentina, where the government has had difficulty in rolling over maturing securities. Short-term interest rates in Argentina spiked to over 90 per cent, compared with around 10 per cent early in the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graphs 15 and 16)</span>. ", " After falling from around 6.50 per cent in May last year to 4.75 per cent in late March 2001, yields on <span class=\"no-wrap\">10-year</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">US Treasury</span> bonds increased significantly over April and May, peaking at 5.50 per cent (Graph 17). The sharp increase seemed mainly to reflect confidence that the Fed's cuts to official interest rates would succeed in promoting a quick recovery in the US economy. As noted below, this sentiment was similarly reflected in a substantial recovery in US equity markets. Since late May, however, yields have fallen again, to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.00 per cent</span>, as optimism regarding the economic outlook has dissipated in the face of continued weak economic data and disappointing corporate earnings results. ", " Changing views about the economic outlook have also been reflected in yields on corporate bonds. So far this year, the general trend has been for spreads to US Treasuries to fall, despite episodes when increases in risk aversion have temporarily pushed yields higher. Developments in Argentina in July, for instance, saw spreads across all risk classes move higher, as investors sought compensation for the increase in risk of holding corporate securities in such an environment (Graph 18). While spreads on the highest quality credits rose only marginally, yields on lower-rated corporate bonds have been much more volatile. ", " In European bond markets, yields have followed a similar, though more subdued, pattern. After falling steadily from around 5.30 per cent in the middle of last year to 4.60 per cent in late March 2001, yields on German 10-year government bonds increased significantly over April and May, peaking at 5.20 per cent. As in the US markets, however, bond yields have fallen somewhat since late May to their current level of around 4.90 per cent. ", " Yields on Japanese long bonds, having fallen to a low of almost 1.00 per cent in late March, rose to 1.50 per cent by mid April. This upward movement was in part driven by the improved financial market sentiment seen globally, but was also aided by increased political uncertainty ahead of the election for the President of the Liberal Democratic Party (Japan's dominant political party). Yields moved lower from late April, as the economic outlook deteriorated. The move was reinforced by expectations that the BoJ would increase its outright purchases of long-term government bonds and by confidence that the new Prime Minister Koizumi would tackle the country's entrenched economic problems. By early August, however, continued economic deterioration led markets to question the government's fiscal consolidation plans, pushing yields back up to <span class=\"no-wrap\">around 1.35 per cent</span>. ", " Developments in emerging markets have been dominated by events in Argentina, where concerns about the sustainability of exchange rate arrangements, and the ability of the government to meet debt repayments, have led to several large spikes in bond yields over recent months. The spread between Argentinian bonds and US Treasuries rose to over 16 percentage points at one stage in July, after averaging around 7 percentage points in the first half of 2001. ", " Contagion from events in Argentina resulted in rising yields throughout Latin America, particularly Brazil. A significant impact was also noticeable in European emerging markets but the contagion to emerging Asian markets has been relatively small, with spreads increasing by only around 20 basis points (Graph 19). Even though economic activity has been very weak in the Asian region over the first half of 2001, the finances of countries in this region, both public and external, generally remain in good shape and investors have seen little need to demand higher risk premia. ", " World share markets have been volatile so far this year, around generally declining trends. Having fallen sharply during the March quarter as the outlook for the global economy deteriorated and earnings expectations fell, markets rallied in April and May in response to falling interest rates. Markets assumed that this would lead to a quick recovery in economic activity and therefore company profits. ", " More recently, optimism about the rebound in economic activity, particularly in the US, has faded in the face of continued weak economic data. Together with a further deterioration in the corporate earnings outlook, this has caused equity markets to weaken significantly again. Earnings from companies in the S&amp;P 500 index declined by around 17 per cent in the year to June 2001 with earnings growth expected to remain negative in the September quarter. This has seen share prices for companies in the Wilshire and S&amp;P 500 fall on average by around 10 per cent since their recent highs in May, with the technology-rich Nasdaq companies down by around 15 per cent (Graph 20, Table 2). Compared with the record highs last year, US equity prices are down by around 25 per cent for broader-based indices and by 60 per cent for the Nasdaq. ", " Despite the falls this year, share prices remain high relative to traditional measures of share valuations, such as price earnings ratios. The current P/E ratio of around 26 for the S&amp;P 500, for example, remains well above its historical average of 16, even though it is down from the recent peak of 36 (Graph 21). P/E ratios of technology stocks remain particularly high, despite the sharp fall in these share prices. The P/E ratio for the S&amp;P technology index, for example, is around 46 (Graph 22). ", " Share prices in other industrialised countries have generally taken their lead from the US. The German Dax and UK FTSE staged a temporary rally over April and May, but have come off by around 10 per cent since then. The decline in the Japanese Nikkei was also temporarily halted over April and May before deteriorating sentiment, both in Japan and in global markets in general, came to the fore. Heightened concerns about the size of the non-performing loan book for Japanese banks also depressed Japanese share prices. While the Nikkei reached new post 1990 lows, this in part reflected a distortion resulting from the re-weighting of the index in 2000. A more accurate indicator of share prices in Japan is provided by the Topix index, a much broader-based index of equity prices. It has fallen by around 15 per cent since its recent peak in early May, but remains within its 1990s range. ", " Share prices in Asian emerging markets have had a mixed performance in 2001. In aggregate, Asian (excluding China and Japan) share markets have fallen 14 per cent, but the performance has varied markedly between economies. While several of the larger markets have seen big falls, such as a 21 per cent decline in the Hong Kong Hang Seng index, others have seen solid rises. The Thai stock market, for example, has risen 20 per cent so far in 2001. In Latin America, the share market in Argentina has fallen by 23 per cent so far this year, with the negative effects impacting strongly on Brazil, where the stock market has fallen almost 10 per cent. ", " The US dollar's sustained appreciation since 1997 has continued for much of 2001 to date. On a trade-weighted basis, it reached a 16-year high in early July, but since then has fallen a little as investors seem to have become more concerned that the US economy may not rebound as quickly as previously thought (Graph 23, Table 3). ", " A perception that the strong US dollar is hurting US exporters has also helped make investors more cautious about buying US dollars. While it is too early to say that the US dollar has peaked, several of the factors that have been underpinning its relentless rise over recent years have faded this year: the US economic outlook deteriorated more rapidly than elsewhere over the beginning of 2001; equity prices in the US have fallen sharply; last year's interest rate differential in favour of the US has been eliminated relative to most other countries as the Fed cut policy rates more than other central banks; and the US productivity gains of recent years have moderated. ", " Adjusting for the effects of differing rates of inflation in its trading partners, the US trade-weighted dollar is now 16 per cent above its 30-year average, and about 35 per cent higher than its low in the mid 1990s (Graph 24). This is its highest level since January 1986. Indeed, since 1973 (when the major currencies began to freely float) the US dollar has only spent 22 months above its current level – between March 1984 and January 1986 – a period widely seen as a US dollar bubble. ", " Currencies of those emerging market economies that float have generally fallen significantly against the US dollar so far in 2001, with the largest decline being a 21 per cent fall recorded by Brazil, largely in response to the ongoing difficulties of its largest trading partner Argentina. The Chilean peso has also declined, by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span>, while the Thai baht has fallen 7 per cent (Graphs 25 and 26). ", " Since the start of 2001, the Australian dollar has fallen by 7 per cent against the US dollar (Graph 27, Table 4). There have been three phases in the exchange rate during this period: ", " It can also be seen from the graph that the trade-weighted index, while following the same general pattern as the rate against the US dollar, has fallen considerably less. In net terms for the year, the TWI is down by only about half the fall in the US dollar rate. This continues a pattern that has been evident since 1997, and is to a large extent due to US dollar strength depressing our exchange rate against it. ", " Our exchange rate against other currencies has not fallen as much as against the US dollar. In fact, in the period since 1997, there has been little net change, on average, in our exchange rate against major currencies apart from the US dollar and the yen (Graph 28). Against a group of currencies comprising the euro, pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar and Swedish krona, the Australian dollar's average exchange rate remains close to its decade average. ", " Because the US dollar is moving independently against most other major floating currencies, the exchange rates of these currencies against the US dollar are showing a high degree of correlation with each other. The Australian dollar's close correlation with the euro over the past couple of years has been much discussed, but the Australian dollar's correlation with other currencies has also increased. ", " Rising interest differentials relative to the US have been supporting the currency, as they have contributed to a noticeable increase in demand for Australian debt instruments, not only from the US and Europe, but also from Japan. The fact that the Australian dollar's exchange rate against the yen has been relatively steady over the past 12–18 months is adding to Japanese investor confidence in Australian dollar investments. These flows are not yet reflected in capital flow data, which for the most part only extend to the end of 2000. (Capital flows in recent years are described in <a href=\"#box-a\">Box                                    A</a>). ", " The Bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market on a number of occasions this year, most recently in July when it bought A$297 million to support the currency. This took intervention in the year to date to $1.3 billion, still a relatively small amount. Transactions with the Commonwealth Government (in 2001 to date) resulted in sales of foreign currency equivalent to A$2.6 billion which were largely offset by interest received on the Bank's holdings of foreign securities and transactions with other institutions, so that the impact on net reserves was limited to that coming from intervention operations. ", " The Australian economy recovered in the first half of 2001 after a small contraction in the second half of 2000. According to the latest national accounts, real GDP rose by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter, to be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> higher over the year (Table 5, Graph 29). An important factor behind this was that falls in dwelling investment, which had been exceptionally large in the two quarters following the introduction of the new tax system in the middle of 2000, abated. According to the national accounts, businesses ran down inventories built up over the second half of 2000, with the stock rundown subtracting nearly 2 percentage points from GDP growth in the March quarter. But this was more than offset by a large increase in consumption and a substantial contribution from net exports. The improvement in growth in the March quarter was evident across all states, although growth over the year remains relatively subdued in both New South Wales and Queensland. ", " Recent indicators suggest that the economic rebound has continued. Consumer spending has picked up and there is evidence of an improvement in business confidence, aided by more accommodative monetary policy settings. The weakness of the labour market poses a risk to consumer spending, although the forward indicators of labour market conditions appear to be stabilising. The strong turnaround in most of the leading indicators of housing activity suggests a robust recovery in the housing sector is in train. This should have a positive flow-on in the second half of the year to those industries adversely affected by the sharp slowing in the construction industry. While businesses may still be holding unwanted inventories, which could slow the recovery in production, a significant part of the adjustment has probably already occurred. Capital spending by businesses has been weak, but firms are expected to boost investment spending in 2001/02. ", " In contrast to the fairly favourable developments on the domestic front, the international environment will be much less supportive of growth over the year ahead than it has been over the past couple of years. Weaker demand for Australia's exports, coupled with stronger domestic demand for imports, are likely to reduce the contribution to growth from the external sector, although this should be offset to some extent by the competitive effect of the lower exchange rate. ", " Consumption increased strongly in the March quarter, following two softer quarters, and was nearly 4 per cent higher over the year. Retail sales data suggest that this strength continued into the June quarter as sales rose by 1 per cent in volume terms. Consumption of services has exhibited the strongest growth over the past year, in spite of the relatively greater increase in the price of most services over this time. The strength has been particularly noticeable in the areas of health and insurance and financial services. Expenditure in both of these areas has been boosted by the increase in private health insurance coverage. According to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, <span class=\"no-wrap\">45 per cent</span> of the population was covered by private hospital insurance at the end of March 2001, compared with around 30 per cent prior to the introduction of the health insurance rebate at the beginning of 1999. This has resulted in an increase in household spending on <span class=\"no-wrap\">private-sector</span> health services, as well as an increase in insurance premiums (net of claims) being paid to health insurers. Growth in the consumption of insurance and financial services has also been supported over the past couple of years by strong growth in financial intermediation and superannuation. ", " The consumption of goods, in contrast, was weaker over the first half of 2001, with only sales of furnishings and clothing and footwear enjoying strong growth. There was some evidence of discounting by clothing retailers in the early part of the year in an effort to rundown large inventories. Motor vehicle sales, after rising strongly following the tax-related price falls in the middle of 2000, have subsequently fallen. Higher prices have contributed to the decline, with motor vehicle prices, as measured in the CPI, having reversed all of last year's tax-related fall by the June 2001 quarter. ", " Assessing the trend in retail sales over the past couple of years has been complicated by the disparate movements in sales recorded by small and large retailers. Sales by small retailers grew at an annual rate of 15 per cent over the six months to June, around double the rate recorded by the group of large retailers, whose sales tend to grow at fairly steady rates (Graph 30). This contrasts with conditions in the same period last year, when small retailers recorded rates of growth less than half that of the large retailers. Some of the difference may relate to the impact of sample rotation of small retailers that occurs in the first month of each quarter (the large retailers are fully enumerated) and appears, at times, to have led to discrete changes in the level of sales recorded for small retailers. ", " Real household disposable income rose in the March quarter to be 2½ per cent higher over the year (Graph 31). Real household spending is likely to have been boosted in the first half of 2001 by a fall in retail petrol prices and a decline in the household interest burden. According to the Australian Institute of Petroleum, retail petrol prices increased by 23 per cent over 2000. Over the past couple of months, however, retail petrol prices have fallen by more than 10 per cent. ", " The household interest burden eased in the first half of 2001, notwithstanding the continued strong growth in household debt. The lowering of official interest rates in the March quarter resulted in household interest paid decreasing by 0.3 of a percentage point in the quarter, to be around 7½ per cent of household disposable income. It probably declined further in the June quarter, as the reduction in official interest rates over the first half of the year was reflected more fully in lending interest rates. Household debt grew strongly over the first half of the year, increasing at an annual rate of around 14 per cent. Moreover, the recent strength in loan approvals data suggests that growth in lending for housing will increase further in coming months. Personal credit growth has moderated a little, though it remains solid, driven by strong increases in credit card and overdraft lending. Household loans in arrears have remained at low levels. ", " Consumer sentiment, as measured by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute, has rebounded and is now above its long-run average (Graph 32). During the first half of 2001, this measure of consumer sentiment was particularly volatile, with the timing of the swings being closely related to the release of economic news. The sharp fall in sentiment in March followed the release of the weaker-than-expected December quarter national accounts, while the strong rebound in June followed the release of the stronger-than-expected March quarter national accounts. If the recent rise in confidence is sustained, it should be supportive of growth in consumption. ", " In the March quarter, the value of household assets is estimated to have risen by just over 1 per cent, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> higher over the year (Table 6). Dwelling prices rose in the quarter, while the value of household financial assets was unchanged. The value of household assets probably rose further in the June quarter as domestic share prices rose by around 11 per cent in the quarter. The increase in the value of household assets over the past year is relatively small by the standards of the annual growth rates recorded in the latter part of the 1990s. Nevertheless, as a result of these earlier gains, wealth is substantially higher, relative to current income, than historical norms. ", " A recovery appears to be underway in the housing market, supported by increased affordability and government incentives. Dwelling investment recorded modest growth in the March quarter, following exceptionally large falls in the two preceding quarters, which subtracted about 2¼ percentage points from growth in GDP. The leading indicators of housing activity suggest a robust recovery in the second half of the year. The value of housing loan approvals has increased by about 50 per cent since its low point in October 2000, and now exceeds the previous peak in February 2000 (Graph 33). Loans for existing dwellings are now well above previous peaks, and this appears to be flowing through to construction. Loans for construction have recovered most of last year's fall and building approvals rebounded sharply in May and improved further in June. ", " The Commonwealth Government's First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) scheme has had a positive influence on the housing market. The impact of the grant, which was enhanced for new home buyers in March, is evident in an increase in the proportion of first home buyers receiving housing finance, as well as a reduction in the average value of building approvals in the three months following the extension of the scheme. Information provided by various State Revenue Offices indicates that, following the extension of the scheme, the number of grants paid rose strongly in May and increased further in June. While the FHOG has provided stimulus to the housing sector in all states, its effect appears to have been disproportionately large in the smaller states, where median house prices are lower than in the two largest states. ", " The speed of the housing recovery has, however, been impeded in some states by the collapse of HIH Insurance and the subsequent delays in the re-issuing of insurance to builders previously insured by HIH. These delays were due to the volume of applications, the limited number of alternative insurers – in most states there are only two or three alternative providers of builders' warranty insurance – and tighter financial criteria that these new insurers are applying to some builders. Delays, which in some cases have been several months, appear to have been most pronounced in New South Wales due to the large number of former HIH policy-holders in that state; delays elsewhere appear to be largely abating. The delays in processing building approvals may have postponed some dwelling activity which otherwise would have occurred in the June quarter until the second half of the year. ", " The recovery in the housing market has been reflected in rising house prices. According to ABS and REIA data, house prices in capital cities increased by around 2 per cent in the March quarter and by 7 per cent over the year. House prices in Melbourne and Canberra have recorded the largest increases over the year, rising by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span>, while growth in house prices in Sydney and Hobart has been relatively subdued. ", " Experience among different industries has varied considerably. Output of the construction industry, which fell by 24 per cent over the second half of 2000, rose in the March quarter, reflecting the modest recovery in the residential market. The flow-on effects of earlier sharp falls in construction activity, however, continue to hamper other industries, particularly manufacturing, where output fell further in the March quarter. In contrast, service industries continued to perform well, particularly property and business services, finance and insurance, and communication services. Growth in these industries has cushioned the effects of weakness in construction and related activity, though these industries may experience slower growth over the remainder of the year, reflecting weaker global conditions (particularly in the IT sector) and increased familiarity with the new tax system. ", " Aggregate demand for goods rose above production in the March quarter, enabling firms to unwind some of the inventories accumulated over the second half of 2000. A sizeable rundown of inventories was reported by the manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade industries in the March quarter. In aggregate, the turnaround in inventory accumulation subtracted almost 2 percentage points from growth in GDP in the quarter. Nevertheless, inventory-to-sales ratios at the industry level suggest that further falls in inventories are in prospect (Graph 34). This is consistent with a number of business surveys, which suggest a further reduction in stocks in the June quarter, particularly in the retail industry. ", " There are some signs of a recovery in business sentiment, though the improvement to date has mostly been confined to expectations of future conditions rather than the assessment of actual business conditions. The latest quarterly survey conducted by NAB reported a further fall in actual business conditions in the June quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 35)</span>. While well above the lows recorded in the early 1990s recession, they remain below levels recorded in the mid-1990s slowdown. Consistent with subdued output growth over the past year, the weakest business conditions were reported by the construction industry and some parts of the manufacturing and retail industries. Business confidence about the September quarter, however, has rebounded and is now above its long-run average. Other business surveys, such as the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturing and the Dun and Bradstreet survey of the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors, provide similar results. The Yellow Pages survey of smaller businesses continues to report weaker conditions and less optimism about the future. This is likely to be due to the large share of small businesses in the construction and related industries. ", " Most of the quarterly survey responses were received before the release of the March quarter national accounts in June. There is evidence from the monthly surveys that the better-than-expected outcome has resulted in a more favourable assessment by the business sector of the outlook. The reduction in official interest rates and signs of a recovery in the construction industry may also explain some of the improvement. ", " Business investment has been relatively subdued over the past couple of years and, as a share of GDP, is around its average over the last 15 years (Graph 36). Business investment increased by 2 per cent in the March quarter, underpinned by growth in each of the major asset components, but is only slightly higher over the past year. One of the brighter spots has been mining investment. Underpinned by buoyant profitability and high commodity prices in Australian dollar terms, investment by the mining industry again rose significantly in the March quarter, suggesting that the two-year decline in mining investment may have come to an end. ", " According to the March quarter ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey, the outlook for machinery and equipment expenditure remained quite positive, despite the uncertain global economic outlook and low level of business sentiment. Growth in nominal terms was expected to be around 8½ per cent in 2001/02, implying similar growth in real terms as the effect of the exchange rate depreciation has tended to offset the trend decline in machinery and equipment prices. While much of this growth was expected to occur in the mining sector, investment by the property and business services and utilities industries was also expected to contribute significantly. Business expenditure on motor vehicles, which represents around one-quarter of investment in machinery and equipment, should be boosted this year by the Government's decision to introduce more favourable tax treatment for business purchases of motor vehicles from 23 May, although the positive impact of this change will be partially offset by the recent increase in motor vehicle prices. ", " The outlook for expenditure on buildings and structures, which as a share of GDP is only slightly above its early 1990s lows, has improved, with indicators suggesting a build-up of projects that will commence in the second half of 2001. Non-residential building approvals rose strongly in the June quarter, though they are only slightly above levels recorded a year ago. The increase in the quarter was broadly based across shops, factories, offices and warehouses, which comprise around two-thirds of non-residential building activity. The Jones Lang LaSalle survey indicates some softening of conditions in CBD office property markets, but data from the Property Council of Australia suggest a continued fall in vacancy rates. The positive outlook for buildings and structures is supported by the Capex survey, which reported a substantial increase in expenditure intentions for 2001/02, and the Access Economics Investment Monitor. Particularly strong increases have been recorded in the mining and transport and storage sectors. ", " Expenditure on intangible fixed assets rose modestly in the March quarter, well down from the robust pace of growth of recent years. Expenditure on mineral and petroleum exploration accounted for much of the increase. In contrast, expenditure on computer software (around 80 per cent of intangible fixed investment) fell slightly, its first quarterly fall since 1995. ", " Corporate sector profits, as measured by GOS, grew strongly in the March quarter, retracing much of the previous quarter's fall. Profits as a share of GDP remained slightly above their average for the past decade (Graph 37). Around half of the growth in profits in the March quarter (excluding abnormals such as foreign exchange gains and losses) was due to the continued strong profitability of the mining sector, which has benefited from stronger output and the high level of commodity prices in Australian dollar terms. A number of larger corporates have recently announced earnings downgrades for the first half of this year, suggesting that profit growth may be weaker in the June quarter. ", " Small business profitability, as measured by the GOS of unincorporated enterprises, grew by just over 2 per cent in the March quarter, but remained flat over the year. The recovery in the March quarter probably reflects stronger retail sales and the modest turnaround in the construction industry (sectors where small businesses are well represented). The Yellow Pages survey of smaller businesses, however, suggests that profitability in the June quarter was weak. ", " While the outlook for investment is positive, relatively weak investment expenditure in the first half of the year is consistent with subdued growth in external financing by the business sector. Business credit grew by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> on an annualised basis over the six months to June, well down from the pace of around 13 per cent in mid 2000. Non-intermediated debt and equity raisings in the first half of 2001 were well down on the previous year. With debt raisings outpacing equity raisings, the corporate debt to equity ratio (based on book values) continued to move higher in the March quarter, although it is still considerably below the levels reached in the early 1990s. The debt-servicing burden of corporates eased slightly in the March quarter due to the easing in monetary policy and growth in corporate profits (Graph 38). ", " The Commonwealth Government announced its 2001/02 budget in May. The Commonwealth budget recorded an underlying cash surplus of $2.3 billion in 2000/01, which is expected to decline to <span class=\"no-wrap\">$1.5 billion</span> in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2001/02</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 7)</span>. New policy decisions taken since the release of the Government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) included increased spending on defence, the Government's innovation package, welfare reform and roads, as well as the removal of indexation on petrol, which has reduced projected revenues. ", " The Commonwealth budget had an expansionary impact on growth in 2000/01. Using the change in the surplus between fiscal years as a rough guide, the revised surplus in 2000/01 was more than 1½ per cent of GDP lower than in the previous financial year. In 2001/02, the fiscal position is estimated to remain broadly neutral. In aggregate, the states probably provided some fiscal stimulus in 2000/01, though the stance is expected to be slightly contractionary in 2001/02. ", " Employment data have been volatile of late. However, the increase in the number of unemployed, the concentration of employment growth in part-time jobs and the low level of job vacancies suggest that conditions in the labour market remain weak. Employment increased by 0.3 per cent in the June quarter to be a little over <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> higher than a year ago but fell in July (Graph 39). Growth over the past year has been confined to part-time employment, with the number of persons employed on a full-time basis falling. This trend may in part reflect a decline in hours worked by some workers previously classified as full-time to below the 35 hour a week threshold used by the ABS. The unemployment rate continued to rise in the June quarter, averaging <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.9 per cent</span>, compared with 6.5 per cent in the previous quarter, and remained at 6.9 per cent in July. ", " The weakness in the labour market since its peak in the September quarter has been mainly in the cyclically sensitive sectors. In the most recent period, employment in retail trade rose strongly, consistent with the recent strength in retail spending, while employment in the property and business services sector fell (though employment in this sector was still 4 per cent higher over the year to May). Robust growth in public-sector employment over the past year has been largely driven by rising employment in health and community services. ", " Employment in construction has shown surprising resilience over the past six months, falling by less than 50,000, or around 6 per cent, since the peak last August. In contrast, output of the construction industry has fallen by more than 20 per cent since mid 2000 (Graph 40). As a result, measured productivity of the sector has recorded a very large decline. Some labour hoarding may have occurred in anticipation of a recovery in the sector, but work done and hours worked by construction companies may have also been particularly difficult to measure accurately around the middle of 2000. Moreover, the historical relationship between output and employment appears to have diverged somewhat earlier, in 1998/99, with output in the industry rising much more strongly than employment at that time. ", " Output per hour worked in the non-farm economy, a measure of overall labour productivity, slowed over the course of 2000. A period of negligible productivity growth was also recorded during the course of the mid-1990s slowdown, before productivity began to grow relatively quickly as the expansion continued. In recent quarters productivity has increased by around 2½ per cent on an annualised basis, reflecting the sharp decline in hours worked towards the end of 2000 and the rebound in output growth in the March quarter. ", " The labour market weakened to varying degrees in every state over the first half of the year (Table 8). Accordingly, most state unemployment rates have increased from their most recent trough, with pronounced increases recorded in Western Australia and Queensland. In contrast, the Victorian labour market has so far been more resilient than that of the other states, as it has been less affected by the downturn in the construction industry. Consistent with the relative strength of the labour market and the economy more generally in recent years, Victoria has been experiencing inflows of interstate migrants for the first time in many decades (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> on Interstate Migration). ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand provide a somewhat mixed picture of prospects for the labour market over the near term (Graph 41). The two measures of newspaper job advertisements appear to have steadied at around levels recorded in the mid 1990s. The ANZ Bank newspaper job advertisements series fell by 4 per cent in the three months to July and is 34 per cent lower than a year earlier. The more volatile index of skilled vacancies compiled by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) fell by 1 per cent in the three months to July, but is <span class=\"no-wrap\">24                                      per cent</span> lower than levels recorded a year ago. Both measures suggest that employment is unlikely to grow to any appreciable extent over the remainder of this calendar year. The decline of just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> in the ABS employer-based measure of job vacancies over the year to the three months to May was less than the declines in the newspaper-based vacancies series recorded over the same period. This may reflect an overstatement of the decline in construction vacancies in the newspaper-based measures of vacancies – the DEWRSB vacancy series fell by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">80 per cent</span> over the year to the June quarter, compared with a decline of <span class=\"no-wrap\">23 per cent</span> in the ABS series – as well as the increasing popularity of the Internet as a job-matching medium (notwithstanding the sharp decline in vacancies advertised on the Internet in recent months). ", " In contrast to the indications provided by the various measures of vacancies, the major business expectations surveys point to some improvement in the outlook for the labour market. The latest quarterly NAB survey reported that employment intentions for the September quarter 2001 rose sharply. Further improvements in employment intentions of manufacturers were also reported in the June quarter ACCI-Westpac survey and the Dun and Bradstreet survey of manufacturing, retail and wholesale firms. ", " Australia's exports have held up relatively well in the face of slowing world growth, underpinned by the competitiveness of the exchange rate as well as positive developments in key commodity markets. In contrast, the low level of the dollar and weaker domestic demand have dampened import growth. These factors resulted in the external sector contributing three-quarters of a percentage point to output growth in the March quarter and more than two percentage points to growth over the year. Despite a slight deterioration in the terms of trade, Australia recorded a small trade surplus in the March quarter and the current account deficit declined to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.8 per cent</span> of GDP. This improvement in the trade balance continued into the June quarter, with the trade surplus expanding to $1.8 billion, or 1 per cent of GDP. Assuming the net income deficit remains broadly unchanged, this implies that the current account deficit will decline in the June quarter to a little under 2 per cent of GDP, the lowest level since 1980. Looking ahead, however, the weakening in trading partner growth coupled with stronger growth in domestic demand is likely to see some reversal of these trends (Graph 42). ", " The value of exports rose strongly in the June quarter, to be 15 per cent higher over the year, driven primarily by growth in exports of rural and resource products (Graph 43). Exports of manufactured goods and services, by contrast, have been more subdued. By destination, merchandise export growth to East Asia, Japan and the US has slowed over the past year, following a couple of years of very strong growth (Graph 44). The contraction in exports to non-Japan Asia has been most marked, in response to these countries' falling production levels and lower export sales. The weakness has been driven by lower demand for resource exports, particularly from Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Exports to China, however, remain on an upward trend, as its markets become increasingly open. China's expected entry into the World Trade Organisation at the end of the year is likely to result in further growth in exports to that country. Exports to Europe – particularly of resources – increased very strongly in the June quarter. ", " The value of resource exports rebounded in the June quarter, and has grown very strongly since early 1999. While the increase in the June quarter partly reflects higher bulk commodity contract prices, the value of other resource exports has also increased, probably driven by higher re-exports of gold. Despite the slowdown in trading partner growth, demand for most resource exports remains quite strong, with prices in Australian dollar terms encouraging firms to run down inventories and operate at high levels of capacity. ", " Continuing the trend since mid 1999, the value of rural exports also rose strongly in the June quarter to be sharply higher over the year. High levels of rural production have been supporting continued growth in exports, as have continuing price gains for key meat and grain commodities. Meat exports accounted for much of the increase in the June quarter. Cereal exports also increased sharply in the quarter, following a weather-related fall in the March quarter. Wool exports have been another key source of rural export growth in recent years. In the near term, however, growth in the supply of wool for export may slow a little, given the recent elimination of the official wool stockpile, ten years after the collapse of the wool price support scheme. The strength in farm output combined with continued price gains has been reflected in the positive cash flows experienced by the rural sector during the past couple of years. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics is currently forecasting that rural production, exports and prices will increase further in 2001/02. ", " Softening growth in Australia's trading partners has curtailed the growth of manufactured and services exports following a period of strong growth (Graph 45). The recent slowing in manufactured export growth primarily reflects falls in machinery exports and a levelling out of transport equipment sales. The value of service exports has risen in recent months after softening earlier in the year. This increase occurred despite the recent slowing in short-term overseas arrivals, which are only moderately above levels recorded a year ago. ", " The volume of imports fell sharply in the March quarter, to be well below the level of a year ago. This decrease may have been partly in response to the run-up in inventories that occurred across many sectors in the economy in the second half of last year as domestic demand growth slowed. The recent increases in imported goods prices, on account of the lower exchange rate, are also likely to have been important. In value terms, there was a solid rebound in imports in the June quarter, driven by increased imports of consumption and intermediate goods. Import prices, however, rose strongly in the quarter suggesting that import volumes were broadly flat. ", " Imports of capital goods have fallen particularly sharply over the past year (Graph 46). While most categories of capital goods imports declined, the fall has been particularly large for transport and telecommunications equipment. This occurred during a period in which recorded equipment investment remained roughly constant, perhaps suggesting that firms are sourcing an increasing share of equipment investment from domestic producers in response to the relatively higher prices of imported goods on account of the lower level of the exchange rate. It is also possible, however, that the weakness in capital imports foreshadows a weak period in equipment investment ahead. The volume of consumption imports also fell in the March quarter, driven by weaker demand for transport equipment and household electrical equipment. This too may reflect the impact of the lower exchange rate, as retail sales have grown strongly in the year to date. It may also reflect the desire by some retailers to unwind part of the inventory accumulation that took place in the second half of 2000. ", " The net income deficit widened slightly in the March quarter but remained at around 3 per cent of GDP. An increase in interest payments on net debt, combined with a small fall in exports over the period, resulted in the ratio of net interest payments to exports rising to slightly under 10 per cent. Nevertheless, the ratio remained low by historical standards. ", " Australia's net foreign debt increased in the March quarter to $317 billion, or 48 per cent of GDP (Graph 47), although this was substantially offset by a fall in net equity liabilities. Overall, net foreign liabilities amounted to <span class=\"no-wrap\">57 per cent</span> of GDP. Such divergent movements in net foreign debt and equity liabilities have been typical over the past couple of years. In part this is because foreign equity inflows have moderated while Australians have continued to invest in foreign equity markets, notwithstanding the relatively stronger performance of the Australian stock market. (For further details see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A: Composition of Capital Flows in 2000</a>’.) ", " The RBA commodity price index increased by 4 per cent in foreign currency terms in the three months to July, to be 8 per cent higher than the corresponding period a year earlier (Graph 48). In Australian dollar terms, the index remained around historically high levels, having increased by 40 per cent since mid 1999. Almost all of the growth in the index over the past year has been driven by coal, gas, wheat and iron ore prices (Graph 49). In contrast, the weaker outlook for world growth has resulted in lower base metals prices. ", " Following recent negotiations of bulk commodity contracts, coal and iron ore prices have increased sharply. The weakening in the global outlook does not appear to have affected either contract or spot coal prices, which are being underpinned by continued tightness in supply and the general pick-up in global energy prices since mid 1999. Notwithstanding these recent increases, coal prices remain low compared with the levels of recent decades. ", " Gold prices have also increased in the past three months, although they remain little changed from a year ago. After being broadly flat for the past year and a half, base metals prices have fallen in recent months, driven by continuing downgrades to the outlook for world growth. Supply constraints in several markets, particularly aluminium and lead, however, have meant that prices have remained stronger than would normally be expected given the weakening in global industrial production that has occurred (Graph 50). ", " Rural commodity prices have been little changed in recent months, although they remain well up on the low levels recorded in 1998 and 1999. While meat prices have increased over the past year, the apparent containment of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe has resulted in more stable prices over the past couple of months. Sugar prices have also eased in recent weeks, reflecting concerns that the depreciation of the Brazilian currency against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> may stimulate sales from the world's largest exporter. Both cotton and rice prices have fallen sharply this year in response to above-average production levels. ", " After reaching a peak of US$30 in May, oil prices have declined to around US$27 per barrel. These developments have largely reflected the weakening outlook for global growth. Expectations of strong gasoline demand in the US at a time of low inventories, the temporary cessation of Iraqi crude oil exports and the 1 million barrel per day <span class=\"no-wrap\">(4 per cent)</span> cut in OPEC oil production quotas announced in July, however, have provided some offsetting price support. ", " Improving confidence in Australia's economic outlook in recent months has reflected in market interest rates. Earlier in 2001, sentiment about the economy had been very pessimistic and market yields on both short-term and long-term debt had fallen sharply, particularly after the release of the weak December quarter national accounts data in March. Reflecting the gloomy assessments that followed from these data, markets continued to price-in the prospect of further declines in the cash rate for a time after the April monetary easing. This caused yields on 90-day securities to fall below the cash rate target of 5 per cent, with a low of 4.65 per cent reached in late April <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 51)</span>. In subsequent months, however, despite the poor outlook for the world economy and expectations of further monetary easing in the US, expectations of further domestic easing largely disappeared, as markets reacted to the run of stronger economic data. As of early August, 90-day bill yields remained close to the cash rate target. ", " With the US Fed continuing to ease in response to weak US economic data, and Australian cash rates steady since April, the differential in cash rates between Australia and the US has widened to 125 basis points, the largest gap since 1996. The differential in short-term market yields is somewhat wider, as these incorporate expectations of further easing in the US. For 90-day bills, the differential is currently 140 points. ", " The better economic data in Australia has also seen yields on long-term bonds increase appreciably in recent months. Yields on 10-year bonds had reached a low point of just under 5 per cent in mid March. Since then, Australian bond yields have increased to around 6 per cent, though they dipped sharply following release of the July labour market data (Graph 52). ", " The differential between Australian and US bonds has steadily increased over the past few months, reaching a peak of 100 basis points in late July, the highest levels seen since the time of the Russian debt default in 1998. The main factor driving the widening spread seems to have been greater confidence that Australia's near-term economic prospects are more solid than those in the US. As can be seen in Graph 53, the widening in the bond spread has gone hand-in-hand with a widening in the differential at the short end of the yield curve. In the second half of July, the widening bond differential was exacerbated by ‘safe-haven’ buying of US bonds in response to concerns about emerging markets, sparked by problems in Argentina. ", " Corporate bond yields have also moved up since the trough in market interest rates in March (Graph 54). The increases have, however, been slightly smaller than the increases in government bond yields of similar maturity, implying a small decline in the credit spreads on corporate bonds. This seems to have been due to reduced concerns about credit risks as expectations about domestic economic growth improved. Yields on AAA-rated corporate bonds are currently around 35 basis points higher than for government bonds of similar maturity, compared with a spread of around 50 basis points in the early part of the year. Spreads on other less highly rated corporate paper are also lower than their levels at the beginning of the year. Australian corporate bond spreads remain well below those in the United States. ", " Reductions in the cash rate target between February and April were passed on quickly to intermediaries' variable lending rates and, with the cash rate target unchanged since April, there have been no further changes to the main variable indicator rates in recent months. As a result of the reductions this year, most of these rates have returned to levels near the cyclical lows of three years ago and, given the longer-term compression of banks' interest margins, they are generally well below the earlier cyclical lows recorded in 1994. Table 9 summarises the main indicator rates of financial intermediaries. ", " While most variable rates have not changed recently, there have been significant movements in fixed rates for both homeowners and businesses. Movements in these rates tend to reflect changes to the cost of intermediaries' fixed-rate funding, which has generally been increasing in recent months, after a substantial decline over the year to March. Reflecting the recent increases in funding costs, the average 3-year fixed rate on small business loans has increased by around one percentage point from the trough recorded in March, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.40 per cent</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 55)</span>. This increase was slightly greater than the increase in swap rates of similar maturity, from which these loan products are priced. ", " For housing loans, the increase in fixed rates has been more muted, with banks absorbing some of the increase in funding costs. The average 3-year fixed mortgage interest rate offered by banks has increased by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.4 percentage</span> points since April, following a fall of almost 1.6 percentage points from the most recent peak in early 2000. The average 3-year fixed mortgage rate is currently close to standard variable rates, though the rates for longer maturities are higher. ", " The level of issue activity in the domestic non-government bond market remained high in the June quarter and has been strong in the month of July (Graph 56). Non-government bonds outstanding are estimated at $99 billion at end July, with the asset-backed sector accounting for $32 billion, financial entities $24 billion, corporates <span class=\"no-wrap\">$24 billion</span> and non-residents $19 billion. ", " During the June quarter, non-residents and the asset-backed sector were the largest issuers, though corporate bond issuance increased strongly in the quarter (Table 10). While still accounting for more than a third of issuance, non-residents did not make up as large a share of issuance as in the March quarter. During the March quarter, narrower credit spreads in Australia compared with spreads seen in overseas markets, such as the US, combined with favourable terms on cross-currency basis swaps, made it attractive for foreign borrowers to issue debt in the Australian market. In the June quarter, much of the advantage of issuing in Australia dissipated as credit spreads fell much more sharply in the US than in Australia. ", " The asset-backed sector in Australia, mainly comprising securitised mortgages, has seen continued strong activity in the first half of this year. The value of residential mortgages securitised increased to about $53 billion in June from $43 billion in December (Graph 57). Housing loans securitised rose to 15 per cent of all Australian residential mortgages, up from 13 per cent in December. This increase in activity largely reflects two major banks starting to securitise their home loans for the first time. Most of the mortgage-backed bonds issued in the half year were sold in offshore markets. ", " In the month of July the domestic bond market saw a broader mix of issuers than had been the case in previous months with several corporate and lower-rated entities accessing the market. Property trusts and utilities have accounted for a large share of corporate debt issuance over the past 18 months. Reflecting their inflation-linked revenue, utilities have been substantial issuers of inflation-indexed bonds and have contributed significantly to the strong growth of the indexed-bond market (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a> ). ", " Despite concerns about corporate profitability, the credit quality of the corporate bond market remains high in Australia. There have been no defaults on corporate bond issues. High-profile companies that have failed this year, such as HIH Insurance, Harris Scarfe and One Tel, had no domestic bonds on issue. Graph 58 shows one measure of credit quality, the average credit rating of non-government bonds (excluding asset-backed bonds) outstanding. Despite the strong growth of the market in recent years and the introduction of lower-rated issuers, the average rating of all bonds on issue has only fallen slightly and remains at a relatively high level between AA and AA−. ", " One feature of the Australian corporate bond market over the past 18 months or so is the use of <span class=\"no-wrap\">credit-enhancing</span> facilities (known as ‘credit wrapping’) by utilities and airports when issuing debt. Typically the repayment of these bonds is guaranteed by a highly rated institution. This has led to a rise in the average credit rating of corporate paper on issue. Abstracting from the effect of credit enhancement (by looking at the issuers' ratings rather than the credit-enhanced bonds' ratings) shows how the use of such techniques has allowed a broader range of companies to access finance direct from the market. On this basis, the average credit rating of corporate borrowers with bonds outstanding in the market decreased from AA in 1997 to around A in 2001. This change in average credit rating of borrowers accessing the market is predominantly due to the entry of lower-rated issuers; credit downgrades of corporates account for only a minor part of this trend. ", " Despite some significant earnings downgrades, the Australian share market rose further over May and June. The peak was reached on the last trading day of June though there was some unusual trading that day which ASIC is investigating. Since late June (and abstracting from the end-June peak), the Australian market has retreated a little from its recent highs. Nevertheless, the overall growth in the Australian market since the start of the year contrasts with the performance in the US, where share prices fell (Graph 59). Since the peak in March last year, the Wilshire index in the US has fallen by 26 per cent, while the Australian index has risen by 5 per cent over the same period. This recent stronger performance of the Australian market has offset the underperformance relative to the US over the previous two or three years. ", " Banks' share prices have increased strongly over the past few months, providing the largest contribution to the increase in the overall share market (Graph 60). There does not seem to be any concern about banks' credit exposures, despite some recent high-profile corporate failures. Shares in the resources sector, however, were hurt by concerns about world growth prospects and weaker commodity prices. The share prices of industrial companies other than banks also fell, led by the telecommunications sector. ", " Uncertainty about corporate profitability has had an impact on the Australian share market, though corporate profits here remain much stronger than in the US (Graph 61). Several ‘blue chip’ companies announced that earnings growth would not be as high as previously expected, leading to falls in their share prices. The banking sector – whose earnings have been underpinned by robust credit growth – was relatively unaffected by this uncertainty. Overall, expectations of growth in earnings per share of industrial companies have been revised down more quickly this year than in 1999 and 2000, though the rate of downward revision has slowed in recent months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 62)</span>. Estimates for earnings per share growth in 2002 have strengthened, implying that share analysts are expecting a rebound in earnings per share after a weaker performance in 2001. ", " Australian shares prices appear to have benefited from offshore buying associated with a larger Australian weighting in global share indices. In May, Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) announced revisions to the composition of its share price indices. The changes have been introduced to better reflect the proportion of each market's shares that are freely tradable (for example, by taking account of foreign ownership restrictions and government ownership of partly privatised entities). The transition to the new indices will be made in several stages and will be completed in May 2002. The changes made by MSCI caused Australia's weight in its indices to rise, particularly within the Asia-Pacific region (Table 11). While banks were the main beneficiaries, some sectors – such as telecommunications and media – saw their weightings fall. ", " The amount of funds raised by companies via initial public offerings slowed in recent months. An average <span class=\"no-wrap\">of $116 million</span> per month was raised between May and July, compared to a monthly average of $387 million during 2000. Sizeable floats foreshadowed by several companies for the month of August suggest that the pace of equity raisings through initial public offerings may pick up a little in the near term. Broader measures of equity raisings (including rights issues and placements) have been running at a stronger pace than initial public offerings this year. ", " Margin lending for equities and managed funds continues to increase strongly in terms of value lent, approved credit limits and the number of clients. During the June quarter, total margin debt rose by 16 per cent, after growth of 2 per cent the previous quarter. Over the past year, margin lending has grown more rapidly than other forms of personal finance and now represents 12 per cent of all personal loans (excluding housing). The average leverage ratio (the ratio of loans to shares) is 46 per cent, down a little from the middle of last year (Table 12). After increasing substantially in the March quarter, growth in margin calls slowed in the June quarter and was less than the increase in overall margin debt. ", " Financial conditions continue to be relatively expansionary. As a result of the easing in monetary policy since the beginning of 2001, the level of the cash rate is below its average of recent years and near previous cyclical lows. Borrowing rates are also relatively low and are supporting a robust expansion in credit to households. The yield curve has retained a modest upward slope and the exchange rate remains at a low level in both real and nominal terms. As described in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic                                      Financial Markets</a>’, the Australian equity market is near its historical high. ", " The 1¼ percentage point reduction in the cash rate earlier in the year was quite rapid, as the favourable outlook for inflation provided the scope for monetary policy to move quickly to a more supportive stance for domestic economic activity. The magnitude of the reduction in the cash rate in Australia has been comparable to that in other English-speaking countries, with the exception of the US where it has been considerably larger. The greater extent of the monetary easing in the US reflects the weaker economic outlook there compared with that in Australia. ", " It is difficult to identify the benchmark against which one can assess whether a particular level of interest rates is expansionary. <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a> discusses some of the determinants of the ‘neutral’ rate of interest and indicates that these are likely to have contributed to gradual shifts in the neutral rate over time. One approximate benchmark is the average interest rate over the period since 1992 during which inflation has been low and stable and the economy has recorded good growth on average. Using that as a guide suggests the current level of cash rates is expansionary for economic activity. Graph 63 shows that using a similar benchmark for borrowing rates, current settings are even further below the average rate since 1992, reflecting the reduction in interest rate margins by financial intermediaries over the course of the 1990s. ", " These relatively low levels of real interest rates shown in the graph may, however, be slightly exaggerating the apparent expansiveness of current settings. The real rates are calculated using actual inflation as a proxy for expected inflation but it is likely that the gap between actual and expected inflation has narrowed over the course of the 1990s as the low inflation environment has become better established. This suggests that more accurate measures of average real interest rates since 1992 may be slightly lower than those shown in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 63</span> (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> in the February 2001 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite> for more discussion of the calculation of real interest rates). ", " The increased stability in the inflation environment in recent years complicates the interpretation of the slope of the yield curve, which is the difference between long-term rates determined by the market and short-term rates largely determined by monetary policy settings. A decline in inflation variability is likely to be reflected in lower long-term yields – as bondholders require a smaller premium to compensate them for this uncertainty – implying that the historical difference between short and long-term yields that is associated with normal economic conditions may have narrowed. Over the course of 2001, the slope of the yield curve has shifted from negative to positive as short rates have fallen and long rates have risen (Graph 64). The fall in short-term rates reflects the easing in monetary policy since the beginning of the year, while the rise in long-term yields appears to reflect the fact that expectations of an economic recovery have become more firmly held. ", " Credit grew at an annualised rate of around 10 per cent over the six months to June, which is toward the lower end of the range of growth experienced over much of the past decade (Graph 65). Households continue to borrow at a considerably faster pace than businesses, with household credit rising at an annualised rate of nearly 14 per cent over the six months to June, compared with growth of 6 per cent in business credit over the same period. Household borrowing has been bolstered by a significant pick-up in lending for housing which has increased at an annual rate of 17½ per cent over the three months to June. In contrast, the more subdued pace of business borrowing is consistent with businesses' assessment of current conditions. Data on loan approvals suggest that these trends in household and business borrowing will continue in coming months. ", " Growth in the broader monetary aggregates eased a little in the June quarter, following very strong growth in the March quarter. M3 and broad money have grown at an annualised rate of 15 and 11 per cent respectively in the six months to June. Among funding sources not counted in the monetary aggregates, domestic bond issuance and net offshore borrowing by financial institutions slowed in the June quarter. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International                                      and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar has been broadly unchanged over the past three months, both against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms, but is around <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> lower than a year earlier against the US dollar and 6 per cent lower in trade-weighted terms. The movement in the real exchange rate, which adjusts for differences in inflation rates across countries, has been similar. Graph 66 shows that the real exchange rate has fallen by around 4½ per cent over the year to June to be 14 per cent below its 1990s average and close to historic lows. The low level of the exchange rate is likely to provide continued support to the export and import-competing sectors of the economy. ", " The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter to be 6.0 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 67, Table 13). The rise in the quarter resulted from broadly based inflation across tradable products, with the prices of non-tradable products rising much more moderately. Higher petrol prices as well as the recent tax changes continue to affect inflation in year-ended terms. Over the year to the June quarter, petrol prices contributed a little under ½ a percentage point to inflation, while the direct effects of tax changes are estimated to have contributed a little under 3 percentage points, although the latter estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty. Thus CPI inflation excluding the effects of tax changes and petrol is estimated to be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span> on a year-ended basis. ", " Measures of underlying inflation adjusted for tax are estimated to have been running at a similar annual rate, and also suggest that there has been an increase in the rate of underlying inflation during the first half of 2001. This pick-up seems, in part, to reflect the flow through of accumulated upstream price pressures related to the exchange rate depreciation over the past two years, as well as higher raw materials prices. It may also reflect some more general rebuilding of retailers' margins, given the improvement in economic conditions since the second half of last year. It is possible, however, that the increase could also reflect some delayed pass-through of GST-related price adjustments, although the size and timing of these effects will never be known precisely. ", " While price increases were recorded for many items in the quarter, there were some particularly large movements. Petrol prices rose by 3.2 per cent reflecting both the lower exchange rate and higher Asian-benchmarked oil prices, and beef and lamb prices rose by around 10 per cent due to tight world supply conditions and strong international demand for Australian meat. More recently, petrol prices at the pump have fallen sharply and global beef prices are showing signs of stabilising. Lower petrol prices are likely to subtract significantly from the CPI rise in the September quarter. The price of fruit and vegetables fell by 5.6 per cent in the June quarter, partially unwinding the weather-affected increase in the March quarter. ", " To a large extent, the increase in inflation in the past two quarters has reflected higher prices of tradable goods <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 68)</span>. In import-weighted terms, the Australian dollar has depreciated by around 15 per cent over the past two years, which has contributed to a large rise in the price of imported products (Graph 69). This has imposed higher costs on businesses using imported inputs, with large rises evident in the prices of inputs used in manufacturing industries and some flow-through to manufactured output prices. It has also imposed higher costs on retailers selling imported goods. Despite this, the consumer price of tradable goods rose only moderately over the course of 2000 (abstracting from the effects of the tax changes), probably due to competitive pressures and an expectation that the exchange rate depreciation was to be short lived. ", " During the past two quarters, however, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of tradable items in the CPI that has recorded price increases (Graph 70). This may have reflected some degree of margin rebuilding in response to the sustained lower level of the exchange rate, as well as higher world prices for a number of goods. These factors have affected the retail prices of both imported items, such as motor vehicles, and domestically produced items with prices largely set in world markets, such as beef and lamb. The prices of motor vehicles, parts and accessories have risen particularly strongly over the past two quarters, with the price of imported cars having risen by around 5 per cent, the largest increase since 1994. The prices of a wide range of tradable products, such as books, toys, clothing and household furnishings have also risen, contributing to an increase in the price of tradable goods and services of 1.4 per cent in the June quarter, following a similar rise in the March quarter. ", " By contrast, the prices of non-tradable products have increased more modestly in recent quarters, in part held down by the house purchase component of the CPI. The price of house purchase fell by 0.3 per cent in the June quarter reflecting the additional $7,000 grant to first-home buyers of new dwellings, and lower building materials prices in line with the decline in activity in this sector since the middle of 2000. This has been partly offset by continuing strong increases in the price of insurance. Many other non-tradable components, however, have exhibited little price pressure over the past couple of quarters: the price of domestic travel and accommodation has recorded lower than usual growth, as have some utilities, and the price of communication services has continued to fall. Overall, the moderation in inflation in the non-tradable sector appears to reflect contained wages growth and a moderation in domestically sourced price pressures. ", " Following falls in the March quarter which were driven largely by lower world oil prices and softer world prices for some other products, producer prices rebounded in the June quarter, to grow at around the quarterly rates being recorded since mid 1999 (Graph 71, Table 14). The rise in the June quarter primarily reflected the impact of the lower exchange rate, some increase in oil prices and continued strength in world meat prices. Abstracting from these factors, domestic price pressures more generally appear to have remained modest. The prices of most domestically produced final stage products rose by less than ½ per cent in the June quarter, with many prices either unchanged or falling, indicating an easing in upstream price pressures from those recorded during last year. That said, the higher increases for producer prices overall are suggestive of some continuing pressure on retail margins. ", " Prices at the earlier stages of production have risen by 12 to 14 per cent over the past two years, with the imported components rising by around 25 to 30 per cent. By comparison, final stage prices have risen by a more moderate 9 per cent over the period. In large part this reflects the greater importance for final stage prices of labour costs, overheads and profit margins. ", " On an industry basis, the strength in producer prices in the quarter was concentrated in the manufacturing sector, with more moderate outcomes in the construction and services sectors. The cost of materials used in house building has remained broadly flat over the past year, after rising by more than 5 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year to June 2000</span>, with the overall price of the output of the building industry moving in a similar fashion. In the services sector, continued rapid growth in the price of property services (reflecting buoyant real estate conditions) has been offset by moderate outcomes for the price of transport services. The price of business services recorded a large rise in the June quarter, although this seems to be seasonal and is driven by a rebound in the price of television advertising from low levels recorded in the March quarter. Abstracting from this effect, inflation in the business services component has also been moderate. ", " The major business surveys indicate that inflationary pressures have eased from the vigorous pace experienced in 2000, though they remain stronger than in the period 1996 to 1999 (Graph 72). The economy-wide NAB survey reports that quarterly growth in product prices eased to around 0.4 per cent in the June quarter, although expectations are that it will increase to 0.6 per cent in the September quarter. Surveys of manufacturers, such as that produced by ACCI-Westpac, also report that the proportion of firms who have raised their prices has eased over the past couple of quarters, although some rebound is expected in the September quarter given the continuing increases in production costs. ", " Most indicators suggest that wages growth picked up during the past year and a half, although the increases have been modest compared with previous episodes (Table 15). Growth in the Wage Cost Index (WCI) was <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.7 per cent</span> over the year to the March quarter, up from 3.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter 2000. Most of the pick-up in the March quarter was due to stronger growth in public-sector wages, particularly in the education sector. Growth in the private-sector component of the WCI edged up slightly in the March quarter, to 3.6 per cent on a year-ended basis, continuing an upward trend that is likely to reflect the delayed impact of tighter labour market conditions in mid 2000 (Graph 73). ", " While growth in the national accounts measure of average compensation per employee also increased in the March quarter, this measure exhibits considerable volatility. Excluding lumpy and irregular payments, the pace of wage growth recorded in the national accounts was around 3½ per cent over the year to the March quarter, around the same as that recorded in the middle of last year. Growth in average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE), on the other hand, has eased over recent quarters from earlier high rates, although this probably reflects the effect of compositional change more than underlying developments. ", " The latest data on federal enterprise agreements also suggest that wage pressures remain well contained. The average rate of wage growth provided by new federal enterprise agreements eased in the March quarter, to an average annual rate of 3.7 per cent. New private-sector agreements contained wage increases that were noticeably lower in the March quarter, at 3.6 per cent, down from 4.1 per cent in the previous quarter, partly due to compositional effects: there were some large retail agreements, which in recent years have typically recorded lower than average outcomes, certified in the quarter. In the construction and manufacturing industries, average wage increases in new enterprise agreements eased in the March quarter following the weakening in demand conditions in these sectors in the second half of 2000. The aggregate wage increase implied by the stock of all current federal enterprise agreements has remained steady at 3.7 per cent. ", " Indications are that wages growth may have eased more recently, in line with the weakening in the labour market since mid 2000. The Mercer Cullen Egan Dell (MCED) <em>Salary                                      Review</em> reports that the average wage increase paid to office workers and executives declined slightly in the June quarter, to year-ended rates of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.3 per cent</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.5 per cent</span>, respectively. The business surveys have also suggested that growth in labour costs slowed in the June quarter and businesses expect this trend to continue in the September quarter. Both the NAB survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers report that the difficulty of attracting suitable labour has eased in recent quarters. ", " The inflation expectations of consumers have returned to levels recorded a couple of years ago, after the strong rises associated with the introduction of the GST (Graph 74). The Melbourne Institute indicates that consumers' median expectation for inflation has averaged a little under 4½ per cent over the past few months, down from the peak of over 8 per cent in May 2000. The data have been quite volatile in recent months, behaving in a somewhat similar manner to that recorded in 1998. This reflects the fact that roughly equal proportions of respondents are nominating figures either in the 2 to 3 per cent range or around 5 per cent, and few respondents are nominating a 4 per cent figure, when asked about how much prices will rise over the next year. Small changes in the proportion of respondents in each category can thus cause a relatively large shift in the median inflation expectation. Over the past decade, the median response has consistently exceeded the actual rate of inflation, due to the presence of a number of respondents who continue to expect that inflation over the next year will be 5 or 10 per cent. ", " Most financial-market economists surveyed by the Bank revised up their inflation forecasts with the release of the higher-than-expected June quarter CPI. They now expect inflation to remain within the 2 to 3 per cent band over the next year rather than falling just below 2 per cent as previously anticipated. The median inflation forecast for the year to June 2002 increased from 1.9 per cent in the May survey to 2.3 per cent in the latest survey <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 16)</span>. Most respondents' forecasts still incorporate the assumption that over the next couple of years, the exchange rate will appreciate and the oil price will decline. Trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), have revised down their expectations for inflation over the year to June 2002 in the August survey, partly unwinding the sharp increase reported in the May survey. Nevertheless, union officials generally expect inflation to remain high over the next two years. ", " Businesses expectations for medium-term inflation in the June quarter remained largely unchanged from the March quarter, and are broadly similar to those of around a couple of years ago. The NAB survey indicated that less than one in ten respondents expected inflation to average more than 4 per cent, while one-third of respondents expected inflation to be below 3 per cent. Longer-term inflation expectations of financial market participants, measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, have been broadly unchanged over the past three months at around 2½ per cent. ", " Higher-than-expected inflation outcomes in the past two quarters have followed the lower than expected outcomes in the previous two quarters. The uncertainties in disentangling the effects of the tax changes, coupled with the recent volatility in the inflation data, mean that any judgement about the rate of underlying inflation is subject to considerable uncertainty. It is possible that recent outcomes reflect some lingering effects of the earlier tax changes, but at this stage the more likely cause seems to be some pass-through of the accumulated upstream price pressures of the past couple of years. As such, the Bank's assessment is that the underlying pace of inflation, net of the effects of tax changes and movements in petrol prices, has stepped up from around 1½ per cent a couple of years ago to around 2¾ per cent currently. ", " Higher prices have been concentrated in the tradable sector in the past two quarters, with inflation in the prices of non-tradable goods and services much more quiescent. There have been conspicuous price rises both for items with a high imported content, such as motor vehicles, and for items which, although domestically produced, have prices that are largely set in world markets, such as meat products. The price increases over the first half of the year suggest that businesses have been able to rebuild margins that had been squeezed in the second half of 2000 by the effects of the lower exchange rate and higher input prices, most notably for oil. Despite the recent margin rebuilding, it is likely that the lower exchange rate will contribute to further pressure on retail prices in the period ahead, given the extent of its decline over the past two years, the resulting rise in import prices across the docks and the higher upstream prices as indicated by producers. ", " However, there are a number of factors that should act to counterbalance these pressures. There are signs that the slowing world economy is placing some downward pressure on the prices of some commodities (such as oil and base metals) and manufactured goods (for example, in the information technology and communications area). Domestically, firms may find it difficult to continue to raise prices significantly while there remains appreciable spare capacity in the economy (although the recent corporate exits in the insurance, telecommunications and airline industries may take the edge off the intense competitive pressures that have been present in these industries in recent years). Wages growth is unlikely to rise further in the near term in light of current and prospective conditions in the labour market. ", " On balance, the Bank's expectation is that, net of taxes and petrol prices, underlying inflation will remain around the top of the 2 to 3 per cent medium-term target band for the rest of 2001, before easing gradually in 2002 as the upstream pressures wane leaving the more moderate domestic price and wage pressures as the main influence on inflation. CPI inflation is likely to be a little lower than this, largely reflecting the recent decline in petrol prices from earlier peaks. This assessment is based on the usual technical assumptions that the exchange rate remains around recent levels and that the oil price remains around <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$27 per barrel</span> (West Texas Intermediate). ", " While this is judged to be the most likely scenario, risks in both directions can be identified. On the one hand, inflation could be higher than forecast if domestic cost pressures accelerated, rather than remaining contained. The likelihood of this outcome would increase were aggregate demand to grow more quickly than expected at a time when inflation was already relatively high. In the other direction, if global economic conditions continued to weaken, and this affected Australia's aggregate demand significantly, prices for both tradable and non-tradable products would be expected, in due course, to moderate. In this scenario, inflation during 2002 could (on standard assumptions) be lower than forecast above. At the present time, the Bank judges these risks to be about evenly balanced. ", "a sharp fall during the March quarter as sentiment about domestic economic activity deteriorated rapidly, particularly after the release of the unexpectedly weak national accounts figures <span class=\"no-wrap\">for the December quarter;</span> ", "a partial recovery over April and May as domestic economic data turned stronger; and", "a relatively stable period since. While most domestic economic data have continued to improve during this latest period, deepening concern in world markets about the global outlook, and an associated weakening in commodity prices, have served to limit the recovery in the Australian dollar. The current exchange rate is 8 per cent above the early April low of US47.75 cents.", " net equity flows fell away sharply during 2000 after being quite strong through 1998 and 1999; ", " bond flows have been negative since 1997. This is the period when bond yield differentials relative to the US narrowed very sharply; and ", " inflows through banks and the money market have increased strongly. These flows incorporate overseas borrowings by banks, which are on-lent to Australian households and businesses, as well as purchases of Australian corporate short-term debt by foreigners. It is important to note that the foreign borrowings by banks are either directly in Australian dollars or hedged back to Australian dollars. Banks use foreign borrowings as a way of diversifying their funding base, not to take on currency risk. ", " This Box summarises recent data on capital flows into and out of Australia. ", " Capital flows can be disaggregated in various ways. Graph A1 breaks the flows down into three main types: equity flows; bond flows (mainly government bonds); and flows channelled through the banking system and money market. For each category the flows are shown in net terms – i.e. the difference between inflows and outflows. The data are also smoothed to some extent by showing four quarter moving totals. ", " The main points that can be observed from the graph are as follows: ", " Equity flows can be disaggregated further, into direct investment (i.e. investment in Australian companies by overseas companies) and portfolio investment (essentially investment through share markets by funds managers and other institutions). This disaggregation is shown in Graph A2, and highlights that the decline of equity inflows into Australia last year was almost entirely due to swings in portfolio equity. Net direct investment has remained strong – i.e. overseas companies are continuing to find attractive investment opportunities in Australia. ", " Net portfolio equity flows can, in turn, be disaggregated further, into investment by foreigners into Australian shares and investment by Australians into foreign shares (Graph A3). This shows that the net outflows of portfolio equity investment in 2000 occurred because foreigners stopped investing into Australian shares (and in fact reduced their holdings of shares) while Australians increased their purchases of foreign shares. ", " These changes in the composition of capital flows have been reflected in the outstanding claims that foreigners have on Australia. As a proportion of GDP, net foreign liabilities have not changed much over recent years, at around 55 per cent, but there has been a shift away from equity to debt over the past couple of years (Graph A4). ", " The currency composition of Australia's foreign assets and liabilities can be seen in Graph A5. It shows that Australia's net foreign liabilities are not reflected in a foreign currency exposure. Australia has more <span class=\"no-wrap\">foreign-currency</span> assets than liabilities, as most liabilities to foreigners are in Australian dollars. ", " Over the past decade, there has been a divergence in population growth among the Australian states. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Table B1</span> shows the sources of population growth in each of the states over the past decade. Over this period, the bulk of population growth in most states has been attributable to natural population increase. Overseas migration has tended to be an important source of population increase in NSW and Victoria – since these states are the main points of entry for migrants – and in Western Australia. ", " Interstate migration has been a significant driver of differences in population growth between the states. Since 1990, Queensland and, to a lesser extent, Western Australia have consistently recorded net inflows of residents from other states, contributing to above-average rates of population growth. NSW and Victoria have traditionally recorded a net outflow of residents to other states, which may partly reflect overseas immigrants who ultimately relocate in other states. In contrast, the net outflow of residents from <span class=\"no-wrap\">South Australia and Tasmania</span> has been associated with lower levels of population growth. ", " This pattern has been broadly stable over the past decade, though there have been some noteworthy developments in the past few years (Graph B1). For much of the decade Victoria experienced a net outflow of interstate migrants, with a particularly large and protracted outflow occurring following the early-1990s recession. Since 1998, however, Victoria has been a net recipient of residents from interstate. This is the first time in nearly fifty years that such an inflow has occurred. Furthermore, in Queensland in the past few years, interstate migration has been making its smallest contribution to population growth for more than a decade. ", " While many non-economic factors influence migration flows, economic conditions are an important consideration in the decision to relocate. Consequently, differences in rates of interstate migration can be associated with differences in actual or expected economic conditions between states. In the current environment, net inflows of residents to Victoria are consistent with relatively favourable labour market conditions in that state and greater underlying strength in housing activity. ", " Uncertainty about inflation represents a risk for anyone contracting to receive or pay a fixed nominal amount of money at some date in the future. In pursuing the goal of medium-term price stability, the Reserve Bank has adopted the objective of keeping inflation between 2 and 3 per cent, on average, over the cycle. This helps to narrow the range of likely future inflation rates and to provide reasonable certainty about the price level over the sorts of horizons relevant for most wage and price-setting decisions. But even when average inflation remains low, small variations in the rate of inflation can have a significant effect over the longer <span class=\"no-wrap\">term – for</span> example, on a 20-year bond. The two principal financial market instruments that allow companies to manage their exposure to movements in inflation are inflation-indexed bonds and inflation swaps. ", " Most conventional (‘nominal’) bonds promise the holder a fixed dollar flow of payments over the life of the bond. The price of conventional bonds declines when inflation rises as inflation erodes the real value of their nominal coupon and principal payments. In the case of inflation-indexed bonds, however, the bond's payments are indexed to movements in a price index, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), ensuring the value of interest payments and the bond's principal amount are fixed in real terms. ", " The indexed bond market is small relative to the overall bond market (indexed bonds make up 6 per cent of all bonds outstanding). Nevertheless, in recent years the inflation-indexed bond market has grown steadily, with the market increasing in size by almost 30 per cent over the past five years. As at end June 2001 total outstandings amounted to just under $12 billion (Graph C1). The development of an indexed securities market in Australia dates from 1985 when the Commonwealth issued $100 million of capital-indexed bonds. Subsequently State governments and non-government borrowers have also issued indexed bonds. At present, the Commonwealth government accounts for 50 per cent of indexed bonds, the states a further 21 per cent and non-government issuers 29 per cent. ", " In recent years, much of the corporate issuance of indexed bonds has come from utility companies, whose revenues are linked to the inflation rate. Under the regime administered by the Victorian Office of the Regulator General, for example, the distribution prices charged by electricity generators in Victoria are capped, and the cap is indexed to the CPI. As a result, when such utilities issue nominal bonds, movements in inflation impact on their profits by affecting the margin between their revenues (which are indexed to inflation) and their debt-servicing costs (which do not move in line with inflation). As well as electricity distributors, a number of infrastructure projects, such as the Loy Yang Power stations and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, have borrowed by using inflation-indexed bonds to manage their exposure to fluctuations in inflation. ", " As an alternative to inflation-indexed bonds, companies whose revenues are linked to inflation can issue nominal bonds and hedge the resulting exposure to inflation by using inflation swaps. An inflation swap takes the form of an exchange of a regular stream of inflation-indexed payments for a stream of nominal interest payments. The nominal payments may be based on either a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate such as the bank bill rate. This set of transactions is illustrated in Graph C2. Combining the swap with the nominal bond results is the same net cash flows as if the utility company had issued indexed bonds. ", " The inflation swap market emerged in Australia in the mid 1990s. Like the indexed bond market, the inflation swap market is small in comparison to the overall market for interest-rate swaps. The size of the Australian market for inflation swaps is estimated to be around $500 million nominal principal outstanding, compared with around $500 billion in the nominal swaps market. Unlike the nominal swaps market, where only around 2 per cent of swaps have a maturity of ten years or longer, more than half the inflation swaps outstanding in the Australian market have a maturity of ten years or more. ", " In terms of those looking to enter into swaps that pay an inflation-indexed rate and receive a nominal interest rate, the chief users include utilities, retailers locked into inflation-linked lease payments for their premises, and property trusts. ", " On the other side of the market (i.e. those who wish to pay a nominal rate in return for inflation-linked receipts), firms with inflation-linked liabilities can use inflation swaps to protect themselves against the risk that inflation, and thus their liability, is more than they expected. For example, inflation swaps can provide an offset to the inflation exposure resulting from insurance and life assurance companies' holdings of <span class=\"no-wrap\">inflation-linked</span> liabilities such as indexed annuities. State government borrowing authorities have also used inflation swaps to modify their exposure to inflation that results from mismatches between their <span class=\"no-wrap\">inflation-indexed</span> investments and borrowings. ", " The principal hedge available to financial institutions that act as intermediaries between the various end users of inflation swaps is indexed bonds. As a result, activity in the inflation swaps market is highly dependent on the size and liquidity of the inflation-indexed bond market. ", " The level of real interest rates is one indicator of the stance of monetary policy. Monetary policy may be regarded as expansionary when the real policy rate is below some ‘neutral’ level, which is one consistent with stable inflation and output growing at its potential rate. This box discusses the concept of the ‘neutral’ rate, and describes some of the factors that may cause it to vary over time. While historical experience can provide some guidance, the effect of these influences is difficult to pin down. Consequently, the value of the neutral real interest rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. ", " The idea of a neutral interest rate has its underpinning in the ‘natural’ rate of interest explained by the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell at the end of the 19th century. For Wicksell, the natural rate was that real rate of return on physical capital at which the supply of saving and the demand for investment funds were equal. Wicksell distinguished between this natural rate and the so-called ‘money’ rate of interest which was able to be influenced by monetary policy. When the money rate was below the natural rate, there would be a tendency for credit and investment to undergo a cumulative expansion, so boosting the economy and prices. The reverse would occur when the money rate was higher than the natural rate. When the money rate and the natural rate were the same, monetary policy would be exerting neither an expansionary nor contractionary force on the economy. ", " While Wicksell's model was highly simplified, there is a strong similarity between these basic ideas and those common in modern discussion of monetary policy. The central bank influences interest rates in the short-term money market, but it is the relationship between these financial market rates <span class=\"no-wrap\">and the (unobservable)</span> expected returns on other assets which drives the processes which affect the economy, with the credit process playing an accommodating role. When the setting of money market interest rates is such as to exert neither contractionary nor expansionary forces on the economy, policy can be said to be ‘neutral’. ", " On average, the natural rate can be thought of as anchored by the economy's long-run fundamentals, such as productivity performance, saving and so on. Common usage of the term ‘neutral’ tends to assume that the neutral rate is constant, but the factors that affect the supply of saving and the rate of investment will drive movements in the neutral rate through time, although these are likely to be very gradual. Given that Australia's financial markets are highly integrated with global markets, global developments in saving and investment will also influence the neutral real rate in Australia. ", " The increased rate of productivity growth enjoyed in the United States and Australia over the 1990s is likely to have put upward pressure on the neutral rate in both countries.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> A sustained increase in the rate of productivity growth raises the rate of return to investment. The consequent rise in investment requires a rise in the neutral rate to bring saving and investment back into balance. ", " The size of government deficits can influence the neutral rate by increasing or decreasing the public sector's call on the supply of funds. The increase in budget deficits in many countries through the 1970s and 1980s is likely to have placed upward pressure on the neutral rate. Conversely, the fiscal consolidation around the world over the 1990s (with the exception of Japan) is likely to have put downward pressure on the neutral rate. ", " Demographic factors affect both the supply and demand for funds. Early in their working lives, households tend to save relatively little, but this increases as they approach retirement age. The ‘baby boomers’ are now reaching the peak saving age, which might be expected to be placing downward pressure on the neutral rate, although there is little evidence at this stage that the measured saving rate is increasing due to this factor. On the demand side, an increase in the rate of growth of the labour force will lead to a rise in the neutral rate, as there is a need for more investment to provide the necessary capital to employ the larger labour force. ", " When the rate of inflation is highly variable, suppliers of funds (savers) require a premium to be paid to compensate them for the uncertainty about future inflation, which threatens the erosion of their savings. The increased stability in the rate of inflation over the past decade is likely to have contributed to a lower neutral rate in Australia. ", " Changes in these determinants of the neutral rate over time imply that it is difficult to pin down the level of the neutral rate at any point in time. Two other issues further complicate the determination of the neutral setting of the real policy interest rate. Firstly, the compression of lending margins over the past decade means that a given level of the policy interest rate is now associated with a lower cost of borrowing than in the past and hence provides a greater incentive to invest. This suggests that the neutral policy rate may be higher than in the past. Secondly, the above discussion has been in terms of the neutral <em>real</em> interest rate, but the policy rate is set in nominal terms. As inflation expectations change, the nominal policy rate setting that corresponds to the neutral real rate will also change. Over the past decade, most measures of inflation expectations have declined which suggests that the neutral <em>nominal</em> policy rate is likely to be lower than it was in the past.

The United States has all the hallmarks of recession – declining output, sharply declining profits and investment, falling business and consumer confidence and rising unemployment. These trends were already in train prior to the events of 11 September, as the data up to August make clear, and have continued thereafter. The terrorist attacks themselves were always likely to have only a relatively small economic impact directly, but their effects on confidence – and therefore on the willingness of businesses and individuals to accept risk – are potentially substantial. Gauging these effects is of course a subjective process, and distinguishing them from what was likely to have occurred anyway is virtually impossible. But what is clear is that, for a range of reasons, perceptions of the short-term prospects for the US economy have deteriorated markedly in the past few months. ", " At any time, this would be a matter of significance for the world economy. The fact that it is occurring while other key regions are also experiencing weakness is all the more cause for concern. Japan remains in the grip of powerful deflationary forces, a decade after the bursting of the bubble that had taken prices for shares and land to extreme levels. Many countries in east Asia, and particularly those which had been able to take advantage of the global technology boom of the late 1990s, are now suffering the after-effects of the slump in that sector. In Europe, growth has also weakened noticeably. ", " Hence it is now clear that global growth in 2001 has turned out to be a good deal weaker than previously thought, running at less than half the pace recorded in 2000, and many observers now expect 2002 to be almost as weak. Even the latter forecast depends on the US economy beginning a recovery during the first half of next year. The weakening of international economic activity is exerting downward pressure on prices for internationally traded goods and services. Many commodity prices have fallen sharply, the price of oil prominently among them. But also notable is the continued downward pressure on prices for many manufactured goods, especially, but not only, high-technology goods. Exports from the major countries, for example, are receiving lower prices than a <span class=\"no-wrap\">year ago</span>, and the degree of price decline is larger for the east Asian producers of electronic components. These influences can be expected to exert a dampening effect on CPI inflation in most advanced countries over time. ", " Substantial adjustments have taken place in financial markets over the past year or more. Share prices in many countries are 30–40 per cent below their early 2000 peaks. Bond yields have fallen, and monetary policies have been eased. Short-term interest rates, particularly in the English-speaking countries, are at the lowest levels for <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 years</span>. The events of 11 September imparted an additional element of uncertainty to markets, though the short-term impact had largely passed by late September. Yet, with consensus forecasts for world growth continuing to be revised down and great uncertainty remaining about the economic outlook, a difficult period for markets may still lie ahead. For their part, markets expect that central banks in major countries will need to ease monetary policy further in the months ahead. ", " The most pronounced policy changes have been in the US. The Federal Reserve has reduced short-term interest rates by 450 basis points since the beginning of the year. The US government is also giving a substantial boost via fiscal policy. Much depends on the effectiveness of the US measures, if only because the scope for policy action in other regions seems, for one reason or another, to be limited. In Japan, fiscal and monetary measures over an extended period have all but exhausted the scope for conventional macroeconomic policies – but have not been able to revive chronically weak economic activity, to prevent prices falling or to revitalise weak financial institutions. Underlying structural rigidities in Europe, and the difficulties of building credibility for a new currency, have limited room for expansionary monetary policy measures to date. These constraints should ease as inflation pressures subside, but agreed limits on fiscal balances are likely to become more binding as economies slow. ", " Were it not for such a gloomy prognosis for the world scene, prospects for the Australian economy would be for very strong growth in the coming year. Real GDP expanded at an annualised rate of just over 3 per cent through the first half of 2001, and this before the upswing in housing construction had really begun. Over the coming few quarters, as dwelling construction rises, a significant boost to production can be expected. The decline in non-residential construction which has taken place over the past two years, also appears to be drawing to an end. With even moderate growth in consumer spending, these trends suggest a distinct firming in domestic demand. But at the same time, the externally oriented sector of the economy – where the rise in the trade balance added nearly 4 per cent to national income over the past two years – will find the going much tougher over the next year. Hence it remains the case, as at the time of the last <em>Statement</em>, that the downside risks to Australia's growth performance come mainly from abroad. ", " Surveys of business conditions reflect the strengthening trend in domestic demand, particularly in construction and sectors which supply it. At the same time, indicators of confidence about future conditions have shown a noticeable deterioration in readings taken after the terrorist attacks on the US. Such indexes can give misleading signals – they foreshadowed a sharp economic slowdown in 1998, for example, which did not eventuate – and they may be unreliable when surveying early responses to non-economic events, which could not hope to be more than impressionistic. Nonetheless, it would be understandable if an air of caution prevailed as far as financial, investment and hiring decisions were concerned, at least for a short time. When taken together with indications of pressure on profitability, and softness in business credit, this suggests that a significant expansion in business investment which might otherwise be due may not materialise just yet. An additional factor is the impact of both a decline in international air travel and the demise of Ansett on the tourism industry. In the medium term, the effects of these factors will be ameliorated, and possibly offset, by changes in travel patterns and the supply of additional domestic airline capacity. In the short term, however, there is a quantitatively significant impact on tourism activity. ", " The extent to which business caution may affect the labour market is unclear. Employment has grown during 2001, following a period in which it declined in the second half of last year, but the growth has not been strong enough to prevent a rise in unemployment. Construction and related parts of manufacturing are now seeing stronger demand, but at the same time several services areas, which had been strong for some years, now are reducing their demand for staff. ", " Labour market outcomes will be an important factor affecting household consumption spending, through both income and confidence effects. To date, modest gains in employment and real wages, together with income tax reductions, have assisted growth in consumption. At the present time, this trend appears to be continuing. Household spending should also be supported by household wealth, which has continued to increase and is at an unusually high level relative to current incomes. ", " For the past year, assessing inflation has been complicated by the price level rise associated with the introduction of the GST in July 2000, the size of which was estimated to be of the order of 2½ to 3 per cent. With the September quarter 2001 CPI figures, it is now possible to gauge the trend in prices over a one-year period which is largely free of these effects. Over the four quarters to the September quarter, the CPI rose by 2.5 per cent. This compares with 3.2 per cent for the year to June 2000, immediately prior to the GST's introduction. The recent decline in petrol prices is the principal factor behind the decline in CPI inflation between these two observations. In underlying terms, inflation was closer to 3 per cent over the latest twelve months, up slightly from 2½ per cent in the first half of 2000. ", " So it is now increasingly clear that the economy has weathered the substantial price shocks which occurred <span class=\"no-wrap\">last year – the</span> GST, a substantial rise in wholesale import prices due to the decline in the exchange rate, and the rise in oil prices (since partly reversed) – without a significant deterioration in ongoing inflation performance relative to the target of 2–3 per cent. Inflation expectations, after an initial spike associated with the GST, have declined again, wage claims have remained moderate, and competition in most product markets remains keen, notwithstanding the demise of some firms which had cut prices most aggressively in some areas. ", " At current levels of the exchange rate there should, all other things equal, still be some upward pressure on prices for traded goods and services in the next quarter or two. This factor, together with the impacts of higher insurance premia, rises in air fares and increased electricity charges in some areas, suggests that annual rates of underlying inflation slightly above 3 per cent could still be observed in the near term, as profit margins are gradually restored. These forces have a finite life, however, and given the apparent continued moderate increase in labour costs, the pace of price increases can still be expected to lessen somewhat in due course, as the price level for tradables measured in Australian dollars reaches its new, higher long-term level and other one-off factors fade. International developments, moreover, are placing downward pressure on the foreign currency prices for tradables in international markets. This in turn means that profit margins for importers might be restored without as large a rise in the price to Australian consumers as would otherwise have been the case. ", " The relatively good performance, by international standards, of the domestic economy has been reflected in financial markets. Australian share prices remain only a little below their peak, in contrast to the falls of 30 per cent or more in many other countries. While domestic interest rates have fallen to historical lows, they have not fallen as much as in some other countries. As such, interest differentials have moved in the Australian dollar's favour. This and the share market's resilience have in general supported the exchange rate. On the other hand, with the international trading environment deteriorating, there have been periods of weakness in the exchange rate, particularly after the terrorist attacks in the US. The Bank thought it important to provide a stabilising influence in these circumstances, and undertook foreign exchange intervention to support the exchange rate in the month of September. ", " At its meeting on 4 September, the Board judged that the risks to the world economy and signs that inflation would soon peak made it appropriate to ease monetary policy further, notwithstanding the possibility that <span class=\"no-wrap\">above-target</span> inflation might be observed temporarily in the near term. The cash rate was reduced by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span>. ", " The immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks on 11 September proved a testing time for financial markets. In common with central banks in other major countries, the Reserve Bank sought to ensure, through its daily operations, that uncertainty and heightened risk aversion did not lead to settlement problems or systemic failures in the Australian market. The Bank did not, however, see a case to depart from its normal timetable for considering monetary policy as a result of these developments. The key priority immediately following <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 September</span> was to ensure that the financial system remained functional. Apart from that, the direct short-term impact on the Australian economy of the events themselves was not likely to be large, and a considered response to any likely longer-term impacts was always advisable. Hence the Board met at its normal time on 2 October and, assessing all the available evidence about global events both pre and post the attacks, decided on a further reduction in rates, bringing the cash rate to 4.5 per cent. By any conventional measure, this represents an expansionary setting of monetary policy, a conclusion which can only be reinforced by the low level of the effective exchange rate. To be sure, Australian interest rates are now noticeably above those in the US. But that reflects the contrast between the particular circumstances of the US economy, to which the US authorities have needed to respond, and the relatively stronger performance of the Australian economy since the start of the year. It was with these factors in mind that, at its 6 November meeting, the Board elected not to change the stance of policy for the present. ", " The period ahead is shaping up as a particularly testing time for the global economy and Australia cannot hope to be unaffected by these events. But Australia can reasonably hope to fare better than most other economies in the current episode. Because exposure to the production side of the ‘new economy’ was limited, a major contractionary force at work in the US and Asia is not affecting Australia to the same extent. In fact, as an importer of high-tech manufactured goods, Australia's terms of trade, and hence national income, are improved by the decline in prices of a wide range of such goods. The Australian share market had not been subject to the excesses seen in some overseas countries in earlier years, and it is therefore not facing the same correction now. While profits have declined somewhat, company balance sheets are in good shape and the financial system is sound. Macroeconomic policies are exerting an expansionary influence on output, and have scope to do so because inflation is well controlled and public debt is low. These are the benefits afforded by consistently disciplined policies in the past decade or more. ", " As always, the Bank continues to assess the available information and will adjust as necessary the stance of policy in pursuit of sustainable growth, consistent with the inflation target. ", " Global economic conditions have deteriorated through the year, with growth slowing in all major regions (Table 1). While the main catalyst for the slowdown came initially from the information technology and communications (ITC) sector, which had underpinned growth in many countries in previous years, it became more broad-based as the year progressed, with weaker production and investment outcomes spreading across the industrial sectors of many countries. More recently, and even prior to the terrorist attacks in the United States, consumer spending also began to slow, partly reflecting softer labour market conditions. Unemployment rates have stopped falling in most of Europe and are rising in North America and most countries in Asia. While the slowing in output growth has been synchronised, unlike the recession of the early 1990s, the policy response in a number of countries has been relatively rapid. ", " An easing of inflationary concerns in most countries has enabled monetary policy to be more accommodative, with the global slowdown putting downward pressure on prices due to increases in spare capacity. Wages growth in most countries remains contained. The recent fall in oil prices, if maintained, is also likely to put downward pressure on inflation, though the possible effect of military action places more than the usual degree of uncertainty around this. ", " The US economy contracted for the first time since March 1993 in the September quarter (Graph 1). The fall reflected a decline in business investment, which fell for a third consecutive quarter and is nearly 7 per cent lower than a year earlier (Table 2). Investment in ITC equipment has been particularly weak over much of the past year, following a significant run-up through the 1990s. Private consumption, which has underpinned growth, increased only modestly in the September quarter despite the boost to household income from the tax rebates received in the middle of the year. A rundown in inventories subtracted slightly from growth in the quarter, but has subtracted over a percentage point from growth over the past year. ", " Manufacturing production fell by 1.7 per cent in the September quarter to be more than 5 per cent lower than the peak recorded a year earlier (Graph 2). Business confidence in the manufacturing sector, as measured by the NAPM index, showed some signs of recovery in the September quarter but fell sharply in October to levels last recorded in the early 1990s recession. Profits of non-financial corporations have declined sharply over the past year, with profits as a share of GDP falling back to around levels of the early 1990s. With firms facing intense competition in a slowing market, investment plans are being curtailed and the number of layoff announcements has increased. ", " Employment has continued to fall over the second half of 2001, with the unemployment rate rising by nearly one percentage point over this period. The declines in employment were broad-based: falls were recorded in the wholesale trade, services and retail sectors, whereas previously the fall in employment had been concentrated in the manufacturing industry. Measures of consumer sentiment deteriorated from the middle of the year, with particularly large falls recorded in September. These factors, together with a fall in equity prices, have worked to offset the positive effect of increases in disposable income associated with the income tax reductions in the middle of the year and the increase in mortgage refinancings associated with lower long-term interest rates. In contrast to previous slowdowns, the housing sector remains reasonably buoyant as mortgage interest rates were already relatively low preceding the slowdown. ", " While it is difficult to quantify the impact of the terrorist attacks on the US economy, they had an immediate effect on both consumer and business confidence. At this stage, it is not clear to what extent the falls in business and consumer confidence will translate into falls in aggregate demand, though the speedy policy responses will be helpful. Immediate effects were also felt in a number of sectors where supply was either severely disrupted directly (such as airlines and business and financial services) or indirectly (such as retail and manufacturing). Higher frequency data, such as initial jobless claims and weekly readings of consumer confidence and retail sales, suggest that activity has recovered somewhat, though it is still below levels recorded prior to the attacks. ", " Underlying inflation has remained stable with higher medical costs being offset by falls in the price of electronic goods and motor vehicles (Graph 3). Wage outcomes are drifting lower, though this has been offset to some extent by an increase in benefits being paid. However, the outlook is for a decline in inflation due to increases in spare capacity of both the labour and capital markets, downward pressure on world prices and falls in the price of oil. ", " As signs of the slowdown have emerged, the US Federal Reserve has eased monetary policy much faster than in the early 1990s recession with the Fed funds rate now at its lowest level in almost 40 years. The Fed funds rate was cut by 50 basis points shortly after the attacks in an effort to reduce the likely negative effect on business and household confidence of the terrorist attacks, and by a further 100 basis points in subsequent months, bringing the cumulative easing over the course of the year to 450 basis points. Using the underlying measure of the CPI, the real Fed funds rate is below zero, a level previously reached in the recessions of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 1980s and 1990s</span>. ", " Fiscal policy has also become supportive of growth due both to policy initiatives and to the operation of the automatic stabilisers (Graph 4). The fiscal package announced mid year amounted to about 1 per cent of GDP spread over two years. Since then Congress has approved emergency relief and airline industry assistance totalling US$55 billion (around ½ a per cent of GDP) spread over the next two years and is considering a further <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$100 billion</span> package (equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP). ", " The slowdown in the US has had a significant impact on its two closest neighbours, Mexico and Canada. Growth in Canada has tracked that of the US fairly closely, with year-ended growth in output falling from 5 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">March 2000</span> to just above 2 per cent in June 2001. Much of the fall in growth is due to a decline in manufacturing production, with the slowdown in the US likely to cause further weakness in the transport and auto industries. Monetary and fiscal policies have both been eased, but not to the same extent as in the US. Mexico experienced its third consecutive decline in output in the June quarter, driven by falling investment and weaker exports. As in Canada, the export-related industries (especially tourism and oil) are likely to face lower revenues in the next few quarters. ", " The other Latin American countries are also experiencing weakness. Annual growth in output in Brazil has fallen from a peak of around 6 per cent in the middle of 2000, to around 1 per cent. The recent weakness reflects softer external demand, though energy-rationing measures also reduced output in the June quarter. Argentina's economy continues to contract, with year-ended growth in output falling for the fourth consecutive quarter in June (for details on Argentinian financial markets see ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’). ", " The Japanese economy has deteriorated further with the national accounts showing a decline in output in the June quarter. Real GDP has shown little growth over the past four and a half years (Graph 5). Moderate growth in private consumption in the quarter was more than offset by falls in private investment, driven largely by the slowdown in global demand for ITC goods. ", " Indications are that the Japanese economy contracted further in the second half of the year. Weakness in the ITC sector, which accounts for about 14 per cent of industrial production, has persisted, with manufacturing output in that sector almost 30 per cent below late-2000 levels and export volumes down by a similar amount over the same period (Graph 6). However, weakness in the manufacturing sector has become more broad-based, with non-ITC output down to levels below those seen during the Asian crisis. Business sentiment, as measured by the Tankan survey, declined further in the September quarter, in response to deteriorating economic conditions and the potential fallout from the terrorist attacks in the US, though the index is still above the levels recorded in the Asian crisis and the early 1990s recession. The survey also pointed to subdued capital expenditure plans. ", " The prospects for consumer spending have worsened. Employment has declined by around 1½ per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">since late 2000</span> with the unemployment rate reaching an historic high of 5.3 per cent in September; job offers are also trending downwards. Consumer prices continue to fall, with the core measure of inflation around ¾ of a percentage point lower in September 2001 compared with a year ago. ", " The Bank of Japan has responded to the deteriorating economic circumstances by implementing measures to boost the level of settlement funds held by the banking system as there is no scope for official interest rates to be reduced further. The government has announced the outline of a fiscal package which includes employment support measures and assistance for small business. A self-imposed limit on bond issuance by the government has limited the size of the package. Senior Bank of Japan and government officials have suggested that asset sales may be used to fund any further increases in expenditure. In any case, the spending is likely to be more modest than previous supplementary budgets and will therefore do little more than maintain the support for activity currently in place. ", " Much of the region's exports have been affected significantly by the downturn in global growth and demand for ITC goods. Exports of the four major ITC producers – Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia – were around <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span> lower in September than their peak in 2000 (Graph 7). The sharp decline in exports over the past year has, in turn, dampened production and investment, although production appeared to be stabilising in the middle of the year, with solid increases in July and August. In contrast, consumer spending, which had underpinned growth in most countries over the first half of the year appears to be moderating, especially in those countries experiencing rising unemployment (Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand). Korea has fared relatively better, due to ongoing strength in domestic demand. ", " The slowdown in growth experienced in non-Japan Asia towards the end of last year became more pronounced in the first half of 2001. GDP in the region (excluding China) contracted by ½ per cent in the June quarter – the first decline since the 1998 crisis – following two quarters in which it had not grown. The weakness in growth has been most pronounced in those countries heavily involved in the ITC sector. China remains the only economy in the region to be growing at a robust pace, largely reflecting the relatively small size of its external sector, the more diversified nature of its exports and expansionary fiscal policies. ", " In response to the deteriorating outlook, monetary authorities in much of the region have eased policy. Official interest rates have been reduced significantly in Taiwan, while Korea has eased quite quickly as inflation has moderated. In the Philippines, the sharp rise in interest rates last year in response to rising inflation has largely been unwound. Hong Kong has reduced rates in line with falls in US official interest rates, and Malaysia reduced rates in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States (Table 3). ", " Several countries have also announced fiscal packages aimed at boosting domestic demand. In Singapore, the government has announced two packages totalling 8.4 per cent of GDP, which is slightly larger than the stimulus implemented during the Asian crisis. The Hong Kong, Malaysian and Korean governments have also announced stimulus packages that are more modest in size than in Singapore. The Hong Kong package includes measures to assist residential property owners with negative equity in their property due to the significant fall in residential property prices in recent years. In Taiwan, stimulus measures were announced earlier in the year, but delays in legislative approval have meant that the impact is more likely to be felt from the second half of this year. ", " The New Zealand economy grew by 2 per cent in the June quarter, following a period of slow growth over the preceding year. Private investment rebounded in line with firming business confidence, while consumer spending rose strongly reflecting buoyant labour market conditions and rising rural incomes. Net exports continued to make a strong contribution to growth, with a low exchange rate offering some protection against the slowdown in world growth. Inflation declined to 2.4 per cent in the September quarter, having been around the top end of the RBNZ's target range for the past year due to rising world oil prices, an increase in taxes on tobacco and the depreciation of the exchange rate. The RBNZ reduced the official cash rate by 50 basis points in September, bringing the cumulative easing since March 2001 to 125 basis points. ", " Annual growth across the Euro area weakened to around 1¾ per cent in the middle of the year, from its peak of just under 4 per cent a year earlier, though the outcome in the UK was somewhat stronger than that recorded in continental Europe, with this strength continuing in the September quarter. The slowing across Europe was driven by falls in exports, particularly in France, Italy and the UK. Business investment was also very weak in line with the falls recorded in industrial production. In contrast, growth in consumption proved more resilient across most countries, particularly in Germany (where income tax cuts appear to have boosted consumer spending) and the UK, both of which had been subdued late in 2000. ", " Manufacturing production showed some signs of stabilising across Europe in the middle of the year, in line with a levelling out in business confidence. However business sentiment has fallen sharply over the past couple of months. The survey results may have been temporarily depressed following the terrorist attacks in the US. However if the survey results are indicative of renewed weakness in Europe, downward adjustments are likely to be made to investment plans and the pace of corporate retrenchment will accelerate. The declines in production in Europe earlier in the year appear already to be having an impact on employment growth, especially in Germany, with nearly all countries recording weaker employment outcomes over the course of this year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 8)</span>. One exception is the UK where the unemployment rate is around an historical low. ", " Inflationary pressures continue to ease in the euro area (Graph 9) with CPI inflation falling from its recent peak of 3.4 per cent in May to 2.5 per cent in September, as the impact of higher oil and food prices was unwound. When food and energy are excluded, inflation has drifted higher, though this is expected to be reversed in response to slower growth in aggregate demand and the effect of the recent appreciation of the euro. The ECB eased monetary policy by 25 basis points in late August, and by a further 50 basis points in mid September. Consumer prices in the UK have risen over the past year due to higher food prices in the wake of the foot and mouth disease problem. However, inflation remains around the Bank of England's inflation target of 2½ percent. The Bank of England also cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 per cent in mid September, citing concerns about world growth and the impact of the terrorist attacks, and by a further 25 basis points in early October. This brought the cumulative easing in the UK this cycle to 150 basis points. ", " The scope for discretionary fiscal policy to be eased across Europe in the year ahead in response to weaker conditions is constrained by the European Union Growth and Stability Pact, and the overall thrust of policy in 2002 is broadly neutral (Table 4). While most countries are well within the 3 per cent deficit ceiling that triggers penalties, the deficits are forecast to exceed the current Stability Program targets which set down an adjustment path for achieving balanced fiscal positions. In contrast, in the UK a mild fiscal easing is projected next year, following an easing equivalent to around ¾ of a percentage point of GDP this year. ", " The outlook for world economic growth in 2001 has been continually revised down this year, with significant revisions occurring before the terrorist attacks in the US. Surveys of private-sector forecasters, which attempt to take these events into account, imply world growth of around 2½ per cent in 2001 and around 3 per cent in 2002, well down on forecasts from three months ago (Graph 10). The impact on the major industrialised countries is expected to be greater and would take growth in both years to around that recorded in 1991. The impact on Australia's trading partners is also expected to be pronounced, with the degree of synchronisation of the current global economic slowdown having the potential to limit the scope for diversion of exports. ", " Macroeconomic policies are responding to this weakness. Central banks around the world have eased monetary policy in an effort to support demand, with real official interest rates in G7 countries now at their lowest level in over two decades (Graph 11). Fiscal settings have also become more accommodative, with major expansionary packages announced in the US and a number of Asian countries. Based on IMF forecasts, fiscal settings in the major industrialised countries have been broadly expansionary in 2001, Japan being the main exception. Given recent fiscal packages announced in the US and Asia and the impact of slower growth in government revenues due to weakening activity, it is likely that fiscal policy will also be expansionary in 2002. ", " The current cyclical downturn is different from those of the past few decades, in that monetary policy was not as tight prior to the downturn as in other episodes. However the structural imbalances that exist in some countries are large. At this stage, the most likely outcome for the major economies is that the recession in the second half of this year is followed by a modest recovery towards the middle of 2002. A faster recovery, which is characteristic of earlier cycles, is a possibility although the size of the imbalances that need to be unwound in the US, and the ongoing problems in Japan, suggest that this is unlikely. On the downside, there is a risk that the synchronised slowdown, coupled with heightened military tensions globally, will lead to a persistent fall in appetite for risk among businesses and much more conservative behaviour by households. ", " The process of monetary easing that has been evident in most industrial countries during the past year has continued in recent months, as central banks responded to growing signs of economic weakness and evidence that inflationary pressures are starting to diminish. ", " Central banks around the world acted quickly after the terrorist attacks to boost liquidity in their financial systems. The aim was to ensure that markets did not experience systemic failures resulting from disruptions in payments and settlements systems or the increase in risk aversion. To help calm markets, many central banks issued statements immediately after the attacks, outlining their intentions to provide liquidity support to their financial institutions. These measures were designed to ensure the continued smooth operation of markets rather than to change monetary conditions. The easings by central banks in September generally did not start until a week or so after the attacks. (Australia was an exception in that it had reduced interest rates in early September.) ", " On 17 September prior to the re-opening of US share markets (markets were closed for 4 working days – the longest shutdown since the 1930s) the US Federal Reserve announced a cut of 50 basis points in its official interest rates. It was followed over the next 48 hours by several other central banks. Subsequent to these steps, which in most instances occurred outside the central banks' regular policy schedules, many central banks followed up with further cuts in interest rates at their regular policy meetings (Graph 12). ", " The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates at every policy meeting this year, as well as on three occasions between meetings. In total, there have been 10 cuts in rates, amounting to 450 basis points. These have reduced the Fed funds target to 2.0 per cent, its lowest level since the early 1960s and 100 basis points below the low point seen in the early 1990s recession (Graph 13). Real short-term interest rates in the US are now around the lows seen in the early 1990s (Graph 14). Financial markets continue to price-in further rate reductions in the US over coming months. They expect the Fed funds target will fall to 1.75 per cent or lower. ", " Cumulative easings by other central banks have been significantly less than those of the US Fed. After the Fed, the largest easing has been by the Bank of Canada, which has reduced rates by 300 basis points in 2001. This includes a cut of 75 basis points on 23 October, which took the target cash rate to 2.75 per cent (Table 5). ", " The cumulative cuts this year by other central banks (excluding Japan) generally range from 100 to 175 basis points, with Australia at the top end of this range and the European Central Bank (ECB) at the lower end. ", " The current level of interest rates among industrial countries (leaving aside Japan where interest rates are at zero) ranges from 2.0 per cent in the US to 5.25 per cent in New Zealand. By historical standards, this range is both low and narrow (Graph 15). Among the English-speaking countries, nominal rates are generally at their lowest level for about 30 years. In Europe, while interest rates are low, they remain above the levels prevailing during the period of economic weakness in the late 1990s. The low level and relatively narrow range of interest rates around the world reflects the fact that inflation is also in a tight range, and low by historical standards. ", " Having reduced its interest rates to zero in March 2001, the Bank of Japan has since been directing its monetary policy to boosting banks' total reserves. Initially the target for reserves was set at 5 trillion yen, which was around 20 per cent above average reserve holdings over the previous year. It has since been increased to ‘over 6 trillion’ yen. Actual reserves rose above this for a time in the second half of September as banks sought to boost their liquidity ahead of their half-year balance date, and are currently at around 9 trillion yen. The Bank of Japan supplied the additional reserves ahead of end September partly by not sterilising intervention that it was undertaking in the foreign exchange market at that time. In other words, it allowed the yen that it delivered to banks in exchange for its purchases of US dollars to remain in the money market, rather than withdraw them by the sales of securities. ", " Asian central banks, with the exception of Bank Indonesia and Bank Negara, also have eased monetary policy over the past few months. In these countries, nominal interest rates are at low levels, generally in the range of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1–4 per cent</span>. This is well below the level of rates that followed the Asian financial crisis. Indonesia has not shared in this downward trend in interest rates; its rates have been rising since mid 2000 and are now about <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 per cent</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 16)</span>. This difference is largely explained by the much higher inflation rate in Indonesia, which over the past year was 13 per cent. ", " Interest rates in Latin America remain high due to concerns about the sustainability of Argentinean finances, despite further IMF support. Short-term peso interest rates in Argentina are around 60 per cent at present, substantially higher than their level at the time of the 1998 financial crisis. In Brazil, they are around 20 per cent, or about half their 1998 levels (Graph 17). ", " Long bond yields around the world have generally continued to fall over recent months. Lower official interest rates, downward revisions to growth prospects in virtually all countries and signs that inflation in most countries was receding were the main forces driving this. The terrorist attacks added to the downward pressure, particularly for government yields as investors sought to move into relatively safe investments. The fall in bond yields was most notable in the US, where 10-year US Treasury bond yields are down about 125 basis points from their level six months ago and 250 basis points from their peak in early 2000. Yields have fallen to 4.20 per cent, and intra-day fell to 4.1 per cent, the lowest level of bond yields since the mid 1960s (Graph 18). ", " Long yields in the US have not fallen as much as short rates this year, and are currently over 200 basis points above short rates (Graph 19). This gap is quite high by historical standards, indicating that monetary conditions in the US are relatively easy at present. The gap is not as wide as in the early 1990s, however, suggesting that, on this measure, monetary conditions are not as easy as in that earlier period. ", " The spreads between yields on government bonds and those on corporate bonds in the US were relatively steady over August and the first part of September, but rose noticeably after the 11 September terrorist attacks. This was because uncertainty created by those attacks led to a rise in risk aversion among investors and therefore a preference for government debt. The increase in spreads was most significant on riskier classes of fixed income debt; spreads on high quality AAA-rated paper did not react much. ", " Despite the recent rise, the current level of spreads for all the credit categories remains within the range of the past couple of years (Graph 20). That is, markets are not pricing-in an unusually severe deterioration in credit quality. ", " In European bond markets, yields have continued to take their lead from the US. However, while the direction of moves in Europe has mirrored the US, the amplitude has generally been less. German 10-year government bond yields have fallen by around 90 basis points over recent months, to 4.30 per cent. Consequently, the relativities between US and German 10-year government bonds changed sharply. Six months ago, US yields were about <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 basis points</span> above German yields but recently they have generally been below. ", " Yields on Japanese government bonds have tracked an independent course over recent months, with yields on 10-year government paper generally trading in a tight range between 1.30 per cent and 1.40 per cent. ", " In emerging markets, the focus remains on Argentina, where economic and financial conditions have failed to improve over the past three months. Although additional IMF assistance was forthcoming in August, investor concerns about the ability of the Argentine Government to meet debt obligations have remained. These concerns were exacerbated in early November when the government announced a plan to swap outstanding government debt with bonds yielding lower coupons. Although ostensibly ‘voluntary’, the swap plan has been interpreted by many in the financial markets as tantamount to default, with Standard and Poor's revising Argentina's sovereign credit rating down to ‘Selective Default’ from CC. Spreads between the country's sovereign debt and US Treasuries increased sharply on the announcement, by 400 basis points to over 2,400 basis points (Graph 21). The current level of spreads is higher than that reached in the mid-1990s crisis. Although events in Argentina have contributed to further rises in yields throughout Latin America, as well as in European emerging markets, the increases so far appear to be reasonably well contained. Spreads on Asian sovereign debt have remained remarkably stable despite events in Argentina. ", " The significant deterioration in the global economic outlook and continued disappointing earnings announcements, particularly by technology companies, have weighed heavily on equity markets over recent months. This equity market weakness mostly predated the terrorist attacks, with August being a particularly weak month in most countries. The terrorist attacks initially led to a further sharp fall in share prices, but by early October this had been unwound in most countries (Graph 22). ", " In the United States, the Wilshire Index, the broadest measure of US share prices (accounting for over <span class=\"no-wrap\">90 per cent</span> of listed companies) has fallen by 9 per cent since early August and is now 30 per cent below the peak in March 2000. The S&amp;P 500 has experienced similar falls, while the Nasdaq is down 12 per cent since early August, and 64 per cent from its early 2000 historical high. Since early 1995, when the last phase of the bull run in shares began, the Wilshire, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are now all showing similar net increases – about <span class=\"no-wrap\">120 per cent</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 23)</span>. The marked outperformance of the Nasdaq during 1999 and early 2000 has now been fully reversed. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Nasdaq index experienced a major bubble over this period, rising by 150 per cent over the 15 months to March 2000, only to reverse this over the following <span class=\"no-wrap\">twelve months</span> or so. ", " Earnings of companies in the US continue to be weak. For those companies in the S&amp;P 500, earnings declined by 34 per cent in the year to September. The fall in earnings over 2001 is likely to significantly exceed the <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> fall seen in 1991, the worst year for earnings in the early 1990s recession. ", " Despite the substantial falls in share prices since the early 2000 peaks, some traditional measures of share price valuation, such as price-earnings (P/E) ratios, remain relatively high. The current P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500, of around 29, remains well above its historical average of 16, even though it is down from the recent peak of 36 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 24)</span>. Likewise, the ratio of US share market capitalisation to nominal GDP remains well above its historical average (Graph 25). For this to be justified would require either that GDP in the future grow substantially faster than its historical average, or at least that the share of GDP going to company profits be higher than its historical average. ", " Share prices in other countries have generally followed those in the US, although in many cases falls have been even more pronounced than in the broad US markets (Table 6). The Euro Stoxx index (a broad index of 310 major Euro area companies) has fallen by 12 per cent since early August, and at one stage in late September was down by over double that amount. European markets tend to have quite a high exposure to the telco sector, which has been a particularly weak sector around the world. ", " The pattern in the Japanese share market over recent months has been similar to that in other major countries. The level is, however, much lower. Share price indices in Japan are around one third their level at the peak in 1990. ", " Asian equity markets have resumed their downward trend, after a brief period of stability around the middle of the year (Graph 26). In aggregate, Asian equity markets (excluding Japan and China) have fallen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">24 per cent</span> so far this year, but individual performance continues to vary. Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines have each fallen by around 30 per cent, while Korea has gained around 10 per cent on levels at the start of this year. Share prices in Latin America are also down by 12 per cent this year (Graph 27). They have been particularly weak in Argentina, where price falls since the start of the year have been in the order of <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span>. ", " The strong US dollar appreciation evident since 1995 was partly reversed around the middle of 2001 as the factors that supported the US dollar over the latter half of the 1990s disappeared. The interest rate differential with the rest of the world, for a long time positive to the US, turned negative against most major countries. Similarly, the growth gap in favour of the US closed and US productivity growth slowed (with historical data also having been revised weaker). Falls in the share market also reduced the attractiveness of US equities. ", " The events of 11 September initially caused the US dollar to fall further (Graph 28). The largest fall was against the Swiss franc, which rose due to increased ‘safe-haven’ flows following the terrorist attacks. The Swiss authorities expressed concern about the franc's appreciation (it rose by 7 per cent against the US dollar and <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> against the euro following the terrorist attacks) and cut interest rates by 50 basis points in response. The US dollar also fell noticeably against the yen. There were reports of repatriation of overseas investments by Japanese institutions to reduce their foreign exposures ahead of their September half-year end. The decline against the yen was resisted by significant intervention in the foreign exchange market by the Japanese authorities, who have repeatedly asserted that an appreciating yen is not consistent with the country's fundamentals. Swings in the US dollar/euro exchange rate have been more muted, though the euro remains at a relatively low level. ", " More recently demand in the foreign exchange market has again swung in favour of the US dollar. Investors seem to be of the view that the significant monetary and fiscal stimulus applied in the US since the September attacks will result in US economic activity recovering faster than in Europe (and Japan). The recent renewed strength of the US dollar means that its trade-weighted value is now only about 2 per cent below its July peak (Table 7). ", " Currencies of Asian emerging markets that float appreciated against the US dollar in July and August, but have since depreciated leaving them relatively unchanged (Graph 29). The exception is Indonesia, where the rupiah has appreciated by 7 per cent since July after resolution of uncertainties regarding the country's political leadership. Latin American currencies continued to slide due to contagion from problems in Argentina. The Brazilian real is down 24 per cent for this year, and the Chilean peso is down 18 per cent. ", " After trading steadily around US51–52 cents during the middle months of 2001, the Australian dollar has shown considerable volatility since (Graph 30). It rose noticeably in August, to reach almost US54 cents. A number of factors contributed to this, including a growing recognition among market participants that the Australian economy was performing more strongly than its US counterpart. Consensus forecasts for economic growth in Australia were holding up reasonably well, while US growth forecasts were being revised down sharply. This pattern was reflected in divergent trends in share markets in the two countries, with the Australian market remaining close to its peak while the US market was falling quite rapidly. Interest rate differentials were also moving increasingly in Australia's favour. In addition, the release of the June quarter balance of payments, indicating that Australia's current account deficit, as a proportion of GDP, had fallen to its lowest level since 1980, further boosted confidence in the currency. ", " Over late August and early September, as markets became increasingly concerned about the impact of the weakening global economy on Australia, the exchange rate of the Australian dollar began to fall. A weakening in the world economy has traditionally been seen by markets as a negative factor for the Australian dollar because, in the past, periods of global economic weakness have typically resulted in falls in commodity prices and in Australia's terms of trade, with consequential adverse effects on the balance of payments and the economy more generally. As noted in the chapter on the ‘<a href=\"#balance-of-payments\">Balance                                          of Payments</a>’, however, even though world economic activity has slowed over the past year and commodity prices have fallen, Australia's terms of trade have risen. This break from the traditional relationship, if sustained, should in due course result in the Australian dollar becoming more resilient to weakness in global economic growth. ", " The terrorist attacks in the US initially saw the Australian dollar rise amid a general movement away from US dollar denominated assets. But the situation changed quickly over subsequent days as risk aversion among international investors increased. The Australian currency fell sharply, not only against the US dollar but also against other major currencies. During this period, the pattern of investment flows seemed to indicate both a retreat by international investors to their home country and, within countries, a move from equities to relatively secure investments such as government bonds. The currencies that did best during this period were those of countries that have large creditor positions, such as the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. ", " Adding to the downward pressure on the exchange rate in the first half of September was a number of large, one-off corporate transactions which resulted in substantial sales of Australian dollars. Some of these hit the market immediately following the terrorist attacks and their timing partly explains the unusually sharp fall experienced by the Australian dollar during this period. ", " The Australian dollar reached a new low in trade-weighted terms of 46.0 in mid September; the previous low had been 47.1, reached in early April this year (Graph 31). Against the US dollar the exchange rate remained above its previous low of US47.75 cents. ", " By late September, as confidence started to re-emerge in markets, and with the large one-off transactions completed, the exchange rate stabilised and then recovered. The recovery was reinforced as market attention focused on the widening interest differential in favour of the Australian dollar. ", " Abstracting from the substantial volatility in the exchange rate over recent months, the current levels of both the US dollar rate and the trade-weighted index are broadly in line with the respective averages over the past year. ", " In view of the volatile conditions, the Bank undertook an increased amount of intervention in the foreign exchange market in September, buying in total about A$780 million in the market. Intervention operations in August and October were negligible. ", " The Australian economy has recorded moderate growth during 2001, although it remains somewhat slower than was recorded during the second half of the 1990s. Output expanded at an annualised rate of 3¼ per cent over the first half of this year, following the GST-related decline in the second half of 2000 (Graph 32). The main reason for the resumption of growth was that dwelling investment stopped falling (Table 8). A pick-up in growth of consumer spending and public demand also contributed, and exports continued to rise strongly. A similar pattern in growth was recorded across the states, with the pick-up in activity in the first half of 2001 being most marked in Queensland and Victoria. ", " The significant expansion in the housing sector that is currently in train should continue through much of this financial year, and will have flow-on effects to construction-related sectors. While the confidence of the household sector was adversely affected by the events of mid September, up until that time consumer confidence had been reasonably positive, supported by the ongoing growth in household incomes and assets and the reductions in interest rates since the beginning of the year. Continued strong growth in household credit should provide support for consumer spending in the period ahead. ", " Across the business sector, however, conditions have varied considerably over the year to date. Conditions in the construction sector and the construction-related parts of the manufacturing sector have clearly improved since the beginning of this year, and the low exchange rate has afforded a competitive advantage to export-oriented sectors. In contrast, conditions in parts of the services sector, particularly those that are information technology and communications (ITC) related, have deteriorated in line with global trends. Overall, the weakening in trading conditions since the middle of 2000, combined with some increases in costs, has contributed to a decline in aggregate measures of profitability. Although businesses generally recorded some improvement in conditions around the middle of the year, supported by easier fiscal and monetary policies, a corresponding improvement in investment intentions and employment was not observed. Businesses' external fund raisings, particularly through intermediaries, have also remained subdued. More recently, the worsening outlook for the world economy and uncertainty created by the events of mid September have increased the risks surrounding the outlook, particularly for export-oriented businesses. ", " Consumer spending increased strongly in the first half of 2001, following subdued growth in the second half of last year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 33)</span>. Spending on services (which accounts for around three-quarters of household consumption) has continued to grow very strongly, driven largely by rising expenditure on healthcare. Retail trade data suggest that robust growth continued in the September quarter, with the volume of retail sales increasing by 1.6 per cent, to be 5.8 per cent higher than a year earlier. Over the past few quarters, the strength in retail sales has been concentrated in hospitality and services, household goods and other retailing (particularly sales of pharmaceuticals). The pick-up in sales from household goods retailers has been consistent with the recovery of the dwelling construction sector. Households' purchases of motor vehicles have remained soft since the beginning of this financial year, in part reflecting the unwinding of the pre-GST growth in motor vehicle purchases. ", " Some of the recent strength in consumer spending has been underpinned by one-off factors. Consumer spending on healthcare has increased markedly over the past year; it increased by almost 25 per cent over the year to the June quarter and contributed around 1 percentage point to consumption growth over that period. In part, this appears to have been a consequence of the government's ‘Lifetime Health Cover’ initiative, which commenced on 1 July 2000. This initiative encouraged the take-up of private health insurance and it seems that the increased insurance cover has led to a significant increase in demand for health services (Graph 34). The disproportionate growth of consumer spending on healthcare relative to health services output in part reflects the large increase in spending on pharmaceuticals during this period. The $300 payment to aged pensioners in June, which was announced in the most recent Commonwealth budget, is also likely to have increased spending on a range of retail items in recent months; with more than 2.2 million people eligible for this payment, it amounts to a potential stimulus of over $660 million. ", " More generally, however, continued growth in household incomes, reductions in interest rates, lower petrol prices and modest growth in household assets have provided conditions conducive to the ongoing expansion in consumer spending. Real disposable income grew by 1.1 per cent in the June quarter, to be 3.7 per cent higher over the year. Although labour market conditions were relatively weak in the June quarter, this was offset by continued growth in wages and lower debt-servicing payments. The fall in the latter, stemming from the lowering of interest rates in the first half of the year, boosted household disposable income by around ½ of one percentage point in the June quarter. The growth in real disposable income over the past year also reflects the fact that, in aggregate, the lowering of tax rates and increases in transfer payments from July 2000 more than offset the increases in prices that occurred at that time (Graph 35). ", " The sharp fall in interest payments has led to a substantially lower household debt-servicing burden, although higher overall levels of household indebtedness mean that the debt-servicing burden is well above previous low points (Graph 36). Housing loan arrears, a lagging indicator of financial stress, remain a small share of total loans by historical standards. The measured saving ratio is currently above the average levels recorded in 1998 and 1999. ", " Household credit has grown by an annualised 17 per cent over the six months to September. The strength in household borrowing reflects a significant further expansion in both housing and personal credit, and should support consumption expenditure in the presence of subdued employment growth. The household debt to disposable income ratio has remained at its historical peak of 105 per cent. ", " On the other side of the balance sheet, the value of household assets increased by 3.7 per cent over the year to the June quarter, with robust growth being recorded in the first half of 2001 after somewhat subdued growth in the second half of 2000 (Table 9). In recent quarters, broad-based gains in dwelling prices and further increases in household financial assets, owing mainly to strong increases in holdings of equities, have contributed to this growth. The decline in equity markets since the middle of the year, however, will have reduced the value of households' financial assets. ", " Measures of consumer sentiment have broadly reflected developments in households' incomes and assets. In the June and September quarters, consumer sentiment, according to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute measure, was at a relatively high level, consistent with the reasonable pace of consumer spending that was recorded. In October, however, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the US, the deterioration in global growth prospects and the handover of Ansett airlines to administrators, consumer sentiment fell sharply (Graph 37). While large, the fall in sentiment was not unprecedented, being slightly less than the fall in March following the release of the December quarter national accounts. Much of the weakness in October was related to perceptions about economic conditions over the coming year, rather than concerns relating to personal finances. Despite these falls, consumer sentiment remains around its long-run average level. ", " Dwelling investment rose modestly in the first half of this year and the leading indicators suggest that considerably stronger growth is in prospect for the second half of the year. Early in the September quarter, both building approvals and loan approvals for new construction almost regained the peak levels recorded in early 2000 before easing a little in the latest monthly readings (Graph 38). The growth in dwelling investment over the first half of 2001 was concentrated in alterations and additions, and it appears that the recovery in house-building activity was delayed to some extent by the collapse of HIH Insurance. While liaison suggests that in most states the insurance-related delays have been resolved, some problems appear to have persisted in NSW. ", " Over the past couple of years, the cycle in dwelling construction activity has been significantly affected by government policies as well as the standard factors such as interest rates and affordability. The effect of the introduction of the GST in mid 2000 on dwelling construction activity has been discussed in previous <em>Statements</em>. More recently, the introduction of the First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) scheme and the Commonwealth Additional Grant (CAG) has assisted the entry of some first-home buyers into the market earlier than would have otherwise been the case. Given that the CAG was expected to expire at the end of December (and the recently announced extension of the CAG still implies some scaling back of the Grant from the beginning of 2002), it may also shift some activity into the next couple of quarters from later periods. Information collected by State Revenue Offices indicates a continued high level of grants issued, particularly for new housing <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 39)</span>. The effect of the government grants is also evident in the increase in the proportion of first-home buyers seeking finance for housing. While first-home buyers generally comprise around 25 per cent of loan approvals (excluding refinancing), the latest figures put their share around 30 per cent. The gap between these figures is suggestive of the additional stimulus that the government grants are having on the housing sector. The FHOG has provided stimulus to housing demand in all states, although its effect continues to be relatively large in the smaller states, where median house prices are lower. ", " While the effect of the government grants on housing investment is likely to be significant, the recovery in house purchases – both new and established – by non-first-home buyers and investors has also been robust. Since the trough in loan approvals to owner-occupiers in February, the number of loan approvals for first-home buyers has increased by around 60 per cent, while loan approvals to other owner-occupiers increased by around 30 per cent. Investor activity has also been particularly strong: in value terms, the growth in demand for housing loans by investors has been broadly similar to that of first-home buyers, suggesting that other factors, notably low interest rates, have also been important in the recovery. Part of the recovery in activity reflected a return to levels consistent with underlying demand in the housing sector. The pick-up has been stronger than this, however, and the current level of building approvals is well above most estimates of underlying demand. ", " Strong demand for housing has been reflected in an 8 per cent increase in house prices over the year to the June quarter 2001, according to stratified data published by the ABS (Graph 40). These data attempt to remove the effect of compositional change in the sample of houses sold; this has been important in aiding interpretation of price movements in recent quarters, given the significant changes in the proportion of first-home buyers in the market. House prices have increased most strongly in recent quarters in Melbourne and Canberra, although increases have been recorded in most capital cities. The Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA), which reports median house prices, indicates similar results to the ABS for Australia-wide house price movements. However, in contrast to the rise in house prices in Sydney in the June quarter reported by the ABS, REIA reported a fall, which partly reflected an increase in the proportion of lower-priced properties, particularly in the outer suburbs, which were purchased in the quarter. Large price increases were recorded in the inner suburbs of Sydney. There is now, however, mounting evidence that rental vacancy rates are rising, particularly for medium-density dwellings, so the relatively strong growth in medium-density construction in recent years may well be in the process of lessening excess demand pressures. ", " Output growth has continued to vary considerably across industries. After the sharp slowdown in the second half of 2000, modest improvements in activity in the construction sector occurred in the first half of 2001 (Graph 41). This has already been associated with an increase in manufacturing output, consistent with the close relationship between construction and related manufacturing industries. Other traditionally cyclical sectors, such as the transport and storage and retail and wholesale trade sectors, also recorded a strong increase in output in the June quarter, with the inventory overhang that accumulated during the second half of 2000 having been unwound to some extent. Some business-related service industries, however, which had been growing relatively strongly in recent years, reported a slowdown in growth in the June quarter. Part of the earlier growth was a result of preparations for the Olympics, Y2K and the new tax system, but the downturn has been exacerbated by the recent downturn in the global ITC industry. (See <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a> on ‘The Service Sectors’.) ", " Overall, businesses reported an improvement in conditions and confidence in the September quarter, prior to the events of mid September. A strong improvement in business conditions was reported in the September quarter NAB business survey, taking the index above its long-run average level, with the improvement being concentrated in domestically oriented industries, particularly construction, retail and wholesale (Graph 42). The NAB and Yellow Pages surveys suggest that the improvements were spread across small and large businesses. While the ACCI-Westpac survey and other surveys that focus on the manufacturing sector reported that actual conditions remained relatively subdued in the September quarter, they did record a strong rise in business confidence for the next three to six months. In contrast to the results for the domestically oriented sectors, the September quarter NAB survey reported a deterioration in conditions for businesses exposed to the international economy, particularly mining. This suggests that slowing world economic growth was beginning to have an effect prior to the terrorist attacks in the US. ", " Not surprisingly, surveys conducted after mid September have reported a marked deterioration in business confidence. The September NAB monthly survey reported a large fall in business confidence, taking the series to its lowest level since its inception in 1997, and below all quarterly readings for this survey since 1991. All sectors reported a fall in confidence, with particularly sharp falls recorded for those sectors incorporating insurance and tourism, reflecting their greater exposure to recent events. The September readings from the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey and the ACCI Survey of Investor Confidence show similar effects. To infer strong implications from this recent deterioration in sentiment for activity would be premature, as it is unclear whether it will be sustained and, if it is, how it will affect business decisions. In particular, it remains unclear whether firms feel more confident about their own operations than about the national economy, which, if true, could have a mitigating effect on business decisions. This occurred during the Asian crisis and there is some evidence in recent survey responses from the ACCI Survey of Investor Confidence that this may be occurring in the current episode. Prospects for the tourism industry, however, have clearly been adversely affected by these developments. (See <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> on ‘The Tourism Industry’.) ", " Even prior to mid September, the recorded improvements in business conditions and confidence had not had an appreciable effect on businesses' investment intentions, suggesting an underlying degree of caution within the business sector. These results were consistent with the weakness in business investment that continued into the June quarter. In aggregate, investment fell by nearly 5 per cent in the quarter, with a sharp 9 per cent fall in expenditure on machinery and equipment more than offsetting a modest rise in non-dwelling construction activity. Both components of investment have been very subdued over the past couple of years, and are now well below long-run average shares of GDP (Graph 43). ", " According to the June quarter ABS capital expenditure survey, the outlook for machinery and equipment investment for the 2001/02 financial year has also weakened. These data now imply that nominal growth in equipment investment in 2001/02 will be below 3 per cent, assuming five-year average realisation ratios. Given the recent further slowing in world growth and heightened levels of uncertainty, however, it is likely that a lower realisation ratio is more appropriate. Much of the expected growth in equipment investment continues to be concentrated in the mining sector, which has been partially insulated from the deterioration in global conditions by the low value of the Australian dollar. Investment in motor vehicles, which represents around a quarter of overall machinery and equipment investment, has, to date, received only a small boost as a result of the recently announced changes to the tax treatment of business purchases of motor vehicles. ", " Investment in buildings and structures is starting to recover, rising by nearly 2 per cent in the June quarter, largely due to an increase in engineering construction. Following considerable weakness in the 2000/01 financial year, the outlook for expenditure on buildings and structures has improved. The strong growth in non-residential building approvals early in 2001, and the improvement in other forward-looking indicators, such as commencements and work-yet-to-be-done, points to a pick-up in non-residential construction activity in the quarters ahead. Support for such activity has been provided by vacancy rates in office property, which remain low by historical standards, and market valuations of property trusts, which have continued to rise. The ABS capital expenditure survey, which reported a strong rise in expected investment in buildings and structures for 2001/02, and the improvement in the value of projects currently under construction or committed, as reported in the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em>, also point to an improvement in the outlook for investment in buildings and structures. A considerable proportion of this growth is expected to come from mining-related sectors. ", " The slowdown in expenditure on intangible fixed assets has continued, with overall investment declining slightly in the June quarter. The main driver of the decline was further weakness in expenditure on computer software (which accounts for around 80 per cent of intangible fixed asset investment); demand for computer software continues to slow in the post-‘tech boom’ environment and following the boost provided by Y2K and the pre-GST spending on computing and accounting systems. Mineral and petroleum exploration fell in the June quarter, although it remains higher over the year and is expected to be strong over the next six months, reflecting the highly competitive position of the mining sector. ", " Subdued profits, reflecting increased cost pressures, high levels of competition, and weaker trading conditions, are likely to have contributed to the weakness in business investment. Corporate sector profits, as measured in the national accounts, have fallen significantly since mid 2000 and fell by a further 4.2 per cent in the June quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 44)</span>. Combined with revisions to recent history, which suggest that corporate profitability was not quite as strong as previously thought, these falls imply that corporate profits as a share of GDP have fallen slightly below their average for the past decade. ", " Mining profits increased by around 14 per cent over the year to the June quarter, driven by both strong output growth and higher commodity prices in Australian dollar terms. In contrast, manufacturing profits have fallen by close to 20 per cent, but some recovery may be expected with the recent and prospective strength in the housing sector. The recovery in the housing sector should also be positive for profits of the small business sector, which – as measured by the gross operating surplus (GOS) of unincorporated enterprises – grew by just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the June quarter, but remained slightly below the level prevailing a year earlier. ", " The financial position of businesses, however, generally remains sound (Graph 45). Lower official interest rates have contributed to the corporate net interest burden falling in the June quarter, to be 21 per cent of GOS, which is quite low by historical standards. The debt to equity ratio also fell in the June quarter. Although loan arrears are increasing, associated with difficult trading conditions, they remain at low levels as a share of credit. ", " Consistent with the weakness in business investment and businesses' generally subdued assessment of current conditions, business borrowing from intermediaries has been particularly weak, falling by around 1 per cent over the six months to September on an annualised basis (Graph 46). Bank data suggest that the slowing in business credit over the year to June has been broadly comparable between large and small business, although small business credit (loans under $500,000) has been growing consistently at around half the pace of that to large business. Large firms may have switched to obtaining funding directly from financial markets. Fund raising through non-intermediated debt remained at reasonable levels in the six months to September, with issuance for much of 2001 concentrated in bonds at the expense of commercial paper, perhaps reflecting perceptions of favourable rates for long-term funding. To date in 2001, equity raisings have been around the average levels of recent years, with particular strength recorded in the September quarter, predominantly through private placements rather than floats. When taken together, however, net external fund raisings thus far in 2001 have been somewhat lower as a share of GDP than in the past several years (Graph 47). ", " The Government announced that the Commonwealth budget recorded an underlying cash surplus of $5.6 billion in 2000/01 (Table 10). This was around $2.8 billion higher than was originally estimated in May 2000, despite the fact that the economy's growth rate for the year was about half as strong as forecast. Tax receipts from both companies and individuals were considerably higher than initially expected (by about $6.7 billion or 1 per cent of GDP), partly due to the lower than expected take-up of deferral arrangements for paying company tax and perhaps reflecting an expansion of the tax base following the introduction of the new tax system. As a partial offset, however, government spending was also higher than forecast, due to several factors including the introduction of a range of discretionary spending initiatives mainly affecting the second half of the year. ", " In October, the Commonwealth Government updated its economic forecasts and estimate of the budget position in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO). The expected underlying cash surplus for 2001/02 was revised down by $1 billion to around $500 million, and the estimate for 2002/03 was broadly unchanged. The revision for 2001/02 reflected an upward revision to expenses arising from discretionary policy decisions and the effect of higher forecasts for CPI inflation and wages growth, although this was partly offset by upward revisions to revenue. ", " The revised estimates of the underlying cash surplus in recent and forthcoming years suggest that the fiscal impact on growth, including the contribution of automatic stabilisers and discretionary measures, was around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1¼ percentage</span> points in 2000/01 and will be around ¾ of a percentage point this year. At this stage, state budget estimates imply that very little fiscal stimulus is likely to come from the states. ", " Labour force data and partial indicators of labour demand indicate that conditions in the labour market continue to be weak (Graph 48). Employment increased by 0.5 per cent in the three months to October, to be 0.5 per cent above the corresponding period a year earlier. The participation rate has remained, on average, around <span class=\"no-wrap\">63.8 per cent</span> over the past six months, and the unemployment rate has averaged 6.9 per cent. In October, however, the unemployment rate increased to 7.1 per cent. ", " While total employment growth has been weak through most of the past year, the full-time and part-time components have exhibited markedly different trends and considerable volatility. Full-time employment has declined over the past year, to be 1.1 per cent lower in the three months to October than a year earlier. Part-time employment, on the other hand, increased by 5.0 per cent over this period. The considerable volatility from month to month in these components is difficult to explain. An increase in the proportion of workers who are working around 35 hours, the cut-off used by the ABS in its classification of workers as being full-time versus part-time, may have contributed. The temporary employment of workers by the ABS to conduct the Census is estimated to have had little effect on these figures. Interestingly, in previous periods of labour market weakness there have been similar increases in the monthly volatility of full-time and part-time employment, as well as similarly divergent trends in these components. ", " As is the case for developments in economic activity more generally, the aggregate employment numbers also mask divergent trends across industries (Table 11). Employment in the construction industry increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.2 per cent</span> over the three months to August, following a slight increase over the three months to May. While this growth appears to be relatively modest compared with the increase in construction output that the national accounts and forward indicators of dwelling construction activity have implied for the June and September quarters, it suggests that measured labour productivity in the construction industry may be in the process of returning to more normal levels, having fallen to very low levels during the second half of 2000. Employment in the manufacturing industry has remained weak, falling by 3.1 per cent over the three months to August following a small fall over the previous three months, largely due to continued falls in employment in the construction-related parts of the manufacturing sector. The weakness in the output of the business service industries over the last six months has corresponded with a decline in employment in these sectors. (See <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a> on ‘The Service Sectors’ for a further discussion of these developments.) ", " The Victorian labour market has continued to be the most resilient of all the state labour markets, recording the highest growth in employment over the year to the latest three months (Table 12). Above-average growth in employment has also been recorded in both Western Australia and Queensland, over the past year, while employment in South Australia and Tasmania has fallen. ", " Labour productivity, as measured by output per hour worked in the non-farm economy, increased by 1.2 per cent in the June quarter, after having exhibited little growth over the preceding year. Short-term developments in productivity always reflect both trend and cyclical movements, which cannot easily be separated, but productivity outcomes during the past year or so have been similar to the experience of the mid-1990s slowdown. ", " Forward-looking indicators of the labour market have been mixed. The major business expectations surveys, taken before the events of mid September, had recorded a significant improvement in the outlook for the labour market in the second half of 2001, on the back of the improvement in business conditions more generally (Graph 49). This improvement was not, however, reflected in the vacancies data. While the ANZ and Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) newspaper-based vacancy indexes had stopped falling, they were broadly flat over the six months to September. The ABS employer-based measure of vacancies fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span> in the September quarter, although its pace of decline has also slowed. Since mid September, most surveys have presented a more subdued outlook for the labour market. The October DEWRSB and ANZ vacancies indexes both recorded declines, although these were not particularly large by historical standards. Overall, these forward-looking indicators suggest that employment will remain soft for a while yet. ", " The slowdown in the world economy over the course of the year has been reflected in slower growth in export volumes and a decline in the world price of a number of commodities, both exported and imported by Australia. The low level of the exchange rate, however, has helped insulate the economy from the full effects of moderating external demand. Import volumes continued to fall in the September quarter, offsetting a decline in export volumes, so that net exports are likely to have had little impact on GDP growth in the quarter, after adding two percentage points to growth over the year to the June quarter. Primarily reflecting the likely rise in the terms of trade in the September quarter, the trade surplus widened further, after the first surplus in four years was recorded in the March quarter (Graph 50). Consequently, the current account deficit is likely to have narrowed further from its 20-year low in the June quarter, to be around 1¾ per cent of GDP in the September quarter, assuming no change in the net income deficit as a share of GDP. ", " Some of the narrowing in the current account deficit over the past couple of years is the result of an improvement in Australia's terms of trade, which have risen by about 9½ per cent from the Asian-crisis lows. The rise in the terms of trade has also provided a significant boost to domestic incomes and living standards. It is unusual for Australia's terms of trade to be rising at this stage of the world economic cycle, and this reflects the strength in some export prices, particularly coal and beef prices, as well as falling prices for electronic goods, which Australia imports. The weaker world outlook may be reflected in falls in the prices of rural and resource commodities in the period ahead, but the effect on the terms of trade will be limited by the prospect of further falls in the prices of electronics and other manufactured goods. ", " The value of exports fell in the September quarter, but is still 6 per cent higher over the year. The decline was particularly large in manufactured exports. Merchandise export growth to most regions has slowed over the past year, though this has been particularly noticeable for exports to those regions experiencing the sharpest downturns, such as countries in east Asia (Graph 51). The slowing in demand from the ITC-producing countries, such as Singapore and Taiwan, has been most pronounced. Growth in exports to Japan, while slowing, has been underpinned by firm demand for resources and, to a lesser extent, rural products. The strongest growth in the value of merchandise exports over the past year has been to China, where export values have risen by just under 40 per cent. These exports may receive a further boost following China's accession into the WTO. With growth in the major regions slowing simultaneously, however, Australian exporters will find it more difficult to divert products to alternative markets than was the case during the Asian crisis. ", " The value of resource exports fell in the September quarter, though this followed a large rise in the previous quarter (Graph 52). After adjusting for probable movements in resource prices in the September quarter, there appears to be some levelling out in resource export volumes over the past few quarters. Looking ahead, the low levels of spending on exploration and investment in mining in recent years will continue to limit growth in production. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), Australian mine production will rise by around 1 per cent in 2001/02, compared with an increase of nearly 7 per cent in 2000/01. Production of base metals is forecast to increase by around 2 per cent in 2001/02. Production of energy is forecast to remain fairly flat with a moderate expansion of production in the coal, uranium and gas industries being offset by lower output of crude oil owing to a decline in productivity of a number of mature oil fields. ", " The value of rural exports has continued to rise due to high levels of production and firm prices. The gains have been particularly marked in meat exports, although growth in the Japanese market, which accounts for more than one-third of Australia's beef and veal exports by weight, has slowed recently following the discovery of ‘mad cow’ disease in Japan. The value of cereal exports has been flat this year as production has fallen from the very high levels recorded in the past three years. Higher livestock prices have also encouraged some substitution away from crops. Wool exports have softened due to wool supply being at an historic low. According to ABARE, the volume of farm production is expected to increase by a little over 1 per cent in 2001/02. Increases in beef and veal production are expected to be partially offset by small declines in crop production and a reduction in the supply of wool. ", " The manufacturing and service export sectors tend to be most affected by weakness in the world economy <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 53)</span>. Manufactured export volumes, after growing by 17 per cent over the year to the March quarter, fell in the June quarter and are likely to have fallen again in the September quarter, reflecting the weakness in Australia's trading partners, with a marked slowdown in exports of machinery. Growth in service exports, after abstracting from the Olympics, has moderated over the past year, although the value of service exports rose in the September quarter, boosted by a pick-up in sports-related arrivals. However, overseas arrivals fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> in September, with sharp falls in arrivals from the US and Japan. ", " The slower growth in domestic demand over the year to June, combined with the low exchange rate, was reflected in a fall in import volumes over the past year (Graph 54). The decline in import volumes has been <span class=\"no-wrap\">broad-based</span>, with large falls recorded in imports of capital and intermediate goods, both of which declined by more than 9 per cent over the year to June (Graph 55). The outcome for capital goods was in line with weak investment over the past year, though the disproportionately large fall in capital imports suggests that firms may have increasingly sourced their capital goods from domestic producers, most likely in response to higher capital import prices. The import penetration ratio has steadied over the past year or so, after being on a strong upward trend for most of the 1990s. ", " The net income deficit in the June quarter remained around 3 per cent of GDP, where it has been for more than three years. The ratio of net interest payments to exports fell to under 9 per cent in the June quarter owing to payments on net debt declining as interest rates fell, and exports rising. This compares with a peak of over <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent in 1990</span>. ", " There were substantial net equity inflows and debt outflows in the June quarter, in contrast to the trend evident since mid 1999. There has been a noticeable pick-up in net portfolio equity investment inflows from the US in 2001. Australia's net foreign debt fell in the June quarter to $311 billion, or 46 per cent of GDP, though this was offset by an increase in net foreign equity liabilities (Graph 56). Overall, net foreign liabilities remain at just under 60 per cent of GDP. ", " The RBA commodity price index has fallen in foreign-currency terms by a little over 2 per cent from its peak in June, although it is still about 15 per cent higher than the trough recorded in the first half of 1999. The trend in this index has been quite different to that of some other commonly used indexes, notably the CRB index <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 57)</span>. This reflects the stronger performance of key rural and resource prices over the past year. In Australian dollar terms, commodity prices are at very high levels and are 43 per cent higher than the low point reached in early 1999, partly due to the depreciation of the exchange rate since then. ", " Rural commodity prices have risen over the course of this year, but prices for some rural commodities have begun to ease over the past month or so (Table 13). Beef and veal prices remain high as restrictions on South American beef exporters, arising from concerns about foot and mouth disease, and drought conditions in parts of the US have limited global supply. Wool prices, however, have edged lower as Chinese demand has softened and European buyers have been largely absent from the market. ", " Base metals prices have continued to fall, reflecting the deterioration in the outlook for world growth (Graph 58). Aluminium prices, which had held up early in the year due to the effects of production cuts in the US, have resumed their downward trend, in line with most other base metals prices. Demand from the automotive, consumer durable and engineering sectors in the US has declined quite sharply, while falling electricity prices have increased the possibility of an expansion in US production. Nickel and copper prices have been under considerable downward pressure following slowing demand and a consequent build-up in inventories. ", " The price of gold rose to over US$290 an ounce following the terrorist attacks in the US, with the commodity receiving some ‘safe-haven’ support. It has since returned to around US$270, where it has traded for much of the past year. In Australian dollar terms, however, the gold price is back around the highs of the Asian financial crisis. Preliminary negotiations are under way for next year's round of price-setting for coal and iron ore contracts. Spot prices for thermal coal have eased recently, though they remain close to the contract prices due to tight supply conditions. Industry analysts expect reductions in world steel production to limit any upward pressure on iron ore and coking coal prices. ", " After spiking briefly following the terrorist attacks on the US, oil prices have fallen below the bottom of OPEC's target range, with the benchmark West Texas intermediate oil price now trading at around US$20 a barrel, a two-year low (Graph 59). The weaker global outlook was the main factor behind the fall. Despite the approaching northern hemisphere winter and talk of OPEC production cuts, oil prices are expected to remain subdued in the near term, reflecting softness in world demand. ", " Some of Australia's imports are also experiencing long-term price declines typical of the trend decline in the prices of rural and resource commodities that has occurred over past decades. Telecommunications and data processing equipment, which account for just under 10 per cent of Australia's imports, have experienced large price reductions over the past ten years. This primarily is a result of the fall in the price of electronic hardware underpinned by sharp declines in the price of memory chips, as well as falling software prices reflecting technological innovations. Lower prices for a range of internationally traded manufactured goods have also been a feature of recent years. ", " The fall in import prices, which has been particularly marked since the mid 1990s, has contributed to a rise in the terms of trade, boosting living standards in Australia (Graph 60). The terms of trade have risen almost continuously since their late-1998 trough. More recently, the fall in technology-related prices has provided a significant boost to the terms of trade in circumstances during which, historically, the terms of trade have tended to decline. ", " Renewed concerns about prospects for the global economy have seen further significant falls in market interest rates on both short and long-term debt in Australia in recent months. This trend accelerated late in the quarter following the terrorist attacks in the US. ", " Around the middle of the year, expectations for further monetary easing in Australia had largely disappeared as markets increasingly recognised the continuing good performance of the domestic economy. In August, however, expectations of a further easing in domestic monetary policy began to emerge. The main force behind this was the increasing gloom about the global outlook, as this was seen as eventually weighing on the domestic economy. Concerns about the international economy have continued to be an important influence on markets since. They were reinforced by the events of 11 September. ", " The first easing of monetary policy took place on 5 September, and although the money markets took it in their stride, there were some views expressed doubting the need for action at that time. The second easing a month later, and therefore after the events of 11 September, was fully anticipated and caused no reaction. The two reductions have taken the cash rate to 4.5 per cent, 25 points below the previous low which occurred in both the late 1990s and early 1990s (Graph 61). Comparisons further back in history are complicated because targets for the cash rate were not announced before the 1990s, but the last time the cash rate had averaged a level this low over a month was in 1973. ", " Yields on 90-day bank bills have fallen a little more than the cash rate in recent months as markets have priced in additional monetary easings in the months ahead. Yields are currently at 4.2 per cent, compared with a little over 5 per cent in early July. Like the cash rate, the current level of bill yields is the lowest for about 30 years. ", " The decline in interest rates in Australia has been smaller than has occurred in the US. Hence the spread between the cash rate in the two countries has widened to 250 basis points from 125 basis points in mid year (Graph 62). Markets expect this differential to narrow a little over coming months. ", " A positive spread between Australian and US cash rates has been the norm, though there was an unusual period in the late 1990s when the Australian rate was below that in the US. The current spread is higher than in <span class=\"no-wrap\">the mid 1990s</span> but lower than that in the early 1990s. ", " Yields on medium and long-term bonds in Australia have also declined by significant margins in recent months. Bond yields started the September quarter at their highest levels for 2001. However, the deterioration in the global economic outlook that emerged midway through the quarter and the consequential concerns about Australia's growth saw bond yields fall sharply from around 6.25 per cent in July, to around 5.50 per cent by early September. The terrorist attacks in the US resulted in further modest declines in long-term interest rates, as did the lower-than-expected CPI outcome in late October. Yields on 10-year bonds are now around 5.0 per cent, around 120 basis points lower than at the start of July (Graph 63). ", " The differential between Australian and US bond yields – which had widened significantly over the June quarter as prospects for the two economies diverged – has tended to move in a fairly stable range of between 70 and 100 basis points over recent months. Most recent trading has been around 85 basis points. ", " The events in the US on 11 September generated a sharp increase in banks' demand for liquidity when Australian markets opened the following day. Like other central banks, the RBA responded with substantial injections of liquidity to meet the demand (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). In the event, the payments system was able to continue operating normally, although trading in some securities markets remained subdued for several days. ", " Interbank price-making in the underlying market for Treasury and semi-government bonds was very limited for a few days after the terrorist attacks and client business was undertaken on a ‘best endeavours’ basis. In contrast to the lower activity in physical bond and repo markets, trading in interest rate futures and options on the Sydney Futures Exchange was little affected in the aftermath of 11 September. The futures market played an important role in facilitating risk management and price discovery through this period. ", " Corporate bond yields have fallen in recent months, but not as much as government yields – i.e. there has been a rise in the credit spreads on corporate bonds (Graph 64). The events of 11 September were an important factor. Except for the lowest-rated bonds, about three quarters of that rise has now been reversed. ", " There was virtually no trading in the corporate bond market in the first two days after 11 September. While trading of domestic issues resumed on Friday 14 September, market-makers were reluctant to trade bonds issued by US investment banks and insurance companies because of their direct exposure to US events. Although trading in AAA-rated bonds and bonds issued by Australian banks returned to normal levels by 20 September, for the overall market trading volumes were around one-third their normal level. The Australian experience was similar to that seen in overseas markets; trading in investment-grade bonds was running at about a third of normal volumes in the US and Europe in the week ending 21 September. ", " Australian credit spreads remain well below US spreads. In the US, adjustment to the 11 September shock has come through a sustained widening in spreads rather than a decline in issuance volumes, which have continued at high levels (Graph 65). By contrast, adjustment in our market (and the European market to some extent) is working mainly through quantity (see ‘<a href=\"#debt-markets\">Debt                                          markets</a>’ below). ", " Reductions in the cash rate target in September and October were passed on completely and quickly to almost all borrowers offering residential property as security (ordinary mortgages, home equity personal loans and residentially secured small business loans). Interest rate reductions have been smaller for small businesses offering other security, and for credit card borrowers. ", " All types of mortgage lenders have passed on in full to residential mortgage rates both the September and October easings in policy (Graph 66). The current average standard variable rate of the banks, at 6.3 per cent, is 20 basis points below the previous cyclical low in 1999 and is at its lowest level since March 1970. The average basic rate fell to 5.75 per cent, the lowest mortgage rate since July 1968. ", " In the case of small business loans, not all banks have passed reductions in the cash rate on to all types of loans. Whereas the margin between the cash rate and small business loans secured by residential property has remained roughly constant, the margins for other small business loans have widened in the past two months (Table 14). When combined with the increase that occurred in the first half of 2000, as banks increased some business lending rates independently of changes in the cash rate, the margin is now up to 40 basis points above its level in 1998/99. ", " For mortgage and small business loans that carry a fixed interest rate, the interest rates at which new loans are being offered have fallen in line with rates in capital markets. The declines have brought most fixed rates to levels close to their low points of earlier this year and similar to the cyclical low points reached in 1998. Approvals for fixed-rate housing loans have remained below 10 per cent of total housing loan approvals so far this year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 67)</span>. ", " Domestic non-government bond issuance was again strong in the September quarter, totalling <span class=\"no-wrap\">$9 billion</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 68)</span>. The proportion of issues in the form of asset-backed securities rose to about half. Issues of asset-backed securities have remained strong since the terrorist attacks, though issues of corporate bonds have fallen away (Table 15). Total non-government bonds outstanding are now just over $100 billion. ", " The strong increase in asset-backed securities, most of which have been residential mortgage-backed, reflects solid demand for housing loans in the economy. There has been a strong appetite from overseas investors for these bonds, and an increased proportion of asset-backed deals has been placed directly in offshore markets. During the September quarter, about half of all asset-backed securities were issued offshore. ", " Although most asset-backed securities are backed by residential mortgages, the domestic asset-backed market has become more diverse, with issues of securities backed by car loans, yet-to-be completed residential units and non-conforming residential loans during the September quarter. (Non-conforming borrowers include those with a history of not meeting repayments or those whose credit history is difficult to establish, such as the self-employed and new migrants.) ", " The asset-backed sector was, briefly, adversely affected by the terrorist attacks in the US. Most issuers of residential mortgage-backed securities rely on mortgage insurance to support the credit quality of their securities. Ratings agencies placed a number of residential mortgage-backed securities on negative credit watch in the light of concerns about their mortgage insurer's exposure to losses in the US, though these were subsequently removed in mid October. ", " Issuance by corporates was a modest $1.5 billion in the September quarter. While issuance began the quarter strongly, it slowed in August and ground to a halt in September. Only four non-asset-backed issues have been placed in the domestic market since then. Broader concerns about corporate credit quality have also held back issuance. Out of the 114 rated entities in the corporate sector of Australia and New Zealand rated by Standard and Poor's, 32 corporates have been downgraded this year while only seven have been upgraded. ", " Issuance is expected to be boosted in coming months in order to refinance a large number of maturities of existing corporate bonds. Scheduled maturities over the December quarter amount to $4.4 billion, almost double the total volume of maturities observed throughout the previous three quarters (Graph 69). Prospective maturities for 2002 stand at $9.8 billion, compared with $6.7 billion in 2001. ", " Changes to the associates test applied when determining whether debt security holdings are subject to interest withholding tax were announced in early September. Onshore associates (Australian residents or non-residents conducting business through a permanent establishment in Australia) of domestic debt issuers will now be exempt from interest withholding tax. ", " Whereas most share market indices overseas have been falling since early 2000, the Australian market continued to rise through to mid 2001. It did not experience the excesses seen overseas in earlier years, and therefore has not been not subject to the corrections now taking place overseas. Even though the Australian market fell over July and August, the falls were smaller than those overseas, so the relative performance continued to improve. The immediate reaction to the terrorist attacks was very similar across most countries, including Australia, as was the subsequent recovery (Graph 70). ", " The Australian share market index is currently about 6 per cent below its peak, whereas markets in most overseas countries are down about 25–40 per cent from their peaks, most of which were in early 2000. This relatively strong performance of the Australian market has helped to close the gap that opened up between the Australian and overseas markets in earlier years. Since 1995, the Australian market has risen by a net 50 per cent, which is the same as the increases in the UK and Canada, though still less than the increase of around 70 per cent in the broad US indices. Part of the divergence between the Australian and the US markets can be attributed to the different policies relating to dividend payments and share buy backs in the two countries (see <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>). ", " The Australian share market remained open throughout September, and no operational problems were reported. Trading levels at the Australian Stock Exchange and in the market for Share Price Index futures at the Sydney Futures exchange were around historical norms. ", " In August and September most of the largest listed companies reported their results for the first six months of this year. Overall, profits were flat compared with those earned in the first half of 2000. These results were broadly in line with market expectations. Profits for the full year 2000 were up by 32 per cent. ", " Industrial companies' profits fell 6 per cent in the latest half year. This outcome was affected by the losses in the media sector due to weakness in advertising revenue and losses on investments. Banks performed strongly compared to the other sectors with a rise of 20 per cent. For industrial companies other than in the bank and media sectors, profits fell 3 per cent. Resource companies produced a 35 per cent increase in profits in the first half of 2001, higher than the banking sector. ", " During the course of the past year, analysts' expectations for earnings growth have been revised down. Downward revisions in earnings estimates through the year tend to be the norm, but those for 2001 were larger than usual (Graph 71). Currently, analysts expect full-year 2001 earnings per share to be only slightly above <span class=\"no-wrap\">last year's</span> results. Expected earnings per share are up by 15 per cent in 2002. ", " The Australian Price Earnings (PE) ratio has been fairly steady this year and is currently 23 (Graph 72). In contrast, the US PE ratio has risen over the past few months to stand at 29. This has occurred despite the fall in share prices, and reflects the very sharp falls in corporate profitability in that country. ", " The 11 September events caused the deferment of some initial public offerings. For the September quarter as a whole, initial public offerings were slightly down on the levels seen in the previous quarter, with 15 companies raising a total of $297 million. Such raisings have slowed sharply in October. ", " In contrast, equity raisings by existing listed companies (for example, via placements and rights issues) have remained strong into October (Graph 73). During October, $1.5 billion was raised via placements. Moreover, the two largest raisings in October were oversubscribed. ", " The strength of total equity raisings through the September quarter was not sufficient, however, to offset the slowdown in non-intermediated debt raisings and the fall in intermediated credit. Total business external funding was $3.2 billion, well below the levels seen in previous quarters. ", " Growth in margin lending for equities and managed funds during the September quarter was well down on the rapid growth seen in the previous 12 months (Table 16). There was almost no change in the average level of credit limit usage but average leverage increased slightly between the June and September quarters. In response to the volatility of markets during the month of September, the number of margin calls was high relative to past quarters. ", " Financial conditions have eased further since the last <em>Statement</em>, with the cash rate now at its lowest level in almost 30 years. Interest rates on loans from intermediaries and financial market debt instruments are also at historically low levels. While household borrowing continues to rise strongly, business financing has been more subdued, reflecting softer demand for funds. As described in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’, the domestic equity market has been volatile, but remains within 6 per cent of its peak. The yield curve has maintained its positive slope and the exchange rate remains at an historically low level. ", " The 25 basis point reductions in the cash rate in September and October have taken the cumulative easing this cycle to 175 basis points. The magnitude of the easing cycle remains comparable to most major countries, with the notable exception of the US where the relatively weaker outlook has prompted a more aggressive monetary policy response. ", " While changes in interest rates attract much attention and can have an influence on consumer and business sentiment, the level of interest rates is likely to be of greater importance for economic activity. In both nominal and real terms, interest rates across the yield curve and most lending rates of intermediaries are at, or around, the lowest in almost 30 years. As outlined in previous <em>Statements</em>, one approximate benchmark for assessing the stance of monetary policy is the average real cash rate over the period since 1992, during which there has been, on average, stable inflation and favourable growth outcomes. The current level of the real cash rate, calculated using core inflation, remains substantially below this average (Graph 74). Against this benchmark, real borrowing rates charged by intermediaries are lower again because of the reduction in interest rate margins charged over the course of the 1990s. ", " The slope of the yield curve (beyond maturities of around one year) has remained broadly unchanged in recent months (Graph 75). (At the very short end, the yield curve is negatively sloped reflecting market expectations of further easing in monetary policy in the period ahead.) The current positive slope is consistent with perceptions of accommodative monetary policy and continued economic growth. ", " Market-determined interest rates on lower-rated corporate debt suggest a somewhat more cautious outlook in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the US, with spreads to lower-risk government debt generally widening, although the level of yields across the credit spectrum remains relatively low. ", " Credit grew at an annualised rate of around 8 per cent over the six months to September. This slowdown in credit growth masks quite disparate borrowing behaviour by households and businesses (Graph 76). ", " Households continue to borrow at a rapid pace, with household credit rising at an annualised rate of 17 per cent over the six months to September. The strength in household borrowing reflects a significant increase in lending for housing to both owner-occupiers and investors underpinned by the low level of mortgage interest rates and, to a lesser extent, the First Home Owners' Grant scheme. The current high level of loan approvals suggests that household borrowing will remain strong in the coming months. ", " In contrast, business credit has declined slightly over the same period. The general weakness in business credit – notwithstanding considerable volatility in the monthly data which possibly reflects the impact of the new tax system on the seasonal pattern of business borrowing – is consistent with businesses' uncertainty regarding the economic outlook. Business loan approvals also remain at low levels. Lower intermediated borrowings have been only partially offset by solid growth in business funding raised directly through debt and equity markets. While market financing conditions became less favourable in the wake of the US terrorist attacks, causing the postponement of some debt and equity issues, both equity prices and bond yields remain positive for corporate financing. ", " Growth in the broader monetary aggregates has picked up recently: M3 and broad money grew at an annualised rate of 13 and 9 per cent respectively over the six months to September. Growth in the monetary aggregates has outstripped that in credit, as net offshore borrowing by financial institutions – a funding source not included in the monetary aggregates – has slowed. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International                                          and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar has been volatile in recent months but is currently around its average over the past year. The real exchange rate, which adjusts for differences in inflation across countries, is also currently close to its level of a year ago but 15 per cent below its 1990s average. This is likely to provide an ongoing impetus to the traded sector of the economy (Graph 77). ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3 per cent in the September quarter to be 2.5 per cent higher over the year (Graph 78). Inflation measures are now largely unaffected by the direct effect of changes to the tax system, but fluctuations in the price of petrol continue to have a significant influence. Petrol prices fell by over 8 per cent in the September quarter and are 7½per cent lower over the past year. As a result, the decline in petrol prices subtracted almost ½ a percentage point from the latest quarterly and annual rates of inflation. ", " The various measures of underlying inflation were around 0.7 per cent in the September quarter, down from rates of around 0.9 per cent in the March and June quarters (Table 17). Thus, year-ended underlying inflation has risen from 2½ per cent in mid 2000 to around 3 per cent currently. This pick-up largely reflects some flow-through of accumulated upstream price pressures relating to the fall in the exchange rate over the past couple of years and increases in world prices which have flowed through to items such as food. These pressures are evident in the rise in annual growth of the tradables component (excluding petrol) of the CPI from zero at the beginning of 2000, to 3½ per cent over the year to the September quarter (Graph 79). Tradables prices (excluding petrol) are rising faster than non-tradables prices for the first time in six years. ", " In the latest quarter, however, there are signs that some of this pressure may be abating. The tradables component of the CPI, excluding petrol, increased by 0.2 per cent in the September quarter, after rising by around 1½ per cent in each of the two previous quarters. To some extent the reduction in upward pressure on tradables prices reflects a levelling off in the exchange rate since the end of 2000. In import-weighted terms, the exchange rate had fallen by 14 per cent over the previous year and a half. ", " The proportion of tradable items recording price rises in the quarter also declined, having risen sharply in the first half of the year, with large price falls recorded for a number of tradable items. Clothing prices declined by nearly 2½ per cent in the September quarter, continuing the trend of the past year as retailers have sought to run down unwanted inventories. This should ease as inventories return to desired levels. Vegetable prices fell by more than 8 per cent in the quarter, and have now substantially unwound the flood-related rise in the March quarter. The large fall in petrol prices – their steepest decline since the Gulf War – reflected lower crude oil prices and tighter refinery margins. A further fall in the petrol component of the CPI in the December quarter is in prospect if the crude oil price, in Australian dollar terms, remains around its current level (Graph 80). ", " These falls were offset by large rises in the prices of a number of other food items. The price of meat products, in particular, has risen faster over the past year than at any time in the past two decades as a contraction in world supply, due to the outbreaks of livestock diseases, has increased world meat prices. Higher world prices for grain and flour have also led to an increase in the price of cereal products. Prices have risen for dairy products, though for milk this only partially unwinds the large fall in prices experienced in the latter half of 2000. Fruit prices also rose due to supply shortages. ", " In contrast to the moderate outcome for tradables, the price of non-tradable products increased by a little over <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> in the quarter, after recording outcomes of around ½ a per cent in each of the three previous quarters. House purchase prices, which had risen very little in the previous three quarters, rose by just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span> in the September quarter, reflecting the recovery in activity in the housing sector. ", " A number of other non-tradable service prices also rose strongly. Insurance service prices increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.7 per cent</span> in the quarter, and are 7 per cent higher over the past year owing partially to an easing in competitive pressures in the industry. Utility prices, which have generally been stable over the past few years (after excluding the effect of the GST), rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> in the quarter due partly to the cessation of the ‘Winter Power Bonus’ in Victoria, which had reduced household energy bills by $60 over the past three years. Airline ticket prices, as measured in the CPI, are yet to show the impact of recent developments in the airline industry – the demise of Ansett and the reduction in international air travel – as these events occurred late in the quarter. ", " Input cost pressures, after peaking in the second half of 2000, have moderated over the course of 2001, aided by a decline in import prices (Graph 81). Producer price inflation over the past year is now running at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> at all stages of production (Table 18). This is well down on the rates in late 2000, suggesting that inflationary pressure from this source has eased considerably in recent quarters. ", " In the most recent quarter, widespread falls were recorded in the prices of imported goods. The fall in the price of electrical machinery was particularly large, with office equipment prices falling by more than 10 per cent in the September quarter. Oil prices also fell, with the Asian benchmark oil price declining by 9 per cent in the quarter. ", " These falls were offset by price rises for most domestically produced items. The price of food again rose markedly in the September quarter due to higher prices for meat, grain and dairy products. The rate of inflation for domestically manufactured goods (excluding petrol and basic metal products) slowed in the September quarter, but in annual terms it still remains high at 4½ per cent. Increased activity in the housing sector raised the cost of construction output by almost 1 per cent in the September quarter, after declines in each of the past two quarters. Inflation in the property and business services sector continued at a steady pace overall, but with some variation across industries. The cost of computer consultancy services fell by ½ a per cent in the September quarter, reflecting widespread weakness in demand, while fees for legal services rose by 4½ per cent. ", " Some upward pressure on business costs is likely to emanate from the insurance and electricity industries. Businesses are reported to have experienced large increases in commercial insurance premiums in recent quarters, reflecting the withdrawal of some low-cost competitors from the market, lower investment returns for insurance companies and an increase in the number of global catastrophes. While the effect of the terrorist attack on the global insurance industry remains uncertain, the inevitable contraction in the supply of reinsurance suggests that upward pressure on commercial premiums is likely to be maintained in the short term. Businesses are also reporting increases in the price of electricity, particularly at the wholesale level, as some of the large price falls that occurred through the second half of the 1990s are unwound (see <a href=\"#box-e\">Box E</a>). ", " Most major business surveys support the view that inflationary pressures from input cost increases have abated from the pace recorded in 2000. The economy-wide NAB business survey shows that purchase costs increased by 0.6 per cent in the September quarter, their slowest rate for 18 months, with a further slowing expected in the December quarter (Graph 82). Similarly, both the ACCI-Westpac and Australian Industry Group surveys indicate that fewer manufacturers are reporting rising costs than in previous quarters. Business expectations for product price inflation are more mixed, but, in general, fewer firms are expecting to raise prices than at the same time last year. ", " The various measures of wages generally indicate that labour costs remain contained following a modest acceleration in the growth of some of these measures over the course of 2000. The Wage Cost Index (WCI) increased by 3.7 per cent over the year to the June quarter 2001, the same annual rate as in the previous quarter, with similar growth recorded in both the public-sector and private-sector components (Graph 83). This levelling-out in wages growth is consistent with data for new enterprise agreements. The average annualised wage increase in federal enterprise agreements certified in the June quarter was 3.9 per cent, slightly lower than that recorded in the latter part of 2000 (Graph 84). Wage increases under existing federal agreements have remained little changed over the past year and a half at 3.7 per cent. ", " Growth in average weekly ordinary-time earnings (AWOTE) remains firm, rising by 2.2 per cent in the June quarter, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.3 per cent</span> higher than a year ago. The rise in the quarter was well above growth in most other indicators and is likely to reflect compositional problems that beset the Average Weekly Earnings survey. ", " According to the Mercer Cullen Egan Dell (MCED) <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em>, the average annual increase in office workers' wages was little changed in the September quarter at 4.4 per cent, while growth in executive salaries remained around 4¾ per cent. Recent business surveys indicate that wages growth remains contained, with the NAB quarterly business survey reporting that labour costs continued to grow modestly in the September quarter. Both the NAB economy-wide survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported that firms are having little difficulty attracting suitable labour. ", " The Australian Council of Trade Unions announced in late October that it intends to make an application to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) to vary award rates of pay. The claim, which will be heard as part of the Safety Net Review early next year, seeks a $25 per week increase in pay for all award workers. Last year, the AIRC granted increases of between $13 and $17 per week. ", " The inflation expectations of consumers have been relatively steady over the past few quarters after recording strong rises over the year prior to the introduction of the GST (Graph 85). The Melbourne Institute indicates that consumers' median expectation for inflation over the coming year was 4.5 per cent in October, unchanged from September; this series has exceeded the actual rate of inflation throughout most of the past decade. ", " Business expectations for inflation have also remained steady. The NAB business survey indicates that retailers expect to increase prices by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter. Over the medium term, less than one in ten respondents expect inflation to average more than 4 per cent, while one-third of respondents expect inflation to be below 3 per cent. Longer-term inflation expectations of investors, as measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, have fallen over the past three months and are back around the low levels recorded in late 1997 and 1998. ", " Most financial-market economists surveyed by the Bank have revised down their inflation forecasts following the release of the September quarter CPI. The median inflation forecast for the year to June 2002 declined from <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.3 per cent</span> in the August survey, to 2.0 per cent in the latest survey (Table 19). The median inflation forecast for the year to June 2003 was 2.2 per cent. Most respondents' forecasts still incorporate the assumption that over the next couple of years, the exchange rate will appreciate. Trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), have revised down their expectations for inflation over the year to June 2002 in the November survey, unwinding the sharp increase reported in the May survey. Union officials generally expect inflation to remain around 3 per cent over the year to June 2003. ", " After a period in which it was boosted by the rise in the price level associated with the changes to the tax system, CPI inflation was 2½ per cent over the year to September. The various measures of underlying inflation suggest that it has picked up slightly from around 2½ per cent in mid 2000 to around 3 per cent currently. This increase in underlying inflation reflects the pass-through of various cost pressures, in particular those relating to the large decline in the exchange rate over the past couple of years and higher oil prices. ", " Some of these cost pressures appear to have eased in the latest quarter, as reflected in the producer price data and in a number of business surveys. Petrol prices fell sharply in the September quarter, and are lower still in the December quarter. Although the exchange rate has been reasonably stable, import prices (excluding petrol) fell sharply in the September quarter. This may reflect downward pressure on world prices from the deteriorating global outlook. This is already evident in the prices of electronic equipment, but could become more pervasive if global demand remains weak. The ongoing effects of the earlier decline in the exchange rate on prices for tradables would, in most circumstances, be expected to result in quarterly CPI inflation remaining higher than normal in the period immediately ahead, as profit margins on import sales are gradually restored. But it is possible that the process of margin re-building could occur in part by a decline in foreign-currency prices for imports, with less pressure on final prices to the consumer. This outcome appears to be more likely now than was the case <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months ago</span>. ", " There are several industry-specific factors that will work in the opposite direction over the next year or so, placing some upward pressure on business costs. Businesses are already reporting large increases in commercial insurance premiums, which are likely to continue as reinsurance premiums are raised. Wholesale electricity prices are rising, after a period of declining real electricity prices, with some businesses experiencing particularly large price increases for long-term contracts. ", " There are also some industry-specific developments that will affect consumer prices more directly. The rebound in the housing market is already feeding through into increases in house purchase costs and this pressure is likely to intensify in the coming quarters. The recent changes to the structure of the airline industry have put upward pressure on the cost of air travel, though this is not yet evident in the CPI. More generally, competitive pressures have helped cap price rises in the insurance, telecommunications and airline sectors over the past decade. The exit of a number of businesses from these industries in recent months may result in some rise in prices in these areas. ", " Nevertheless, competition remains strong across many sectors, and businesses are likely to find it difficult to raise prices significantly while there remains appreciable spare capacity in the economy. The current subdued state of the labour market, and the prospect that this will persist for some time, means that growth in labour costs should remain well contained and may slow. Together with the general easing in cost pressures, this increases the scope for some margin re-building without strong pressure on consumer prices. ", " The Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation, measured on a year-ended basis, will reach a little over 3 per cent in the next couple of quarters, before declining to around 2½ per cent through 2002. In the near term, CPI inflation is likely to remain below underlying inflation due to the decline in petrol prices. This assessment is based on the usual assumption that the exchange rate remains around recent levels, though international oil prices are assumed to drift slightly higher over the coming year in response to reductions in oil production. ", " Risks to the forecast can be identified in both directions. Inflation could be higher than forecast if the world economy were to recover faster than is currently anticipated, lessening the assumed downward pressure on world prices. The possibility of higher oil prices, given the current military tensions, constitutes another upside risk to the outlook for inflation. A sharp and sustained rise in the price of oil would feed directly into consumer prices, but there would also be an indirect effect through higher business costs. ", " On the other hand, inflation could be lower than forecast if the downturn in the global economy were to be deeper or more protracted than currently assumed. Such a scenario could result from the recession in the US economy being worse than the Consensus forecasts currently imply. In addition to causing larger declines in world prices, the weaker world economy could translate into slower demand growth in Australia and hence, in time, further constrain domestic wage and price increases. Currently, the Bank considers these risks to the central forecast, over a one to two year horizon, to be slightly weighted towards the downside. ", " The service sectors have contributed strongly to economic growth in recent years. During the second half of 2000, in particular, growth in some service industries partially offset the weakness in output in those industries of the economy exposed to the downturn in dwelling construction (Graph A1). More recently, as the recovery of dwelling construction has gained momentum and growth in the goods-related sectors has thus recovered, there are signs that some service industries are slowing. ", " For this analysis the economy has been divided into four groupings, based on whether industries are primarily involved in goods production, goods distribution, supplying services to businesses or supplying services to households. On this basis, the service sectors, which encompass the latter two categories, account for around 45 per cent of total output and employment, about the same as the goods-related sectors <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table A1)</span>. Within the service sectors, services provided to businesses contribute the larger share of output, while those provided to households, which tend to be more labour intensive, account for a larger share of employment. ", " During the past decade, growth in the service sectors has, on average, been greater than that in the goods-related sectors. In the past few years, growth in the business services industries has been particularly rapid, reflecting several factors such as the preparations for Y2K, the new tax system, and, to a lesser extent, the Olympics, as well as the expansion of telecommunications networks following the deregulation of the domestic telecommunications industry. Each of these developments created a large temporary increase in demand for specialist services, especially in the fields of information technology and communications (ITC), accounting and consultancy. The reduction in demand from these sources would have, of itself, contributed to a slowing in activity in the business services sector. It has, however, been exacerbated by the global downturn in ITC activity, and the more general cyclical slowing in growth that has taken place. ", " In recent years, growth in the household services sector has also been relatively strong, underpinned by growth in the health, accommodation, cafes and restaurants, and personal services industries. Over the past year, the resilience of the household services sector has been due mainly to the continued strength in demand for health services, with an easing in demand being recorded in many of the other major components. As discussed in the section on household consumption, the strength in demand for health services appears to be largely because of federal government incentives to take up private health insurance. ", " The disparate performances of the business and household service sectors has been reflected in the labour market. Business services employment is now lower than a year ago, the first such annual decline recorded since the early 1990s (Graph A2). Employment in household services, on the other hand, continues to grow relatively strongly. ", " A continuation of the slowing in business services output is in prospect, with job vacancies falling sharply across a range of job types in the sector (Graph A3). This includes falls in vacancies in areas where special factors are no longer supporting demand – such as in ITC and accounting. However, falls are also evident in areas of the business services sector that are most exposed to changes in discretionary spending by firms, such as marketing and advertising. ", " While services supplied to households have recently been supportive of growth, their growth is also likely to slow. The potential for further strong growth in health services, for example, could be limited as coverage by private health insurance reaches saturation levels. The recent reduction in domestic and international airline travel will also have reduced demand for tourist-oriented services during the second half of 2001. ", " Tourism makes a significant contribution to economic activity in Australia and to Australia's exports. While measuring the size of the tourism industry is quite difficult, the ABS has estimated that in 1997/98, the tourism industry accounted for 4.5 per cent of GDP (Table B1). This implies that it is roughly similar in size to the education and mining industries. Over three-quarters of tourism output is consumed by domestic tourists, who mainly comprise households but also include businesses and government.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " Many parts of the economy are involved in the provision of goods and services to tourists. Around two-thirds of tourism output, however, is contributed by the transport and storage, accommodation, cafes and restaurants, and retail and wholesale trade industries (Table B2). The transport and storage industry makes the largest contribution to tourism output, principally due to the use of air travel by both domestic and international tourists. The accommodation, cafes and restaurants industry, however, is the most tourism dependent, with around 36 per cent of its output directly attributable to the tourism industry. ", " The tourism industry is highly export oriented, contributing around 11 per cent of Australia's total export earnings even though it accounts for only 4.5 per cent of output (Graph B1). In part, this reflects the different characteristics of the international and domestic tourist markets. Although the high share of business tourists among domestic tourists implies that the average domestic tourist tends to spend much more per night than the average international tourist, over the course of their stay, the average international tourist spends considerably more (Table B3). This in turn probably reflects the fact that the average short-stay international tourist is relatively high spending, while there are also a significant number of international tourists (for example, backpackers) who, although not wealthy, spend a considerable amount because of the length of their stay. ", " The collapse of Ansett and the US terrorist attacks were associated with a sharp fall in airline travel. Given that air transport makes a large direct contribution to the output of the tourism industry and facilitates tourism more generally, the recent downturn in airline travel has had a significant and immediate effect on the tourism industry. ", " Ansett accounted for approximately 40 per cent of the domestic aviation market (both passenger and freight) and around 3½ per cent of international passenger movements to and from Australia. There has been a sizeable decline in domestic air services in the past couple of months, although liaison suggests that it has been much less than during the pilots' strike of 1989 (Graph B2). The magnitude of the fall in international passenger movements is hard to establish, although the Tourism Forecasting Council has revised down its forecast for overseas arrivals in the December quarter by around 15 per cent. ", " The effect on aggregate output in the economy of these developments is dependent on a number of factors. Most importantly, it depends on the initial size of the contraction in the tourism industry, and the extent to which domestic consumers substitute spending on other goods or services for the spending they would otherwise have directed towards tourist activities (both domestically and internationally). Secondly, it depends on the flow-on effects of these developments to other industries. Finally, it depends on the time it takes before both the capacity of the domestic airline industry is restored to satisfy demand and international tourism recovers. ", " It will be difficult to predict the relative sizes of these effects with any accuracy. Around 17 per cent of domestic tourists use airline travel as their main mode of transport, although much higher figures are recorded for the Northern Territory and Tasmania (Graph B3). The variation in these figures across states reflects both the feasibility and accessibility of alternative modes of transport and differing shares of interstate tourists. Overall, however, these data illustrate that a large proportion of domestic tourists are not reliant on air transport, and they suggest that there may be some scope for substitution as, for example, domestic tourists choose holiday destinations to which they can drive rather than fly. If Australia benefits from a safe-haven status, it could also encourage the replacement of overseas travel with domestic travel and attract international tourists from other destinations. The latter factors appear to have played a role during the Gulf War, and the former during the pilots' strike. In both cases, aggregate economic activity was little affected by the significant shocks to airline travel that occurred. ", " However, there are also forces that may inhibit the recovery of tourism and so generate more pervasive effects on economic activity. The weakened financial position of creditors to Ansett, particularly small businesses, may inhibit spending. Heightened concerns about flying could also imply that it takes longer before the demand for tourist-related activities recovers. More generally, given that tourist expenditures are to some extent discretionary, and given the tourism industry's reliance on exports, it may be more exposed than most industries to any further deterioration in domestic and global prospects. ", " Central banks around the world sharply increased the supply of liquidity to their financial institutions in the aftermath of 11 September, to ensure that financial systems continued to operate without disruption. This box explains what that meant in the Australian context. ", " Broadly speaking, the ‘liquidity’ of an institution refers to its capacity to meet short-term financial obligations. In the case of banks, the core part of their liquidity is the current balances held with the central bank. Banks can draw on these at any time and receive instant value. In Australia, banks' funds at the RBA are held in Exchange Settlement (ES) accounts. ", " The supply of ES funds is controlled by the RBA through daily operations in the money market. The RBA varies the supply of ES funds so as to influence the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend funds to each other. This interest rate, known as the cash rate, is the rate in terms of which monetary policy changes are announced. When the RBA wishes to add funds to the banking system, it purchases securities, giving the seller funds in exchange. Sales of securities by the RBA reduce the supply of ES funds. ", " Banks' demand for ES funds is normally fairly stable, being based on their expected payment flows. Demand for ES funds can increase substantially, however, in times of uncertainty as banks are less confident about their payment flows and, as a precaution, seek to increase their holdings of liquid balances. Hence, one of the RBA's priorities on the morning of 12 September was to ensure that there were sufficient funds to meet banks' demand, in order to avoid disruption to markets and increases in interest rates. When markets opened in Australia on the morning of 12 September, the RBA issued a statement that payments and settlement systems were operating normally and that it would provide the financial system with liquidity as needed. ", " Early indications pointed to a sharp increase in the demand for liquidity on the day. Banks expecting to receive payments arising from international transactions were uncertain whether those payments would be received. As a result, they became less willing to lend funds themselves. ", " The RBA injected significant additional ES funds through its market operations on 12 September. In its normal dealing round (which takes place between 10 and 10.15 am) the RBA boosted the supply of funds to about $2.5 billion, or around three times the amount banks typically hold. The RBA normally only deals once a day but, on this occasion, it undertook a second round of market operations to add further funds later in the day when it was possible to form a clearer view on the demand for funds. This boosted the amount of funds that banks held in their ES accounts at the end of the day to over $5 billion (Graph C1). ", " The demand for ES funds remained unusually high for a few days subsequently, with balances averaging about $3 billion over the week. By late September, normal conditions had returned to the market. ", " The increased supply of liquidity allowed the money market to continue to operate smoothly throughout the period, with the cash rate remaining very close to the target (Graph C2). ", " Despite the weakness in the US share market over the past 18 months or so, US share prices have, on average, risen faster than those in Australia over the past decade (Graph D1). Since end 1989, the increase in the S&amp;P 500 index has exceeded that in the ASX 200 by an average annual rate of 3.8 per cent. Many factors have influenced these outcomes. Amongst them are the low dividend payout ratio and the high level of share buy backs in the US. ", " Dividends are very much a part of the return to shareholders and should be included in any assessment of relative returns. Since end 1989, the Australian ASX 200 Accumulation Index, which takes into account dividends, has recorded an annual compound rise of 10 per cent, compared with 12 per cent for the S&amp;P 500 accumulation index (Table D1). This margin is substantially narrower than that in the respective price indices. ", " The narrower margin between the US and Australian accumulation indices is due to higher dividend payments in Australia. Australia's dividend yield has averaged 4 per cent since end 1989, around double that of the US. This higher yield reflects a higher dividend payout ratio (around 80 per cent), which was encouraged by the introduction of dividend imputation in 1987. The earlier downward trend in the payout ratio has been largely reversed since (Graph D2). In contrast, the US dividend payout ratio has fallen sharply since the early 1990s, to now stand at about 40 per cent. ", " The effects of share buy backs on returns are more difficult to assess. In theory, it can be argued that share buy backs should not affect the price of a company's shares. To buy back its own shares a company must spend funds that it would otherwise have used to generate future income. A buy back, therefore, reduces a company's market value. But the number of shares outstanding is reduced by the same proportion, leaving the price per share unchanged. ", " On the other hand, empirical studies investigating buy backs in the US market find that buy backs lead to both a short-term price increase and longer-term market out-performance. In any event it should also be noted that, even if a buy back does not directly affect a company's share price, the share price will nonetheless be higher than if the company had paid an equivalent amount in dividends. A payment of dividends reduces the value of the firm but does not change the number of shares outstanding. ", " Total buy backs for the US equity market in the five years ending December 2000 amounted to over US$1 trillion, or 7 per cent of current domestic capitalisation. Australian share buy backs totalled A$28 billion over the same period, or 4 per cent of market capitalisation. ", " As a result of the high level of buy backs, the US equity market has recorded only four significant quarters of positive net equity raisings since 1995 (Graph D3). In comparison, Australia has had only one quarter of net buy backs in that period. The high rate of buy backs in the US has meant that US net equity raisings have averaged – 0.15 per cent of total market capitalisation since 1995, compared with an equivalent figure of 0.5 per cent for Australia. ", " In the US, both the non-financial and financial sectors have run down their equity stock over the last five years. Net raisings by the non-financial and financial sectors amounted to US$–761 billion and US$–93 billion respectively. The only sector to record positive net equity issuance has been foreign corporates, which made net raisings of US$456 billion. The use of buy backs in Australia has generally been modest, though significant use of them was made by financial institutions. ", " The electricity industry in Australia has changed substantially over the past decade. A range of administrative reforms and the introduction of competition to parts of the industry have been associated with significant productivity gains and, for much of the period, declining real electricity prices. However, in recent months there has been upward pressure on electricity prices, with some customers experiencing particularly large price increases. ", " Reforms implemented over the past decade have resulted in the separation of the components of electricity supply – generation, transmission, distribution, and retail supply. Competition was introduced into the generation of electricity by dividing the power stations into separate corporate entities, initially in Victoria and NSW and later in other states. Competition has also been introduced to parts of the retail electricity market. At this stage, large and some medium-sized users of electricity in most states have the choice of retail supplier – that is, in the parlance of the industry, users are deemed to be ‘contestable’. All users in NSW and Victoria are expected to be able to choose their electricity retailer next year. South Australia plans to adopt full retail contestability later than in these states, while Queensland has decided not to proceed. ", " Another key development was the establishment in December 1998 of the National Electricity Market (NEM), which connected the individual electricity grids of NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> It allows the transmission of electricity across these regions' borders. ", " Movements in final electricity prices can largely be traced to two components: an<em>energy</em> charge which mainly reflects movements in wholesale electricity prices, and <em>network</em> charges levied on electricity retailers by electricity distributors, reflecting the costs of building and maintaining the electricity distribution and transmission network. As a rough guide, for medium-sized businesses the energy charge comprises at least 50 per cent of the final electricity price. ", " The reforms in the electricity industry were associated with a decline in electricity prices faced by businesses and a slowing in the growth of electricity prices faced by households (Graph E1). Large and medium-sized businesses in Victoria and NSW who were contestable benefited from falls in electricity prices during 1996–1998, underpinned by the low wholesale price of electricity as generators competed for market share <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table E1)</span> and, more recently, falling network charges. Businesses in South Australia also experienced lower prices in this period. However, over the past few years, wholesale prices have risen which, along with expected smaller future reductions in network charges, have been feeding through to higher final electricity prices as businesses in these states renegotiate their electricity contracts. ", " In South Australia, where many additional business users have just become contestable, electricity prices are increasing substantially. This partly reflects the artificially low prices contained in their previously regulated contracts, but also a perceived increased risk that tighter supply of electricity in the summer months may cause large spikes in wholesale electricity prices, as occurred last summer (Graph E2). ", " In contrast to larger businesses, the supply of electricity to households and smaller businesses is only now becoming contestable in NSW and Victoria. In Victoria, the government has reserved the right to oversee the setting of electricity prices in that state. In NSW, households have the option until mid 2004 of remaining on (or returning to) a regulated contract which limits the price rise to that of the total CPI. In South Australia and Queensland, price rises of around 3 per cent have been determined for 2001/02. ", " Electricity prices affect the CPI directly through households' consumption of electricity, and indirectly as changes in input costs faced by businesses are passed on to prices of other goods and services. Electricity has a weight of 1.8 per cent in the CPI and, in the near term, as the majority of households will be covered by regulated contracts containing subdued price increases, the direct effect on inflation will be fairly small. Although electricity comprises less than 2 per cent of total intermediate inputs used in production, it accounts for much more in selected industries – electricity comprises up to 8 per cent of intermediate inputs in parts of the manufacturing industry. The size of recent price increases for some businesses will have a significant effect on their overall costs and may feed through to consumer prices.

Real GDP increased at an annual rate of 4 per cent over the first three quarters of 2001, and indications to date suggest growth continued at a good pace in the December quarter. The relatively strong performance of the Australian economy during the current global downturn has reflected, at least in part, an absence of the structural imbalances which have been associated with cyclical downturns in the Australian economy in the past. For example, with the level of business investment quite moderate, there has been no accumulation of widespread over-capacity such as had occurred in some previous cycles. In addition, wage and inflationary pressures have remained contained, which allowed domestic policy settings to be eased last year to support growth in the face of the contractionary effects of the world recession. ", " Nevertheless, there are clear signs that the world growth slowdown is affecting the Australian economy. After a period where the external sector had made a substantial contribution to output growth, it reduced growth in the second half of 2001, as demand fell in most of Australia's major export markets. The synchronised nature of the current international slowdown has limited the scope for Australia's exporters to divert sales to other markets, although the low level of the exchange rate has continued to help exporters. A factor assisting the Australian economy over recent years has been the favourable trend in the terms of trade. Australia's commodity prices have increased in foreign-currency terms and, even more so, in terms of Australian dollars, since their trough in 1999, providing a significant boost to export incomes over much of that period. ", " While the world recession has reduced the volume of exports, domestic demand has strengthened. Household spending has continued to grow at a solid pace, despite a subdued labour market, and consumer confidence in recent months has been high. Further increases in household wealth, together with moderate increases in incomes and the boost to spending power from lower petrol prices and interest rates, have underpinned the growth in consumption. As long as the labour market remains relatively weak, however, there is some risk that consumption growth may moderate in the period ahead. ", " The rebound in the housing sector provided a boost to growth over the second half of 2001, although even abstracting from the contribution of that sector, the economy has been expanding at a solid pace. Forward indicators of housing activity indicate that this boost to growth is likely to fade in the second half of 2002 and activity in the sector may even decline, though the size of any downturn should be significantly smaller than that experienced in the second half of 2000. ", " There is some prospect that the effect of any slowdown in the housing sector on domestic demand will be counterbalanced by a pick-up in business investment. Activity in the non-residential construction sector is clearly picking up after remaining subdued for the past couple of years, boosted by a number of large infrastructure projects. Surveys of business confidence suggest that it has rebounded from its post-September lows, and indicators of investment intentions are pointing to a pick-up in investment in some sectors, most notably mining. Should the international outlook improve in coming months, a more broad-based pick-up in investment and hiring intentions may become evident. ", " Over the past few months, there have been a number of indications of a more positive outlook for the world economy. This is particularly the case in the United States, but there are also signs of recovery in a number of <span class=\"no-wrap\">east Asian countries</span>. The US national accounts reported marginally positive growth in the December quarter, a stronger result than most had expected. Consumer and business sentiment have improved from their post-September lows and businesses have been able to clear at least some of their excess inventories. There has also been some recovery in sentiment evident in Europe. The information and technology sector, which had been an important contributing factor in the initial stages of the global downturn, is showing signs of stabilisation with ITC equipment spending edging slightly higher in the US and a pick-up in production in some east Asian countries. ", " Against this background, the downgrades to international growth forecasts that had continued throughout 2001 appear to have ceased, and most observers expect a recovery in the global economy to get under way during the course of 2002, underpinned by the expansionary policy settings now in place. Nevertheless, at this stage it appears that such a recovery is likely to be modest, and would still imply a substantial degree of excess capacity for some time ahead. While the US economy appears to have stabilised, existing imbalances may constrain the strength of its recovery for some time. The most significant risk to a sustained recovery in the world economy may lie with Japan, where there is some possibility that the economy could deteriorate sharply in 2002. Continued weakness in the Japanese economy may limit the recovery in other Asian countries. ", " The improving world outlook has been reflected in a number of ways in financial markets: expectations of further monetary easing have been scaled back sharply in most countries; longer-term interest rates have risen; credit spreads on corporate debt have narrowed again; and share markets have recovered strongly from their post-September lows. These features have been common to all major countries, with the exception of Japan where markets remain gloomy about the economic outlook. Conditions in emerging markets have also generally improved recently; the default by Argentina on its sovereign debt and its subsequent devaluation did not spill over into adverse consequences for other markets. ", " The improvement in economic prospects has meant that recent high-profile corporate collapses in the US have had a limited impact on markets. Nonetheless, there is a feeling of wariness in markets about the possibility of more negative surprises, which has led to falls in share prices. There has also been a lot of questioning of the adequacy of accounting and corporate governance arrangements. ", " In Australia, signs of increased confidence in financial markets have, in many respects, been more pronounced than in other countries because of the continuing relatively good growth of the Australian economy. This relative economic strength has been reflected most clearly in the performance of the domestic share market, which remains close to its peak; markets in other countries are generally down 20–30 per cent from their early 2000 levels. There has been a resumption of portfolio equity flows into Australia from abroad, after a period in 2000 when such investment had largely ceased. Together with increased inflows into <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar bonds</span> (particularly by Japanese retail investors), this has helped to steady the exchange rate over most of the past year, after the sharp fall that occurred during 2000 and early 2001. ", " Underlying inflation in the December quarter was broadly in line with the outlook presented in the November <em>Statement</em>, which had indicated that inflation would exceed the target for a temporary period before declining to around the middle of the target range. In the quarter, the CPI was boosted by sharp increases in the prices of a number of items, particularly some food products, which are likely to be relatively transient. Working in the other direction, the CPI was reduced by declining petrol prices. Both the CPI and underlying measures show inflation on a gradual upward trend over the past few years, with the underlying measures picking up from a little below <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in 1999 to around 3¼ per cent currently. This pick-up has reflected a rebuilding of margins in response to the depreciation of the exchange rate and other cost pressures, including the rise in petrol prices that occurred during 2000. ", " These factors are unlikely to result in an inflation rate which stays above the target for an unacceptable time. The exchange rate has been relatively stable since early 2001 in trade-weighted terms. Hence, while the earlier depreciation has clearly placed upward pressure on prices in the tradables sector, the effect on the rate of inflation can be expected to diminish over time. The growth of wage costs remains moderate, and productivity growth appears to have returned to the strong pace evident over the second half of the 1990s, after a cyclical slowdown in 2000. These trends point to growth of unit labour costs at a rate consistent with attainment of the inflation target in the medium term. Moreover, with inflation expectations firmly anchored, and labour market conditions relatively subdued at present, there is little likelihood that wage pressures will increase in the period ahead. ", " Of a more immediate nature, the fall in petrol prices over the past year has eased cost pressures on business, although some cost pressures still remain including rising insurance premiums and electricity charges. Indicators of upstream price pressures have also been suggesting slower overall growth in input costs in recent quarters. Given all these factors, the Bank's assessment is that inflation is currently at or near its peak and that it will decline to around the middle of the target over the year ahead, both in terms of the CPI and in underlying terms. The assessment as to underlying inflation is broadly the same as that presented in the November <em>Statement</em>, although the risks around this outlook now appear more evenly balanced, rather than being weighted to the downside. ", " The stance of monetary policy was progressively eased over the course of 2001 as the extent of the slowdown in world growth became apparent. This easing continued in December, when the cash rate was reduced to its lowest level in almost 30 years, bringing the cumulative reduction in the cash rate to 200 basis points. As a result of these reductions over the past year, policy settings are now clearly expansionary and supporting growth in the domestic economy. ", " At its February meeting, in view of the recent changes in the balance of risks for the global economy and for domestic inflation, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged. While the global economy remains weak at present, there have been a number of more promising signs in recent months. In the final months of 2001, the main risks to the world outlook were clearly on the downside, with consequent risks for the Australian economy. In recent months these risks appear to have lessened, as confidence around the world has improved and signs of stabilisation have emerged. Hence, while a significant global recovery in 2002 is not yet assured, it does appear more likely than was the case a few months ago. Downside risks to the global economy include the fragility of the Japanese economy and the possibility that more adverse news could emerge in coming months about the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US corporate sector</span>. On the other hand, the stimulatory policy settings now in place in the major countries may engender a stronger recovery than currently envisaged. All of this will have important implications for Australia, since a solid global recovery would clearly make it easier for the Australian economy to maintain its recent strength. As always, the Bank will continue to assess these medium-term developments with a view to promoting sustainable growth consistent with the inflation target. ", " The world economy slowed through 2001, with growth for the year expected to be about half the pace recorded in 2000 (Graph 1). GDP is likely to have contracted in Japan, the US, Germany and several <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian countries</span> in the second half of the year. While the terrorist attacks in the US complicated the analysis of much of the economic data in the latter part of the year, in recent months signs of improving conditions have emerged in the US and some Asian economies, though prospects remain bleak in Japan. There are some indications that demand is stabilising in the information technology and communications (ITC) sector, which has been a major source of weakness in the current downturn, with semiconductor sales and ITC production in parts of Asia picking up recently. ", " The IMF forecasts released in December project only a gradual recovery in 2002 with world growth forecast to remain at just under 2½ per cent, although they do imply a noticeable pick-up in growth over the course of 2002. If realised, these forecasts would result in the weakest two consecutive years of growth since the mid 1970s for the G7 countries and for Australia's major trading partners. ", " The widespread easing of monetary policy and, in a number of countries, fiscal policy in 2001 should support growth in coming months, and lower oil prices will be beneficial for growth in the industrialised countries and much of Asia. There is some chance that the stimulus from these sources will result in higher-than-expected growth, but there remain significant risks to the world outlook on the downside, although less so than in recent months. Financial imbalances and possibly excessive investment continue to pose a threat to the speed of the US recovery, and significant risks surround the outlook for Japan, with the possibility of adverse developments there jeopardising recovery in the rest of Asia. ", " The US economy contracted over the second half of 2001, with output in the December quarter 0.3 per cent lower than the June quarter level (Graph 2). In the December quarter, strong growth in consumption and public spending was almost fully offset by another large rundown in inventories and a further decline in business investment (Table 1). Business investment has contracted for four consecutive quarters to be 9 per cent lower over 2001, with expenditure on equipment and buildings and structures declining at a similar rate. ", " Private consumption held up reasonably well in 2001, as continued robust growth in wages and the boost to spending power from home equity accessed through mortgage refinancing offset the effects of the deterioration in the labour market. In the December quarter, it received an additional boost from strong growth in motor vehicle sales in response to zero-interest financing provided to purchasers by vehicle manufacturers. Abstracting from motor vehicle sales, household spending still increased by 0.4 per cent in the quarter. The unemployment rate reached a six-year high of 5.8 per cent late in 2001 (Graph 3) and claims for unemployment benefits and the level of job advertisements suggest little improvement in the near term, although these indicators appear to have stabilised recently. ", " Strong growth in sales of motor vehicles helped to reduce inventory levels in that sector and there are also indications that the inventory correction may be nearing its end in other areas, particularly in ITC inventories, which have declined to levels last seen in 1995. ITC shipments have also stabilised and new orders for ITC equipment have recorded three consecutive months of increase. These developments contributed to an improvement in the Institute of Supply Management (ISM, formerly the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM)) measure of manufacturing sentiment. Nevertheless, manufacturing production continued to decline through the December quarter, although at a slower rate than earlier in the year. ", " Lower energy prices have underpinned a reduction in consumer price inflation to 1½ per cent over the year to December (Graph 4). However, the core measure of inflation has remained around 2¾ per cent as rises in services prices – particularly for medical care, transport and housing – offset declining goods prices. The weakening in the labour market has not yet caused any significant decline in wages growth, which remained around 4 per cent over the year to December. ", " In response to the economic softness and the continuing downside risks to the US outlook, the US Federal Reserve eased monetary policy by 25 basis points in December, bringing the cumulative easing in this interest-rate cycle to 475 basis points. However, in response to signs of a turning point in the economy and in light of the already stimulatory stance of monetary policy, the Fed left rates unchanged at its January meeting. Fiscal policy also provided some stimulus in the second half of 2001, in the form of income tax cuts, emergency relief following the terrorist attacks and expenditure related to the war on terrorism. ", " Continuing economic and political turmoil in Argentina culminated with the government defaulting on its debt and the abandonment of the decade-long currency board. Subsequently the peso has depreciated sharply. (Further details are provided in the ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International and    Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’ chapter.) Other economies in Latin America have suffered from the slowdown in world growth, particularly Mexico, but to date, there is little evidence of contagion from the events in Argentina. ", " The Japanese economy contracted again in the September quarter and indications are that the economy remained weak in the December quarter (Graph 5). Over the year to September, Japanese GDP fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">½ per cent</span>, due largely to a decline in exports of nearly 10 per cent and a decrease in consumption. ", " Further falls in manufacturing production contributed to another shift down in the overall business activity indicator in the latter part of 2001. The weakness in the manufacturing sector has been broad-based, with ITC manufacturing output and export volumes both over 30 per cent below late-2000 levels, and non-ITC manufacturing output is well below Asian-crisis levels. The contraction in manufacturing output through the second half of 2001 has been reflected in weak investment and employment outcomes (Table 2). In the rest of the economy, sentiment, profits and orders of machinery have been more resilient, but employment in December was still no higher than a year earlier. ", " The deterioration in the labour market has seen the unemployment rate reach a record high of 5.6 per cent in December. This, together with falling wages, has contributed to weakness in incomes and hence consumption. Consumer prices have continued to fall, with the core measure of deflation around ¾ per cent over the year to December 2001. ", " In line with its pledge to limit new bond issuance to 30 trillion yen, the government sees little or no scope for further fiscal stimulus. Initial budget plans for fiscal year 2002 suggest a reduction in general spending of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¼ per cent</span>. With no latitude for official interest rates to be reduced, the Bank of Japan has responded to the deteriorating circumstances by implementing measures designed to boost the level of settlement funds held by the banking system, including the purchase of Japanese government bonds. ", " The downturn in world growth through 2001 has had a marked effect on growth in non-Japan Asia, although the impact across countries has been far from uniform (Table 3). Most countries have experienced large declines in exports, greater than that which occurred during the Asian crisis, with the largest falls occurring in those countries with a high concentration of semiconductors and other ITC products, notably Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia. These four countries have also experienced declines in domestic demand, reflecting weak business investment and rising unemployment. Korea is an exception; despite being a large ITC producer, it experienced robust growth in the latter part of 2001 reflecting a pick-up in public spending and strong growth in consumption. Relatively robust rates of GDP growth were also recorded in China, Indonesia and the Philippines in 2001. ", " The manufacturing sector in non-Japan Asia has borne the brunt of the slowdown, with output declining by a similar amount to that experienced during the Asian crisis. There was a small increase in manufacturing output in the September quarter, with industrial production data indicating further gains in the December quarter in the major ITC-producing countries, mostly driven by a pick-up in ITC goods production. In contrast to the Asian crisis, the services sector, while slowing, has continued to grow over the past year, and there has been little change in output in the construction sector which had collapsed during the Asian crisis (Graph 6). ", " Inflation has declined in most non-Japan Asian economies, due to falling demand and lower oil prices, with China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan recording price falls in year-ended terms. Reflecting the weakness in economic activity and subdued inflation, monetary policy was eased further in recent months in the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. ", " Following robust growth in the June quarter, GDP grew only marginally in the September quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> higher over the year. The weaker growth reflected a decline in exports, and particularly tourism, which accounts for around 5 per cent of GDP. Consumer spending has remained relatively robust with steady employment growth and wage increases contributing to growth in household incomes. Inflation fell to <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.8 per cent</span> in the December quarter after a period at the upper end of the RBNZ's target band. The RBNZ reduced the official cash rate by a further 50 basis points in November to 4.75 per cent. ", " Conditions across the euro area weakened in the second half of 2001, with GDP increasing only slightly in the September quarter, reflecting a slowing in private consumption growth and a rundown in inventories. Output contracted in Germany in the September quarter – mostly due to a decline in investment which was around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> lower over the year – whereas GDP increased by around ½ per cent in France. Activity appears to have remained subdued in the December quarter, with manufacturing production falling further, particularly in Germany and Italy. ", " The labour market has weakened across the euro area since the middle of the year, with employment growth slowing in all major countries and unemployment rates plateauing after falling over the first part of 2001. Lower oil prices resulted in inflation falling from 3½ per cent over the year to May to 2½ per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year to January (Graph 7)</span>. However, the core measure of inflation drifted higher to be 2.3 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year to December</span>. ", " Growth in the UK continued to be stronger than in the euro area over the second half of 2001, but there has been a marked dichotomy between the manufacturing sector and the rest of the economy. Manufacturing output was around 5 per cent lower in the December quarter than a year earlier, while the service sector has expanded by around 3½ per cent over the same period. Inflationary pressures have also eased in the UK, with consumer prices excluding mortgage interest payments increasing by 1.9 per cent over the year to December. ", " While there have been some further reductions in official interest rates in developed countries in recent months, the cycle of global monetary easing that began in January 2001 could be nearing an end. Measured in terms of the number of central banks changing policy, the easing process gathered momentum through the first five months of 2001, paused around the middle of the year, and then resumed. Central bank activity peaked in September when all major central banks eased monetary policy, but it had already picked up in August, ahead of the terrorist attacks, as the outlook for economic activity in many countries had already started to deteriorate by then (Table 4). By December, the number of central banks easing had slowed to three, while in January 2002, only one central bank eased. ", " Perhaps most significantly, the US Fed left interest rates unchanged at its end-January meeting after having cut interest rates at every policy meeting in 2001, as well as on three occasions between meetings. In total, the target rate for Fed funds has been reduced by 475 basis points, to 1.75 per cent, its lowest level since the early 1960s and 125 basis points below the low point seen in the early-1990s recession (Graph 8). In real terms, the Fed Funds rate is near zero (using the core personal consumption expenditure deflator) <span class=\"no-wrap\">or negative (using the core CPI as a deflator)</span>. On both measures, it is close to the lows reached in the early 1990s. ", " With the current level of the Fed funds rate unusually low, and financial markets becoming more optimistic about the US economic outlook, markets have turned their focus to the question of when a tightening in US policy might occur. The futures market is pricing-in the likelihood that monetary tightening will begin around the middle of this year. ", " After the Fed, the largest cumulative cut since the start of 2001 has been by the Bank of Canada, which has cut its overnight cash rate by 375 basis points to 2.0 per cent. After that came the Bank of England and the RBA, both of which cut rates by 200 basis points during 2001, followed by New Zealand and Switzerland, which cut rates by 175 points, and the ECB, which cut rates by 150 points (Table 5). ", " The Bank of Japan (BoJ), having earlier reduced rates to zero, continued to direct its monetary policy to boosting banks' reserves. When its reserve-targeting policy was first announced in March 2001, the target was <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 trillion</span> yen, which was around 20 per cent above the reserve holdings over the previous year. Subsequently, the BoJ has several times increased the target, and it now stands at 10–15 trillion yen. The Bank of Japan has in fact pushed reserves above target levels in recent months. ", " Several other central banks in Asia have eased monetary policy a little further over recent months. Short-term interest rates in Asia (with the exception of Indonesia and the Philippines) are currently in the range of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 to 5 per cent</span>, whereas a year ago they had been in the range of 3 to 7 per cent. As in the major countries, the current level of interest rates in these countries is very low by historical standards (Graph 9). ", " Short-term interest rates in other emerging markets have generally been steady with the exception of Argentina where interest rates have risen sharply as the financial crisis deepened. Short-term interest rates on peso deposits in Argentina fluctuated between 50 and 120 per cent in the months leading up to the formal default on sovereign debt in December. Since then, controls on bank deposits have prevented the normal operation of the banking system. ", " Long bond yields around the world have increased significantly over recent months. Yields on US government 10-year debt, after falling to as low as 4.2 per cent in early November, have since risen by around 80 basis points to around 5 per cent. This is the same as their level a year earlier, before the Fed started easing, though still <span class=\"no-wrap\">150 points</span> below their peak in early 2000 (Graph 10). The recent increase was mainly due to improved confidence among market participants about an early recovery in the US economy, although it may also have reflected the significant deterioration in the US's fiscal position that also occurred at the same time. ", " The improved US economic outlook is also evident in the corporate bond market, where credit spreads have moderated noticeably (Graph 11). This has been most apparent in the spread between riskier classes of <span class=\"no-wrap\">fixed-income debt</span> and government securities. The spread on ‘junk’ bonds (i.e. yields on non-investment grade securities above US Treasuries) has fallen by 300 basis points since its peak in early November, to the lowest level seen since May 2000. ", " The rise in long-term yields has meant that the yield curve in the US has steepened noticeably; 10-year US government bond yields are now trading at 330 basis points above the Fed funds target, similar to the reading in the early 1990s (Graph 12). This wide gap indicates that monetary conditions in the US are highly accommodative at present. ", " In European bond markets, yields have followed a similar but more subdued pattern than that seen in the US; yields on German 10-year Government bonds have increased by 60 basis points from their November trough, to around 4.85 per cent. This is around the same level as US yields. During the late 1990s the differential in yields between these two countries had averaged about 100 points. The closing of this gap over the past year has mirrored the closing in the growth differential between the US and Germany that had also been apparent in those earlier years. ", " Yields on Japanese government bonds have been at the top of the band in which they have traded over the past year or so, rising about 1.5 per cent in early February. The rise reflected concerns that ratings agencies would further downgrade Japan's sovereign credit rating. ", " In the months leading up to the default by Argentina, yields on its sovereign debt increased significantly, with the spread to US Treasuries peaking at over 3,000 basis points, effectively ending the government's ability to rollover maturing debt. There has to-date been very little contagion from these events to other emerging market economies. In fact, despite the troubles in Argentina, spreads between both emerging European and Asian sovereign debt and US Treasuries have narrowed by around 210 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, since the end of October (Graph 13). ", " After falling rapidly in the weeks following September 11, equity markets rallied strongly over October, November and December. Initially, this was due to the abatement of the extreme uncertainty that followed the September events, but the rise was sustained by growing expectations that the US economic recovery would start in 2002. This view remains, though concerns that the US company reporting season now underway would produce disappointing earnings, as well as several high profile bankruptcies which have led to some questioning of the earnings measures used by companies, have caused share prices to retrace somewhat in January. In the US, the Wilshire Index, the broadest measure of US share prices (accounting for over 90 per cent of listed companies) is 14 per cent above its 21 September trough, but down 7 per cent from its early January 2002 peak (Graph 14). Likewise the NASDAQ is up 27 per cent from its September trough, but is down 12 from its early January peak. Despite the recent gains, the Wilshire remains 31 per cent below its peak in March 2000, while the NASDAQ remains down 64 per cent. ", " The recent rally in share prices appears to be anticipating a large increase in company earnings in the year ahead. The latest available data on actual earnings, however, still show a very weak picture. Profits announced by S&amp;P 500 companies in aggregate were down by between 33 per cent and 61 per cent in the year to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">September quarter</span>, depending on the measure used. Earnings announcements by companies have become difficult to follow because of the range of measures announced by each company (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). The National Income and Product Accounts measure of non-financial corporate profitability, which provides a consistent series, fell 22 per cent in the year to the September quarter (the latest data available). This is the largest one-year fall in at least 50 years. As a share of GDP, non-financial corporate profits fell to 7.5 per cent in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">September quarter                                        – the lowest</span> level seen since December 1982 (Graph 15). ", " As has usually been the case over recent years, share prices in other countries – with the exception of <span class=\"no-wrap\">Japan – have generally</span> followed those in the US. The Euro STOXX index (a broad index of 310 major euro area companies) has risen 22 per cent since its September trough while the FTSE 100 is now 14 per cent up from its trough. However, as in the US, both these markets remain well down from their 2000 peaks – the euro STOXX by 37 per cent and the FTSE 100 by 27 per cent (Table 6). ", " In Japan, shares have been weak. There has not been the strong recovery from the September trough seen in other countries, with the Topix Index continuing to fall over recent months, touching levels not seen since 1985. The very weak state of the economy and investor concerns about the health of the Japanese financial system have been the reasons for this weakness in share prices. Japanese share prices are now only around one-third of their peak level in 1990. ", " In aggregate, equity prices in emerging Asia have appreciated strongly over recent months, and are now <span class=\"no-wrap\">29 per cent</span> higher than their late-September trough (Graph 16). Markets are hoping that the expected recovery in the US economy will see the Asian economies also recover over the coming year. ", " The increased optimism that the US will lead the world out of recession has given a boost to the US dollar over the past few months. The trade-weighted value of the US dollar has appreciated by 4 per cent over the past three months, and touched a new 15-year high in January (Graph 17). The rise of the US dollar has been broadly based, with the unit up against all major currencies since the end of October. The most significant gains have been against the Japanese yen, against which it has risen 9 per cent since the end of October. The yen has been very weak in its own right over this period, falling significantly against all the major currencies as a result of the continued deterioration of the Japanese economy. ", " Reflecting the strength of the US dollar, the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar has again fallen in recent months, and is now towards the lower end of the range it has been in since weakening in 2000 (Graph 18). It remains around 25 per cent below the level at which it came into existence. ", " The safe-haven flows that were evident in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, which saw funds flow to countries with large financial surpluses such as Switzerland and Japan, seem to have been largely reversed. These flows had caused the Swiss franc to rise by about 7 per cent against the US dollar in the days after <span class=\"no-wrap\">September 11</span>, but most of this rise has since been unwound. The appreciation of the yen which occurred during that period has been more than reversed. ", " The Argentine peso was devalued by 29 per cent on 7 January with an official rate of 1.40 peso per US dollar operating for trade and capital transactions, and a floating rate applying for retail and tourist transactions. However, most foreign exchange transactions were undertaken at the floating rate, with the official rate abandoned in early February. Since the devaluation, trading in the peso has been very thin, with the floating rate fluctuating between 1.7 and 2.2 pesos per US dollar. In contrast, the Brazilian and Chilean currencies have appreciated against the US dollar. Currencies of Asian emerging markets that float have been broadly stable over the past few months. ", " The past three months have been a fairly steady period for the Australian dollar, with the exchange rate generally in the range of 51–52US cents (Graph 19). It has risen against most other major currencies in recent months, particularly against the Japanese yen. The exchange rate against the yen has recently been close to 70, which is the highest reading for a couple of years and about 25 per cent above the recent low in September 2001. The rate against the euro has risen to a little under 60, towards the top end of the range it has been in since late 1999. The close correlation between the Australian dollar and the euro that had been a focus of market attention, particularly in 2000, seems to have broken down somewhat recently, as the economic circumstances of Australia and Europe have diverged. ", " Reflecting this strength against these major currencies, the TWI has risen over the past few months. It is up about 2 per cent from its average level in the second half of 2001. The current level of the TWI, at 50.4, is nonetheless about 10 per cent below its long-run average. ", " Apart from the instability that followed the terrorist attacks, the Australian dollar has been in a fairly steady range since April last year. This stands in sharp contrast to the fall of about US15 cents (or 25 per cent) that took place over the previous 15 months. ", " As discussed in earlier <em>Statements</em>, capital flows data seem to confirm that international fund managers lost interest in the Australian equity market in 2000, most likely because of the then fashionable view that Australia was an ‘old’ economy. Foreign portfolio investment into Australian equities turned negative in 2000, whereas it had been running at around $15 billion a year through 1998 and 1999. At the same time, investment in foreign equities by Australian fund managers also increased (Graph 20). The puzzle was that all this took place at a time when the US share market was falling sharply, while the Australian market continued to strengthen. Since the start of 2000, US share prices have fallen by 26 per cent, while Australian shares have risen by 10 per cent. ", " The strong outperformance of the Australian share market appears to have been recognised more recently. Inflows of portfolio investment into Australian equities strengthened markedly again by mid 2001 (the latest data available are for the June quarter 2001), returning to around their levels of 1998 and 1999. This apparent reversal in sentiment towards Australian investments may have been a factor in the greater stability of the exchange rate over the past 10 months. ", " Flows into Australian bonds have also turned positive again, after having been negative for most of the period since 1997 (Graph 21). The widening interest differential in Australia's favour over the past year would have been an important factor in this. Increased demand by Japanese retail investors for Australian bonds has been particularly noticeable. Following a period of minimal flows between 1997 to 2000, Australian dollar Eurobond issuance made to the Japanese retail market, known as A$ Uridashi issues, increased sharply over the second half of 2001 (Graph 22). About A$5.0 billion of such issues were made in the second half of last year, which was greater than the previous peak seen in the mid 1990s (though not as large as the dual currency issues of the mid 1990s).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " Net flows of direct investment into Australia remain negative (Graph 23). This is not because foreign companies have stopped investing in Australia; the flow of investment into Australia from foreign companies remains solid. Rather, Australian companies have sharply increased their direct investment abroad. ", " Given the recent stability of the exchange rate and orderly market conditions, the RBA has not undertaken any foreign exchange intervention over the past three months. Sales of foreign exchange to the Government have totalled $1.6 billion, but these have been largely offset by earnings in reserves and other foreign exchange transactions. As such, there has been little change in net reserves over the past three months. ", " Growth in the Australian economy strengthened over the course of 2001 against a backdrop of weakening world economic conditions. GDP increased at an annualised rate of 4 per cent over the three quarters to September 2001, after a period of declining output over the second half of 2000 (Graph 24, Table 7). The deterioration in the world economy has been reflected in a switch in the composition of Australian growth from external to domestic demand, with the external sector subtracting from growth over the second half of 2001 after contributing 2 percentage points to growth over the preceding year. Growth in final demand accelerated in most states over the year to the September quarter 2001, with Western Australia and Queensland amongst the fastest growing states over this period, while NSW continued to lag behind. ", " The outlook for domestic demand remains positive. Forward indicators suggest that the dwelling sector should continue to contribute to growth in the first half of this year. Businesses are also expected to increase investment over the course of 2002, with no sign at an aggregate level of a significant investment or inventory overhang. Indices of consumer and business confidence have also improved and are currently at levels typically associated with at least trend growth in output. However, the contribution to growth from dwelling investment is likely to fade around the middle of 2002, and may subtract from growth in the latter part of the year. There is also some risk that weakness in the labour market may dampen consumer spending. ", " Growth in household spending was firm throughout 2001 following a period of weakness over 2000. Consumer spending rose by 0.8 per cent in the September quarter to be around 3½ per cent higher than a year earlier. Growth in the volume of retail sales slowed in the December quarter, with sales increasing by 0.5 per cent, to be 4.8 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 25). The slowdown was largely a result of a decline in spending on hospitality and services, in part reflecting a drop-off in tourism. Over the course of the year, household spending on goods accelerated modestly while spending on services grew quite rapidly. ", " The increase in the growth of the consumption of goods reflects the flow-on from the rebound in housing activity to purchases of household furnishings, with sales of household goods and sales at department stores recovering over the year. Food retailers continue to experience strong growth in turnover, although this partly reflects higher prices. Sales of motor vehicles have steadied following a GST-related surge in the second half of 2000. ", " Spending on health services has continued to make a large contribution to growth in consumption. While comprising only 5 per cent of consumption expenditure, health spending has accounted for around one-third of the increase in consumption over the past year. This mainly reflects the rise in demand for health services associated with the large increase in the number of people taking out private health insurance over the past few years in response to government initiatives. With the proportion of the population with health insurance levelling out, growth in spending on health services may ease in coming quarters. In contrast, spending on hotels, cafes and restaurants has weakened in recent months, after growing strongly earlier in the year, reflecting the adverse effects on the domestic tourism industry of the recent downturn in overseas arrivals and the collapse of Ansett. ", " The solid pace of consumption growth seems consistent with trends in consumer sentiment. According to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute measure, consumer sentiment has rebounded in recent months, to be well above the level prevailing prior to the terrorist attacks in the US. The indices of sentiment relating to personal finances and economic conditions remain above their long-run average levels, with the latter at particularly high levels. Sentiment towards buying a major household item has risen to its highest level since mid 1999. ", " Household income growth has not been overly supportive of consumption, with real gross household income increasing at an annualised pace of 2 per cent in the six months to September, mainly reflecting the subdued growth in employment over this period. Nonetheless, household spending power has been boosted by the decline in petrol prices, which fell by about 12 per cent over the year to the December quarter. Household interest expenses also declined over the course of 2001, in line with the easing in monetary policy. ", " Consumption spending has been supported by the high level of household assets and an ongoing expansion in debt (Graph 26). The value of household assets declined marginally in the September quarter, with strong gains in dwelling prices more than offset by a sharp fall in equity values. However, equity markets have subsequently retraced these losses. Higher household asset values have supported continuing strong growth in household indebtedness by bolstering sentiment and boosting collateral values for existing owners of assets. Household credit grew at an annualised rate of 16½ per cent over the six months to December, up from 13 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months to June</span>, driven by significant increases in lending for housing to both owner-occupiers and investors. Growth in personal credit has slowed, though some of the growth in housing indebtedness may reflect drawdowns of existing home loans to finance consumption spending. Growth in household borrowing has led to a further increase in the ratio of household debt to disposable income, a trend evident in Australia over the past decade. ", " Over that period, the Australian household sector has moved from having a relatively low level of debt by international standards to a position where the debt-to-income ratio is comparable to that in other countries (Graph 27), consistent with an adjustment to deregulated financial markets and lower interest rates. It is not clear what would be a sustainable debt-to-income ratio in the longer term, but some deceleration in the growth of household indebtedness would be desirable in coming years. While both balance-sheet and cash-flow measures, such as assets-to-debt and interest-payments- to-income ratios, show that the aggregate household financial position is sound, the increase in indebtedness leaves the sector more sensitive to changes in interest rates and asset values. ", " Dwelling investment rebounded strongly in the second half of 2001. The recovery began earlier in the smaller states, which had a disproportionate take-up of government incentives for first-home buyers. Construction of new dwellings increased by 23 per cent in the September quarter while spending on alterations and additions continued to rise, albeit less rapidly. The high level of building approvals and loan approvals for new construction in the second half of 2001 suggests that dwelling investment will continue to contribute to growth over the next couple of quarters. ", " There are signs, however, that building approvals may have reached a peak, with a moderate easing in approvals data in recent months (Graph 28). Loan approvals for new construction have also fallen and in November were <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> lower than their peak in July. Information collected by State Revenue Offices indicates that the number of First Home Owner Grants paid fell in December (Graph 29). A fall was also evident, but less pronounced, in the Commonwealth Additional Grant paid for new housing. ", " In November, the Government announced some changes to the Commonwealth Additional Grant, which should reduce the transitional impact when the scheme expires. The changes extend the scheme from end December 2001 to end June 2002, while reducing the amount of assistance in the interim period from $7,000 to $3,000. The expiration of the scheme should not have as large an effect on the dwelling cycle as the introduction of the GST. The scheme only affects first-home buyers, who accounted for a little more than 30 per cent of loan approvals for owner-occupation (excluding refinancing) in the second half of 2001, compared with an average share of around 26 per cent over the past decade. ", " Nonetheless, the strength of building approvals in the second half of 2001 suggests some moderate degree of oversupply is developing in parts of the housing market. Oversupply is particularly evident in medium-density dwellings, where there are high vacancy rates in some states. Vacancy rates for rental accommodation in Sydney are at a high level of just over 4 per cent, while the vacancy rate in Melbourne, at almost 5 per cent, is at its highest level since the early 1990s. ", " The strong growth in housing demand has maintained upward pressure on house prices in most capital cities (Graph 30). According to stratified ABS data, which attempt to remove the effect of compositional change in the sample of houses sold, the larger capital cities all recorded growth in house prices of more than 5 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Melbourne recorded the strongest increase – over 30 per cent – though Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra also recorded double-digit growth. The strength in Melbourne house prices is consistent with Victoria's relatively strong economic performance in recent years and the resultant net inflow of migrants from other states which have increased demand for property. ", " While output continued to expand at a solid pace over 2001, there has been a change in the composition of growth (Table 8). The upswing in the residential construction cycle and the continued strength in retail trade in recent quarters has flowed on to the wholesale and manufacturing industries. The farm sector has also recorded solid growth in recent quarters, reflecting, in part, a recovery in the Australian wheat crop and strong beef and veal production. ", " In contrast, growth in the service sectors, which has contributed strongly to economic growth in recent years, is beginning to slow. Growth in business services has eased further in recent quarters due mainly to the shake-out in the telecommunications industry. Recent adverse developments in the tourism sector may result in a further slowing in the household services sector. Domestic aircraft movements at major airports have recovered from the disruption in September, but remain below their usual levels. International passenger movements, which have increased significantly from their recent trough, also remain below normal. Bookings with inbound tour operators point to the possibility of further weakness in international arrivals in coming months. Reflecting developments in the airline industry, hotel occupancy continues to be low, especially in areas reliant on business and overseas travel. This has been partially offset by increased tourism activity in some regions that are readily accessible by car. ", " Business surveys have generally reported a rebound in business conditions to a level consistent with <span class=\"no-wrap\">robust growth (Graph 31)</span>. The economy-wide quarterly NAB business survey reported that the index of business conditions in the December quarter remained above its long-run average, with improvements reported by the transport and storage, retail and rural sectors, although conditions in communications, finance, business and property services and recreational and personal services were reported to have deteriorated. The NAB quarterly survey reported a decline in business confidence, but the more recent monthly survey for December showed a marked rebound in confidence. The ACCI-Westpac survey and other surveys pertaining to the manufacturing sector have reported that business conditions in the December quarter remained strong, as manufacturing continues to benefit from the flow-on effects of the increase in residential construction activity. Business conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises, as reported in the Yellow Pages survey, improved in the three months to October though they are not as strong as the economy-wide measures. ", " Business investment increased in the September quarter by nearly 2 per cent in volume terms, with investment in machinery and equipment and buildings and structures both rising. Investment in intangible fixed assets has contracted over the last two quarters after recording very strong growth in previous years. The fall in the September quarter was primarily driven by declines in mineral and petroleum exploration. Expenditure on computer software, which accounts for most of intangible fixed asset investment, rose slightly in the September quarter after falling in the previous period, though growth remains relatively subdued in the context of generally weak conditions for the ITC sector. ", " Investment as a share of GDP remains low by historical standards, indicating that there is scope for a recovery in investment in the period ahead (Graph 32). The ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey indicates moderate growth in overall business investment this financial year though the expected increase in investment is narrowly based. Much of the growth is expected to come from the mining sector, reflecting strong profits in that sector in recent years as well as a relatively high level of capacity utilisation, though investment in the transport and storage sector is also expected to contribute significantly. Investment intentions for 2001/02 in most other industries declined in the September quarter. Strong growth in mining-sector investment intentions is also reflected in the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em>. ", " Investment intentions for machinery and equipment, as reported in the Capex survey, suggest modest growth in 2001/02 in nominal terms. The large upward revision to expected investment in the transport and storage sector is most likely due to planned fleet expansions and upgrades being undertaken by the domestic airlines. Machinery and equipment investment in the manufacturing and communication industries is expected to decline in 2001/02. ", " Forward-looking indicators of buildings and structures investment suggest that a recovery in this type of investment is underway. The value of commencements and work yet to be done on engineering construction by the private sector rose strongly in the September quarter. The latter probably reflected the commencement of two major projects – the fourth train expansion of the North-West Shelf LNG plant, projected to cost $1.6 billion over three years, and the Darwin-Alice Springs railway line, projected to cost $1.3 billion over the same period. A number of resource-related projects are also expected to commence in the next two years. Non-residential building activity was broadly flat over most of 2001, but the strength in approvals during the year and the build-up in work yet to be done in recent quarters suggests that a pick-up in non-residential construction activity can be expected. The low levels of vacancy rates for office property in the capital cities remain broadly supportive for investment, though there has been a mild increase in vacancies in recent quarters, in line with some rationalisation in the finance, insurance and technology sectors. ", " The softness in investment in recent quarters and the expectation of only moderate growth in the near term has been reflected in business funding (Graph 33). The deceleration in the pace of growth of external funding over the second half of 2001 primarily reflected weakness in intermediated business borrowing. However, the quarterly pattern suggests a mild acceleration in the pace of growth of business credit in recent months and business loan approvals also appear to have stabilised. Market capital raisings continued apace, with equity raisings in particular remaining at high levels, in line with strength in equity prices. ", " Corporate sector profits as measured by GOS were little changed in the September quarter, and as a share of GDP they remained at levels slightly below the average of the past decade (Graph 34). Reflecting the strength in domestic demand, domestically oriented sectors reported improved profitability in the September quarter after falling substantially over the preceding year. The profitability of small businesses, as measured by GOS of unincorporated enterprises, increased by 5.7 per cent in the September quarter, after a period of subdued performance, reflecting the pick-up in the housing and retail sectors. ", " Aggregate indicators suggest that the financial position of businesses remains sound. The interest burden remains at very low levels, with recent reductions in official interest rates serving to lower the cost of funds to corporates further (Graph 35). The recent emphasis on equity raisings, rather than debt, has contributed to a lower aggregate corporate debt-to-equity ratio. ", " The recovery in output growth in 2001 is not yet evident in the labour market, which remains weak (Graph 36). Employment grew marginally in the December quarter and was only 0.9 per cent higher over 2001. Full-time employment grew by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter but was 1.1 per cent lower over the year. Part-time employment also increased by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter, but was 6.2 per cent higher over the year. The weak demand for labour has seen the unemployment rate rise by almost ¾ of a percentage point from its trough in September 2000. The participation rate continues to be volatile, but has been broadly flat over the past two years. ", " Reflecting the developments in economic activity, there continue to be divergent trends in employment growth across industries (Table 9). The most significant weakness has been in business services employment, which fell by 3.6 per cent in the December quarter and by 4.7 per cent over the year. Employment in the household services sector rose slightly in the December quarter, following disruptions to activity in the tourism industry. The recovery in the dwelling sector has been reflected in strong growth in employment in construction and, to a lesser extent, manufacturing. ", " Labour productivity, as measured by output per hour worked in the economy, increased by 2.0 per cent in the September quarter and by 4.2 per cent over the year (Graph 37). This suggests that the higher trend productivity growth that has been observed over the 1990s has been regained, after a cyclical slowdown in 2000. Labour productivity in the construction sector has returned to more normal levels having been unusually low in 2000/01, as employment in the construction sector has continued to improve, but at a slower pace than the rebound in housing activity. ", " Queensland recorded the fastest employment growth over the year to the December quarter, although the unemployment rate in that state remains above the national average (Table 10). NSW was the only state to record a fall in employment in the December quarter and, with the exception of Tasmania, had the lowest growth in employment over the year. The relatively weak labour market performance in NSW has been associated with the largest increase in state unemployment rates. ", " Forward-looking indicators of the labour market have stabilised in recent months but remain at relatively <span class=\"no-wrap\">low levels (Graph 38)</span>. All measures of job vacancies remain significantly lower than their peaks in mid 2000. The sharp increase in the ANZ series in January has brought it back into line with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) series, which was broadly unchanged in January, following a strong increase in December. The ABS employer-based measure of vacancies fell by 1.9 per cent in the December quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">23 per cent</span> lower than a year ago, which represents a continued easing in the rate of decline in this measure. Survey-based measures of employment intentions remain at, or above, levels that are consistent with trend employment growth. On balance, these indicators present a firmer tone than in recent quarters, but suggest that labour market conditions are not likely to change significantly in the near term. ", " After a couple of years of strong growth, the export sector contracted in the second half of 2001 as the world slowdown took effect (<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>). With export volumes falling in the December quarter, and stronger domestic demand contributing to a significant increase in import volumes, net exports subtracted considerably from growth in GDP in the quarter, following a modest subtraction in the September quarter. Export prices, which had been resilient to the slowing world economy, fell slightly in the December quarter, contributing to a small decline in the terms of trade. As a result of these movements, the balance of trade moved into deficit in the December quarter, following three quarters of trade surpluses. Assuming the net income deficit remained constant as a share of GDP, this implies that the current account deficit in the December quarter is likely to have increased from its recent low of 1.6 per cent of GDP in the September quarter, to be around 3½ per cent of GDP (Graph 39). ", " In contrast to the previous period of trading-partner weakness during the Asian crisis, the synchronised weakness in the world economy has limited the scope for export diversion. Nonetheless, Australian exporters appear to be making some inroads into markets in the Middle East and south Asia, with merchandise exports to these regions still growing strongly (Table 11). Exports to east Asia, however, have been weak: total exports of resources to Singapore and Indonesia almost halved over the past year, while total exports of manufactures to Singapore, <span class=\"no-wrap\">Hong Kong</span> and Taiwan have fallen by almost 25 per cent. Exports to Korea have held up due to the strength of domestic demand there. Exports to Japan have fallen over the past year, with resource exports, which constitute around 70 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports to Japan, accounting for much of the slowing. While merchandise exports to China fell over the past three months, this follows a period of very strong growth. ", " Resource exports appear to have fallen in both value and volume terms over the second half of 2001, after growing solidly over the previous two years (Graph 40). Exports of coal have levelled out after recording strong growth over 2000. Demand for thermal coal is expected to remain firm owing to the continued commissioning of new coal-fired power stations in Asia and the reduction in subsidies paid to European coal producers in recent years, though Australia is facing increased competition from China. Coking coal exports are also expected to remain at a high level, with the expected fall in Japanese steel production offset by increases in Korea, Taiwan and some European countries; in addition, lower US and Canadian coking coal output has led to tighter supply conditions. Aluminium demand, along with demand for the other major base metals, has fallen in recent months amid ongoing economic weakness in the US and Japan, and contractions in demand from south-east Asia and Europe. ", " The growth in rural export values over the past year has reflected large increases in the price of rural commodities, with rural export volumes declining over the course of 2001. Cereal export volumes have fallen modestly, following very strong wheat production in the last two financial years. Further falls in wheat production in 2001/02 are expected by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), though the fall in exports is expected to be smaller due to a rundown in stocks. Meat export volumes remain at a high level, though beef and veal production is expected to be slightly weaker in the current financial year. With consumer demand for beef in Japan falling following the detection of ‘mad cow’ disease in Japanese herds, and exports to the US running up against import quotas, some beef is being diverted to other markets, particularly in east Asia. Wool export volumes have fallen over the past 18 months as a consequence of reduced supply, due to a switch in farming production from wool to meat. Supply has been tightened further by the elimination of the wool stockpile last August. ", " The effect of the slowdown in world economic conditions has been most pronounced in manufacturing and service exports. Manufactured export volumes recovered slightly in the December quarter after falling by <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span> over the previous two quarters. Machinery exports fell by 22 per cent over the same period, but increased in the December quarter. Exports of transport equipment were flat over the past year, though this follows annualised growth of 14½ per cent over the preceding two years. ", " Service exports fell in the December quarter owing mainly to the adverse effect on global tourism of the September terrorist attacks in the US (Table 12). In line with global trends in passenger movements, short-term visitor arrivals to Australia in the December quarter fell by 14 per cent, following a 1 per cent fall in the previous quarter. Short-term arrivals from the US, UK and east Asia (excluding Japan) fell sharply following the terrorist attacks in the US, but by December they had recovered most of the fall. In contrast, arrivals from Japan and <span class=\"no-wrap\">New Zealand</span> remain on a downward trend. ", " Import values have been weaker over the past year owing to a fall in volumes (Graph 41). In the December quarter, however, import volumes increased. The strength in imports of consumption goods in the quarter was mainly accounted for by food and beverages and motor vehicles. Imports of capital goods, which experienced particularly large falls towards the end of 2000 and in early 2001, rebounded strongly in the second half of the year, reflecting a rise in machinery and equipment investment. Further rises in capital goods imports are expected during 2002 as a result of fleet expansions and upgrades being undertaken by the domestic airlines. In aggregate, imports from east Asia and the US have fallen in recent months, while imports from Japan, and particularly Europe, have held up over this period. ", " Consistent with lower interest rates globally, the net income deficit narrowed further in the September quarter, to 2.8 per cent of GDP. Debt-servicing ratios remain low by historical standards, with the ratio of net interest payments to exports remaining around 9 per cent in the September quarter. ", " Australia's net foreign debt increased in the September quarter to $331 billion, equal to 49 per cent of <span class=\"no-wrap\">GDP (Graph 42)</span>. Consistent with trends over the past couple of years, the increase was driven primarily by debt inflows, with the modest depreciation of the Australian dollar in the quarter also boosting the Australian-dollar value of foreign-currency denominated debt. Net foreign equity liabilities also rose, despite net equity outflows from Australia. The rise primarily reflected the valuation effect of the strength in the Australian share market relative to those abroad. Overall, net foreign liabilities increased to around 60 per cent of GDP. ", " Oil prices in recent months have traded at levels well below those prevailing during the previous <span class=\"no-wrap\">two years (Graph 43)</span>. The weaker world economic outlook, and the reluctance of non-OPEC oil-producing countries to cooperate with OPEC in cutting production levels, contributed to the weakness in oil prices in the latter part of 2001. More recently, however, an agreement from major non-OPEC countries, including Russia and Norway, to cut production in conjunction with OPEC's own cuts has contributed to a mild recovery in the oil price around the turn of the year. Since the end of 2000, OPEC production quotas have been reduced on four separate occasions, amounting to a 19 per cent reduction in quota volumes. ", " The RBA commodity price index, in SDR terms, has increased in recent months to be just below its recent peak and around 19 per cent higher than its low point in 1999 (Graph 44, Table 13). In Australian dollar terms, the index is 42 per cent above the trough reached in May 1999. Base metals prices have recovered in recent months owing to a reassessment by markets of the risks to the world outlook, as well as cutbacks in production of a number of base metals, though stocks continue to rise. The increase in aluminium prices has been more muted. Some cuts in aluminium production have been announced, but have been offset by substantial increases in production in China and Russia. ", " Rural commodity prices eased towards the end of 2001, but have recovered strongly in the new year and are around 28 per cent higher than the lows recorded in the late 1990s. Beef and veal prices, after falling towards the end of 2001, have recovered owing to stronger US demand. Wool prices have moved higher again and are back above their two-year highs reached in April 2001. Very tight supply conditions – Australian wool production is at a 50-year low – have more than offset weaker consumer demand for wool products from Japan and the US, while Chinese demand appears to be picking up. Wheat prices remain high owing to reduced output by major wheat exporters. Sugar prices have been on a downward trend over the second half of 2001 due to upward revisions to estimates of world production, particularly from Brazil. ", " Non-rural commodity prices have changed little over the past three months. Gold prices gradually moved higher over 2001 as the downward trend in gold production, which has been evident for several years, continued. Reports of likely oversupply of thermal coal, arising from increased Chinese supply, led to a fall in the spot price during November from the high levels prevailing in the previous couple of months. More recently, prices have steadied around US$27 per tonne, thereby restoring the typical gap between the contract and spot <span class=\"no-wrap\">price (Graph 45)</span>. Contract prices for thermal and coking coal and iron ore are currently being renegotiated, with new contract prices to become effective in April. ", " At the time of the last <em>Statement</em>, in early November, short-term interest rates reflected expectations of substantial further monetary easings over the following six months; they amounted to between 75 and 100 basis points from the then cash rate of 4.5 per cent (Graph 46). These expectations were significantly unwound over the following weeks as concerns faded about the impact of the events of September 11 on global activity. Some of this had already happened by the time of the RBA's December Board meeting and its decision to ease by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 points</span> at that meeting was in line with market expectations. After that meeting, there were lingering expectations for a few weeks of another 25 point easing some time in the first half of 2002, but over recent weeks those too have disappeared as economic data here and in the US have continued to improve. This trend was reinforced by the Australian CPI result for the December quarter being higher than market expectations. ", " These changing expectations have not had much impact on yields on 90-day bills. They have been around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.25 per cent</span> over the past two months – i.e. broadly in line with the current cash rate. The changes have been more evident in slightly longer-term yields, such as on 180-day bills. These have risen from around 4.2 per cent in early December to around 4.4 per cent in early February. This represents a return to a more normal relationship between the yields on the two maturities after a period of close to a year when yields on the longer bills were typically below those on 90-day bills. ", " With the same decline in cash rates here as in the US over the last quarter, the spread between the cash rate in the two countries has remained unchanged at 250 basis points. Markets expect this differential to narrow marginally over coming months on the back of tightening of policy in the US from the <span class=\"no-wrap\">second quarter of 2002 (Graph 47)</span>. ", " Movements in yields on medium to long-term bonds have been more pronounced than movements at the short end of the yield curve (Graph 48). Yields on 10-year bonds reached a low point of around 5 per cent in early November. This was about 50 basis points below their level at the start of 2001 and, aside from a brief period in 1998, the lowest level of bond yields since the late 1960s. Subsequently, improving confidence and reduced expectations of policy easing saw yields rise by 50 basis points, by early December, and by a further 40 basis points since (Graph 49). ", " The rise in Australian bond yields over recent months has been largely in line with increases in yields in the US. The differential between Australian and US bond yields has remained within the range of 70 to 100 basis points that has prevailed since the middle of last year. More recently, the differential has been at the higher end of this <span class=\"no-wrap\">range (Graph 50)</span>. ", " Corporate bond yields have risen by less than government bond yields over the past few months. As a result, spreads on bonds rated A or above have narrowed and are now below their pre-September 11 levels. Spreads on BBB-rated bonds remain, on average, about 10 basis points above their September levels. In general, spreads on corporate bonds in Australia have narrowed by more than, and remain well below, those in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US (Graphs 51 and 52)</span>. ", " The recovery in corporate bond spreads has been most pronounced for A to AA grade bonds. Investors appear confident that these bonds are more likely to have their credit rating upgraded than downgraded. Telstra, for example, recently had its credit rating upgraded by Standard and Poor's to AA− from A+. Expectations of actual default are very low. Despite a number of prominent corporate collapses last year, there were no defaults on investment-grade bonds (the only kind on issue in Australia). In contrast, Standard and Poor's report that <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> of investment-grade bonds worldwide defaulted in 2001, close to a record level. ", " The December easing of policy was passed fully onto households, with mortgage and credit card rates falling <span class=\"no-wrap\">by 25 basis</span> points. ", " The latest reductions in housing rates have seen them fall almost 0.5 percentage points below their 1998/99 cyclical lows (Table 14). The current standard variable rate, at 6.05 per cent, and the basic mortgage <span class=\"no-wrap\">rate (5.50 per cent)</span> remain the lowest mortgage rates since March 1970 and July 1968 respectively (Graph 53). ", " As with previous easings in monetary policy in 2001, pass-through to small business rates has been incomplete. Margins on small business loan indicator rates have been drifting up since November 1999 (during both the tightening and easing phases of monetary policy). They have increased most for overdrafts and loans secured by assets other than residential property (Graph 54). Despite this, the margin between the weighted average rate actually paid by small businesses and the cash rate has fallen slightly over the same period. This suggests that businesses have been able to offset the rising margins on indicator loans either by taking up special offers or switching to lower-cost products or lenders. ", " Interest rates on fixed-rate loans for housing and small business have risen in recent months, in contrast to the declines in interest rates on variable-rate loans (Graph 55). These increases have been smaller than those of swap rates, from which intermediaries price their fixed-rate loans, and fixed rates remain around the lowest seen in recent years. However, the proportion of loans at fixed rates has been declining, most likely due to the falls in variable rates. This is true for both households and small businesses. ", " Issuance of both corporate and asset-backed bonds in the December quarter was down by around 20 per cent from that in the previous quarter (Graph 56). This was a fairly good outcome given the slow start to the quarter and the usual December inactivity. Corporate issuance was boosted by one large raising of $1 billion. The size of this raising is indicative of the improved capacity of the domestic corporate bond market. The raising in question was the largest without credit enhancement yet to be made by a domestic non-financial corporate. ", " Strength in the first three quarters of the year meant that non-government bond issuance was substantially higher in 2001 than in 2000 ($33.6 billion compared to $28 billion) (Table 15). Domestic asset-backed issuance for the year was particularly strong and included a large increase in the number of smaller non-residential mortgage-backed issues. At $13.7 billion, issues of asset-backed bonds were more than twice their level two years earlier. There was also around $14 billion of asset-backed issuance into offshore markets during 2001. ", " Asset-backed issuance into offshore markets has matched domestic issuance for several years and there are outstandings of about $35 billion in each market segment. Foreign investors are attracted to Australian issues due to the default history of home loans in Australia being lower than in the US and the UK, and by credit enhancement of the bonds provided by mortgage insurance. For the issuers, offshore markets are attractive because they are able to absorb large deals more readily than the domestic market. ", " In the domestic corporate market, one notable trend through the year was that non-residents' share of corporate issuance declined markedly. Early in the year, they had accounted for over half the corporate issues in Australia, but by the fourth quarter this proportion was down to 10 per cent. Those earlier large issues reflected opportunities for foreign companies to reduce funding costs by borrowing in Australia and swapping the proceeds back to US dollars. By late in the year, changes in spreads meant that these opportunities had been largely removed. Nonetheless, for the year as a whole, non-residents were the largest group of bond issuers in Australia. ", " Issues by financial institutions were up a little on the previous year but well down on earlier years. In 1999, for example, financial institutions accounted for around a half of bond issuance, and two-thirds the year before that. Issuance by domestic non-financial corporates (‘pure corporates’) declined a little in 2001 from the high figure the previous year when debt financing by former public utilities such as electricity generators and airports made large issues. There was also a decline last year in the proportion of bond issues carrying a floating interest rate. ", " After a number of years of very strong growth, outstandings of non-government bonds levelled out in the second half of 2001, at around $100 billion, as maturities largely offset new issues (Graph 57). Analysts expect this to be temporary, with new issuance outweighing maturities in the year ahead. ", " Australian share prices continue to be stronger than those in most other major countries, including the US. Like markets elsewhere, the Australian marked recovered strongly from the fall that followed the September events. But whereas some markets have declined again in the past month, particularly in the US where there are growing concerns about corporate governance, the Australian market has risen further. It is the only major market in the world where share prices remain close to their peak (Graph 58). In other markets, they are down around <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span> from their early-2000 peaks. This stronger outcome is largely mirroring the relatively strong performance of the Australian economy. Corporate profitability in Australia has remained much more robust than in the US. ", " The recent strength has been in both the resource sector and the bank and insurance sector (Graph 59). The resource sector has been buoyed by good profits and takeover activity. With a solid domestic economy, bank shares have also been in strong demand as markets see little prospect of recent strong earnings growth being interrupted. The losses incurred by NAB on its HomeSide subsidiary have been seen by markets as largely one-off, and as such have not had a lasting impact on the overall banking index. Bank share prices also have not been materially affected by the collapse of Enron in the US. At $562 million, the four major banks' combined unsecured exposure to Enron increases their impaired asset ratios only a little, to around 0.65 per cent from around 0.60 per cent of their on-balance sheet assets. By historical standards, this figure remains very low. ", " Share valuations relative to the latest profits (i.e. P/E ratios) have again risen in recent months, taking them further above the long-run average. The current aggregate P/E ratio for the Australian market is 26, up from 23 in October. The long-run average is about 15. The ratio is being supported by bullish profit expectations in the period ahead; in the current year, analysts expect industrial companies' profits to increase by 14 per cent, a very strong rate of increase. ", " Net equity issuance slowed during the December quarter to around $3.5 billion from $5.7 billion in the previous quarter, but was broadly in line with raisings during the first two quarters of the year (Graph 60). Net equity issuance for the whole of 2001, at $15.4 billion, was slightly stronger than in 2000. ", " Financial conditions continue to be expansionary. Monetary policy was eased by 25 basis points in December, reducing the cash rate to its lowest level in almost 30 years (Graph 61). The easing has translated into further falls in interest rates on loans from financial intermediaries, supporting strong expansion in credit to households; growth in business credit, however, remains subdued. Yields on financial market debt instruments are still at low levels by historical standards, notwithstanding a rise in yields on longer-dated maturities over the past couple of months that has made the slope of the yield curve more positive. Increases in equity prices have encouraged a high level of equity raisings. The real exchange rate remains low and is supportive of the traded sector. ", " The 25 basis point easing in monetary policy in December took the cumulative easing this cycle to 200 basis points. An approximate benchmark for assessing the stance of policy is the average real cash rate over the period since 1992, a period in which there has been stable inflation and strong economic growth. A range of measures of real interest rates are presented in Table 16, all of which show that real interest rates are currently below that average. Based on a measure calculated from underlying inflation, the real cash rate appears highly expansionary, being 2½ percentage points below average. The deviations from average are smaller when real interest rates are calculated using inflation expectations derived from the bond market or consumer surveys. Real home loan interest rates are clearly expansionary on any of these measures, reflecting the fall in margins charged by intermediaries on housing loans over the 1990s. Real lending rates charged to business are also below average, though by a smaller margin than is the case for housing loan rates. ", " The slope of the yield curve in Australia, as measured by the difference between 10-year bond yields and the 90-day bank bill rate, has steepened over recent months (Graph 62). This reflects more accommodative monetary policy, which has pushed short-term interest rates lower, and bond market perceptions that prospects for economic recovery have improved, which has shifted long-term interest rates higher. ", " Credit grew at an annualised rate of around 7½ per cent over the six months to December, somewhat below the rate recorded over the previous six months (Graph 63). Borrowing activity continues to be dominated by households. Lending to households increased by an annualised rate of around 16½ per cent over the six months to December, compared with a small decline in business credit. The rapid expansion in household borrowing, driven by lending for housing, reflects low interest rates in the housing sector and the impetus from the Government's First Home Owner Grant. On the business side, surveys confirm that interest rates are not a constraint on business activities, and on-market raisings through debt and equity have maintained a solid pace. As outlined in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’, the slower pace of overall business borrowing activity in 2001 is broadly consistent with the easing in investment expenditure over the past year or so. Loan approvals data suggest that the divergence between growth in household and business credit will narrow in coming months. ", " On the liability side of intermediaries' balance sheets, growth in the broader monetary aggregates accelerated over the latter part of 2001. Broad money grew at an annualised rate of 13½ per cent over the six months to December, up from 9½ per cent in June. With growth in domestically sourced liabilities now outstripping that in assets, financial intermediaries reduced their offshore borrowings over the period, in marked contrast to the strong growth in offshore borrowing recorded in recent years. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar was relatively stable in 2001. In December, the real exchange rate, which adjusts for differences in inflation across our trading partners, was close to its level of a year earlier, remaining around 14 per cent below its 1990s average (Graph 64). More recently, the trade-weighted value of the currency has risen a little, primarily reflecting an appreciation against the yen. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.9 per cent in the December quarter, after rising by 0.3 per cent in the September quarter, to be 3.1 per cent higher over 2001 (Graph 65). The increase in the quarter reflected sharp rises in the prices of some food items and the cost of airline travel which were partly offset by a further fall in petrol prices. ", " Measures of underlying inflation are providing different estimates of the rate of core inflation. Measures that use statistical criteria, such as the weighted median and trimmed mean, suggest core inflation was around <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.7 per cent</span> in the December quarter and around 3¼ per cent over the year (Table 17). Other measures which are based on the exclusion of a fixed basket of items, such as market sector goods and services excluding volatile items, increased by around 1 per cent in the quarter and by 3.6 per cent over the year. The differences reflect the differing approaches to constructing these underlying measures: the fixed-basket measures include those factors that on this occasion are adding to inflation (meat and air travel), while removing the main negative influence (petrol), resulting in a relatively high figure. On balance, the statistical measures are probably providing a more reliable indication of underlying inflation at present. ", " Although higher prices were recorded for almost all food categories, sharp increases in the prices of some fruit and vegetables made the largest contributions, reflecting weather-and disease-related supply problems. Meat prices again rose sharply, boosted by strong world demand for Australian meat products. Higher dairy prices also reflected strong world demand as well as a partial unwinding of earlier price falls associated with the restructuring of the industry. Excluding food, the CPI rose by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter and by 2.2 per cent over the year. ", " Domestic holiday travel and accommodation prices increased by 7.7 per cent in the December quarter, but were flat over the year. The rise in the quarter reflected a seasonal rise in price as well as recent developments in the airline industry, including the introduction of the Ansett and insurance airfare levies. These developments are likely to have some further effect in the March quarter. The cost of house purchase again rose by around 1 per cent in the December quarter, consistent with the recovery of the housing market. Other significant price increases were recorded for some items of women's clothing and telecommunications. Despite recording a slight fall in the quarter, insurance costs rose by 6 per cent over 2001 (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). ", " The most substantial offset to the general increase in prices in the December quarter was a 3.7 per cent fall in petrol prices, which brought the fall over 2001 to 12 per cent. Audio, visual and computing equipment prices also continued to fall in the quarter while lower health costs mostly reflected the seasonal effect of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. ", " Both tradables and non-tradables prices increased by 3.1 per cent over the year to the December quarter. Excluding petrol and food, tradables prices have been growing at a faster pace, rising by 3½ per cent over <span class=\"no-wrap\">2001 (Graph 66)</span>. This may reflect continued pass-through of the earlier exchange rate decline and may persist for a while yet, although the exchange rate has been relatively stable over the past year. ", " Input cost pressures continued to moderate over the course of 2001. Over the year to December, producer prices at all stages increased by less than 2 per cent, down from rates of over 5 per cent a year earlier (Table 18). A significant cause of the moderation has been falling oil prices, with the Asian benchmark oil price declining by <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> in the December quarter following a 10 per cent fall in September. ", " In contrast to the September quarter, import prices generally increased, apart from oil and computer equipment prices, with strong growth recorded in the prices of industrial machinery and motor vehicles. On an industry basis, producer price inflation remains moderate with a few exceptions, such as real estate agent services, which have risen by 10 per cent over 2001. There was also an increase in building construction prices, consistent with the upturn in activity in the construction sector. The prices of materials used in manufacturing fell by 1.9 per cent in December, whereas the prices of articles produced fell by 0.6 per cent. ", " Recent business surveys also suggest that upstream inflationary pressures have continued to moderate, and that growth in final prices is expected to remain low as a result. The economy-wide NAB survey reports that purchase costs increased by only 0.4 per cent in the December quarter and that firms expect costs to increase by an average of just ¼ per cent in the March quarter (Graph 67). The latest ACCI-Westpac survey reported a further easing in inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector. The net balance of firms expecting cost increases fell further in the December quarter. ", " Wage pressures remain well contained, reflecting the subdued conditions in the labour market (Graph 68). Growth in the Wage Cost Index (WCI) for total pay eased slightly in the September quarter to 3.6 per cent over the year, after having drifted up over the previous eighteen months. By industry, among the fastest rises in wages continued to be in property and business services and education, which both increased by 4.4 per cent over the year, while the retail sector again recorded the slowest growth, at 2.3 per cent. Data on enterprise bargaining agreements also indicate modest wage pressures. New federal enterprise agreements ratified in the September quarter provided an average annualised wage increase of 3.9 per cent, the same as in the previous quarter. Measures of unit labour costs have also eased in recent quarters to be growing at a rate of around 1¾ per cent over the year to September. ", " The average weekly earnings survey continues to be affected by compositional changes, which reduce its usefulness as an indicator of wages growth. The past couple of quarters have also been affected by a <span class=\"no-wrap\">higher-than-usual</span> sample rotation. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings of full-time adults (AWOTE) rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.4 per cent</span> in the September quarter to be 5 per cent higher than a year ago, down from 5.3 per cent in the June quarter. ", " According to the latest Mercer Cullen Egan Dell <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em>, the average annual wage increase for office workers edged up to 4½ per cent in the December quarter. The base salary of executives rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> over the course of 2001, up slightly from the pace of around 4¾ per cent reported in the previous couple of quarters. Recent business surveys also report that wage pressures remain in check, with the latest quarterly NAB survey reporting modest growth in labour costs in the December quarter and firms expecting this to continue in the March quarter. Firms report little difficulty attracting suitable labour, consistent with the relatively low levels of the major job vacancy series. ", " The Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) is expected to decide on the 2002 Safety Net Review of award wages in May. It is considering an application by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to increase all award rates of pay by $25 per week. ", " The inflation expectations of consumers have remained in a range between 3½ and 4½ per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">since mid 2000 (Graph 69)</span>. The Melbourne Institute survey reported that consumers' expectations for inflation over the coming year rose to 4.5 per cent in January from around 3½ per cent in November and December. Recent business surveys indicate that businesses have continued to moderate their expectations for inflation. The economy-wide NAB survey reported that inflation in final product prices and retail prices was expected to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the March quarter. The NAB survey also indicated that medium-term inflation expectations of businesses fell in the December quarter. A little less than 10 per cent of businesses expect inflation to average more than 4 per cent in the medium term (compared with around 30 per cent in the mid 1990s), while almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> of respondents expect inflation to average less than 3 per cent (compared with around 10 per cent in the mid 1990s). The latest ACCI-Westpac survey reported an easing in inflation expectations in the manufacturing sector for the March quarter. ", " In contrast, longer-term inflation expectations of investors, measured by the difference between 10-year bond yields and indexed bonds, have moved higher in recent months to average between 2¼ and 2½ per cent in December and January. Similarly, most financial-market economists surveyed by the Bank have made upward revisions to their forecasts for inflation following the release of the December quarter CPI (Table 19). The median inflation forecasts for the years to June 2002 and June 2003 have both increased to 2.4 per cent. Trade union officials surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT) have also revised up their expectations for inflation. ", " The various measures of underlying inflation give a range of readings for core inflation in the December quarter but, as discussed above, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation was around 3¼ per cent over the year to December, continuing the gradual upward trend in underlying inflation evident since 1999. This is in line with the forecasts presented in previous <em>Statements</em>, which indicated that underlying inflation would exceed the target for a short period. ", " Some of the sharp price rises that underpinned the December quarter outcome are likely to be temporary. Half of the increase in the CPI in the quarter was due to food, and it is probable some of these increases, in particular for fruit and vegetables, will be partly reversed over coming quarters. The prices for other items, such as meat and dairy products, may remain high in the near term, but should not continue rising at their current pace. Domestic travel and accommodation prices increased significantly in the quarter, consistent with previous seasonal patterns, but also reflected recent developments in the airline industry that are likely to provide a further boost to prices in the March quarter. The price increases for some categories of clothing and furniture follow a period of extensive discounting and may continue in the next few quarters as retailers seek to rebuild margins. The increase in house purchase costs could also persist for the next few quarters until activity in the housing sector slows. Thus while some of the sector-specific price pressures evident in the December quarter should dissipate, others may persist for another quarter or so. ", " However, the outlook for the medium-term determinants of inflation has not changed substantively in light of the recent data. Wage and labour cost growth remain contained and are likely to continue to be so given the prevailing weakness in the labour market. The stability of the exchange rate over the past year, combined with downward pressure on world prices from the subdued global economy, suggests that there will be little inflationary pressure from import prices in the medium term. Producer price data and business surveys suggest that upstream price pressures have continued to ease, underpinned by the decline in oil prices. ", " Given that the medium-term influences on inflation remain broadly unchanged, the Bank's assessment continues to be that underlying inflation is at or near its peak and will decline to around 2½ per cent through 2002. CPI inflation should remain close to the underlying measures. This is based on the assumption that the exchange rate remains at recent levels, and that oil prices drift moderately higher over the coming year. ", " The November <em>Statement</em> considered that the risks to the central forecasts were slightly weighted to the downside. The recent data suggest that upside risks to the outlook for inflation have subsequently increased, particularly in the near term. The current strength of the economy may result in more margin building in the quarters ahead than is currently allowed for. This would maintain the inflation rate at or near the top of the target and could lead to an upward shift in inflation expectations. In these circumstances, if the domestic economy were to gather strength, there would be a risk of inflation remaining above the target for a longer period. ", " At the same time, the downside risks to the inflation outlook identified in the November <em>Statement</em> remain. If the downturn in the global economy is more protracted than expected, there would be further downward pressure on international prices, in particular oil prices. This would contribute to slower than anticipated growth in the Australian economy and a more prolonged period of weakness in the labour market, further restraining wage and price increases. At present, the Bank considers these risks to the inflation outlook to be more evenly balanced. ", " Interpretation of earnings data from US companies has become more difficult recently as different measures are showing quite wide divergences (Graph A1). ", " The National Accounting estimate of profits remains the best available, as it is consistent over time, and captures all profits earned by US companies. However, equity markets focus mainly on aggregate earnings for the companies in the S&amp;P 500. ", " There are several ways in which S&amp;P 500 earnings are reported. Historically the focus was on ‘as reported’ earnings, which includes all receipts less expenses, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, over recent years market analysts and companies have increasingly focused on ‘operating’ earnings (also known as ‘pro forma’ or ‘as if’ earnings). These are intended to adjust for special one-off items to give a clearer picture of ongoing profits. The problem, however, is that there are no official guidelines for what items can be added in or taken out, as ‘operating’ earnings is not a concept defined under GAAP. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> has estimated that more than 300 companies in the S&amp;P 500 now publish measures of operating earnings which fail to take full account of expenses, which would be classified as ordinary expenses and hence subtracted from earnings calculated under GAAP. ", " Over 1999 and 2000, the S&amp;P measures of earnings rose much faster than the National Accounts measure. An important reason for this is said to have been the practice of firms not including the cost of options granted to employees as an expense. The National Accounts adjusts for this. Also, throughout this time operating earnings remained higher than ‘as reported’ earnings. ", " More recently, the S&amp;P measures have fallen sharply. In the year to the September quarter 2001, <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘as reported’</span> earnings of S&amp;P 500 companies fell by 61 per cent and ‘operating’ earnings fell by 33 per cent. The National Accounts measure fell by 22 per cent over the same period. ", " The divergence in earnings reports has complicated the calculation and interpretation of traditional benchmarks of share valuation such as price earnings ratios. Historically, P/E ratios for the S&amp;P 500 have been calculated by dividing the current level of share prices by the latest actual 12 months of ‘as reported’ earnings. Using this method, the P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 has recently risen strongly, to around 40 – well above the historical average of around 14, and the highest level seen over the past century. Using the last 12 months of ‘operating’ earnings as the denominator, the S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio is around 26. While this is below the P/E ratio calculated using ‘as reported’ earnings, it remains well above the historical average. ", " When valuing shares, it is future earnings which are most relevant. The aggregate P/E ratio for S&amp;P 500 companies, based on estimates of the coming year's operating earnings, is 21. This is below the other measures, but still relatively high. The assumed rise in operating earnings in the coming year, which underlies this figure, is 36 per cent. This would require a very strong recovery in the US economy. ", " The world economy has a significant influence on developments in the Australian economy through its effects on Australia's exports, both in terms of the amount sold and the price received for them, relative to the cost of imports. The scope of this channel has increased through time as the Australian economy has become more open. ", " The current slowdown in world growth is forecast by the IMF to be of a similar magnitude to the early-1990s slowdown for the industrial countries, but not as large as that in the mid 1970s or early 1980s. Reflecting the global slowdown, Australian export volumes declined in the September and December quarters. The terms of trade have remained relatively resilient. Despite falling in the December quarter, they are still higher than a year earlier, as import prices have fallen further than export prices (in foreign-currency terms). ", " To provide some context for the current situation, Table B1 documents episodes over the past 40 years where declines in export volumes or the terms of trade have subtracted at least 1 percentage point from domestic incomes. The table shows that some of these episodes occurred when the world economy was in recession, but a number of episodes were associated with only a relatively mild slowdown in world growth. Some of these differences reflect the extent to which Australia's trading partners were affected relative to the rest of the world. The table also shows that significant declines in export volumes and the fall in the terms of trade have rarely occurred simultaneously, with the Asian crisis being a notable exception. In that episode, the combined effects of a decline in export volumes and lower prices reduced Australian national income by around 2½ per cent – considerably more than in any of the three world recessions of the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. ", " These three world recessions had contrasting effects on the external sector. The decline in export prices in foreign-currency terms was considerably larger in the early 1990s than in the other two episodes, although the terms of trade decline was greatest following the 1970s recession reflecting rapid growth of import prices. However, whereas export volumes declined in both the 1970s and 1980s episodes, in the early 1990s, export volumes grew at a relatively rapid pace, increasing by 13 per cent in 1991 and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5½ per cent</span> in 1992. ", " In each of these three episodes, the effect of lost foreign earnings on national income was not large enough, in itself, to cause a recession – even allowing for the operation of a multiplier as demand and production responded to the initial loss of income. While international forces contributed to the severity of the recessions in the 1970s and 1980s, it was a contraction in domestic demand that was the more powerful force. This was even more the case in the early 1990s, where international factors did not have a significant negative effect on the economy through the external sector, yet Australia experienced a recession because domestic demand fell sharply during the process of unwinding the imbalances of the late 1980s. During the Asian crisis, in contrast, the strength of domestic demand kept the economy growing quite strongly, despite the pronounced contractionary influence from abroad. ", " This simple analysis suggests that while a pronounced weakening in global growth does affect Australia, whether or not this leads to a recession depends critically on the extent to which the Australian economy is already suffering from domestic problems. If the economy is relatively free of imbalances, there is a good chance that, even though the pace of GDP growth will moderate, an outright contraction in economic activity can be avoided. ", " The price of insurance has risen markedly over the past year and further price rises are likely in the period ahead. This follows substantial losses in the global insurance industry in recent years, an escalating assessment of future insurance payouts, the collapse of HIH and lower returns on the assets held by insurance companies. ", " The rise in reinsurance premiums following large losses due to natural and man-made catastrophes is one of the main reasons for an increase in costs to the Australian insurance industry (Graph C1). In 1999, there were an unusual number of large natural catastrophes around the world, including the Sydney hailstorm that was the eighth largest insured loss in the world in that year. The insured loss from the events of <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 September</span> is likely to exceed the largest preceding single-event loss, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, when the insurance industry paid claims of roughly US$20 billion (in 2001 prices). ", " As a consequence of these large losses, reinsurers' capital reserves have declined, and this has led to a contraction in the supply of reinsurance. In combination with an increase in demand for reinsurance, this has resulted in a sharp increase in price. In addition to this, a more long-lasting effect on insurance premiums from recent events will depend upon the extent to which the risk of both natural and man-made catastrophes is reassessed. A further reason why costs faced by the Australian insurance industry have increased is that the Australian community is becoming more willing to claim for losses incurred. This has led to an increase in the actuarial assessment of expected payouts, particularly for products such as public liability insurance. ", " As well as changes in costs, insurance premiums are influenced by the degree of competition in the insurance market. In recent years the Australian general insurance industry has been characterised by strong competition which has held down direct insurance premiums despite the rising costs. An important factor behind this was HIH's policy of aggressively building market share by offering lower premiums. With this effect no longer operating, a return to more normal practices would see some rise in premiums. ", " Insurance premiums affect the CPI directly through households' purchases of car, house and contents insurance which has a weight of 1.5 per cent in the CPI. The price of household insurance services in the CPI has increased by 6 per cent over the past year. However, there is also an indirect effect as rising commercial premiums for businesses are passed through to consumer prices. ", " Insurance industry surveys, such as the JP Morgan-Trowbridge Consulting-Deloitte survey, suggest that even prior to the events of September, industry observers were expecting some classes of commercial insurance premiums to rise by up to 20 per cent over the year to June 2002. The largest increases are expected for professional indemnity, public liability and commercial property insurance, as these areas are most affected by the problem of higher numbers of claims and higher reinsurance costs. More recently, the cost of products such as airline liability insurance have increased and have been passed on quickly to consumers.

During the first half of the year, despite a generally downward trend in share prices, there was a mood of cautious optimism about prospects for the US economy, where recovery had commenced after an apparently very mild and brief recession during the second half of 2001. Signs of a turning point in Europe and Japan had also emerged, and most forecasters expected global growth to gradually strengthen through the remainder of the year. The US dollar had begun to decline, and the Australian dollar to rise both against the US dollar and other currencies. ", " In the second half of June, however, market sentiment turned decidedly more bearish. At that stage, US share prices were still high relative to longer-run norms and there was a recognition that businesses would struggle to achieve the profit growth required to validate them. In addition, renewed doubts emerged about the strength of the economic recovery itself, as economic data for the middle of the year proved to be softer than expected. Revisions to earlier national accounts data, moreover, showed a noticeably lower level of economic activity through the past couple of years, and a somewhat deeper recession in the US than had earlier been thought, even if still a relatively mild one by historical standards. While all this was taking place, there was growing concern over the quality of corporate governance and accounting in the US. Earlier confidence that these problems were confined to a few isolated cases gave way to perceptions that there were systemic deficiencies. ", " In these circumstances, US share prices fell very sharply, particularly in the first three weeks of July. Even after a brief recovery late in the month, by early August the broad US share price indexes had declined by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">45 per cent</span> from their peaks in March 2000. Similar declines since the peak have been recorded in a number of European markets. The Australian share market has been more resilient, but has fallen nevertheless. Bond yields around the world have declined, and risk spreads have widened noticeably, over the past couple of months. Market expectations of monetary tightening in a number of countries, including Australia, have been scaled back. The exchange rate of the Australian dollar was particularly affected. It seems that once market participants started to feel that US share market developments could potentially have a dampening effect on US and world economic growth, they unwound long positions in the Australian dollar that they had built up in earlier months in anticipation of global economic recovery. Other currencies, such as the Canadian and New Zealand dollars, were similarly affected. In trade-weighted terms, the Australian dollar unwound all the rise that had taken place earlier in the year. ", " At the current juncture, then, confidence about US economic prospects is a good deal weaker than it was a few months ago, mainly because of financial developments, but not exclusively so; recent ‘real economy’ data have also been on the disappointing side. To this it must be added that the pick-up in growth in the Euro area has not, as yet, built much momentum, and while Japan is experiencing better growth, much of that is externally sourced. In contrast, in much of the east Asian region, increases in domestic demand have bolstered the impetus to growth from the export sector. Production has recovered to be around its peaks in late 2000, and the associated improvement in the labour market in a number of countries has helped support household spending. ", " In assessing global economic prospects the key issue is the extent to which the general weakness in equity markets will exert a dampening effect on activity in the major economies. The size of such an effect will depend, among other things, on the extent to which business and consumer confidence in the major economies are affected, on the way businesses respond to a higher cost of equity capital, and also on whether markets stabilise near their recent levels or decline further. All of these things are inherently difficult to predict. One important factor in assessing the overall impact is that economic behaviour may not have fully adjusted to the run-up in share prices in the late 1990s and so, to that extent, the impact of the subsequent decline could be somewhat limited. It should also be noted that the equity market declines have occurred against a background of expansionary policy settings that will help to offset at least some of their impact, and that the asset price declines have not apparently seriously undermined the asset quality of the global banking system. At this stage, while acknowledging the uncertainties, the most likely outcome in the major economies still appears to be one of moderate growth, though at a slower pace than earlier thought. ", " The Australian economy is continuing to grow more strongly than the major economies. Quarterly growth has been close to 1 per cent for some time and appears to have maintained a good pace in the June quarter. While the slowdown in the global economy in 2001 has been reflected in lower Australian exports, this has been compensated by the strength of domestic demand. Household spending has been an important driver of domestic demand, and conditions are generally supportive of further good growth. Household incomes are being supported by rising employment and real wages, and consumer confidence remains at a high level. While the pace of employment growth has slowed in recent months from the rapid growth experienced earlier in the year, forward indicators of the labour market suggest reasonably firm labour demand in coming months. ", " Housing construction has contributed to growth over the past year and, on the latest indications, is likely to remain at a high level in the second half of this year. Demand for investment housing remains strong, and lending to investors for housing has continued to rise at a fast pace in recent months. This looks to be in part a result of expectations by investors that the strong increases in housing prices over recent years will continue into the future. However, the attractiveness of this form of investment now appears to be waning, with the potential for further capital gains in the housing market likely to be countered by increased supply of rental properties, rising vacancy rates and falling rents in some areas. ", " The Australian business environment should contribute to a pick-up in investment spending, as already signalled in the business surveys. Business confidence is generally at levels consistent with good economic growth and corporate profits have risen at a healthy pace over the past year. The cost of external financing remains <span class=\"no-wrap\">low (although the recent turbulence may have reduced    the attractiveness of equity finance)</span> and this has been reflected in a marked pick-up in intermediated business borrowing. Notwithstanding this, the overall level of corporate debt remains low. While it is not yet clear whether the general equity market weakness over recent months will have any significant impact on business confidence and investment intentions, it is noteworthy that the corporate sector is in much sounder condition than it was on the previous occasion of sharp equity market declines, in the late 1980s. ", " The notable exception to the overall positive outlook for the Australian economy is the farm sector. A number of areas of the country – particularly New South Wales, southern Queensland and parts of the wheat belt in Western Australia – have experienced acute rainfall shortages, which are likely to have a detrimental effect on farm production and incomes. Conditions in South Australia, Tasmania and parts of Victoria, however, have been closer to normal. ", " The CPI outcome in the June quarter was consistent with the inflation forecasts presented in previous <em>Statements</em>. In year-ended terms, the statistical measures of underlying inflation have declined from a little over <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> in the December quarter 2001 to around 2½ per cent. The CPI measure of inflation is running at a slightly faster pace on a year-ended basis, and this may persist for another quarter or two yet. The divergence has predominantly reflected the large increases in the cost of overseas travel, insurance and meat in recent quarters. ", " The effect on inflation of the exchange rate depreciation of recent years appears to have broadly run its course, and the exchange rate appreciation in the earlier part of this year contributed to the low outcomes for producer price inflation in the June quarter. Combined with the moderate growth in wages, this means that there are few sources of pressure on business margins, with the continuing exception of rising insurance and utility costs. Consequently, as set out in previous <em>Statements</em>, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is likely to remain around the middle of the target band in the second half of 2002. However, a continuation of the current pace of growth in the domestic economy would most likely see increased pressures on wages and prices over the course of 2003. This outlook is predicated on a modest global recovery, albeit at a slower pace than seemed likely a few months ago. As discussed earlier, this appears the most plausible scenario for the world economy at present, although the downside risks have clearly increased in light of financial market developments over recent months. ", " In the environment of the stronger world economy in the first half of the year, the Board took the view at its <span class=\"no-wrap\">May and June</span> meetings that the expansionary stance of monetary policy which had been in place during late 2001 and early this year was no longer warranted, and that a process of returning rates to levels more consistent with the economy's more favourable circumstances should commence. At both meetings, it increased the cash rate by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span>. Even after these adjustments, however, the cash rate remained on the expansionary side of neutral. With the weight of domestic economic indicators pointing to continued strong growth, and inflation remaining in line with earlier forecasts, there was a general case to be considered at both the July and August meetings for further rises. ", " The Board also had to take account, however, of the sharp decline, and the considerably increased volatility, of global equity markets, and the possible impact of those changes on the economic outlook. As discussed above, those impacts are difficult to predict, not least because it is not yet known at what level markets will stabilise. If the effects on growth of the global economy, and consequently on Australia, turn out to be quite small, the case for further rises in interest rates would remain intact. While this appears the most plausible scenario, the possibility of a significant dampening impact of the financial turmoil on the global economy must be taken into account. Given these uncertainties, the Board judged at both its July and August meetings that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. ", " Equity markets have been at centre stage in recent months because of the high volatility and large net falls in all major countries. In the US, broad measures of stock prices, such as the Wilshire 5000 and S&amp;P 500 indices, have fallen by around 20 per cent over the past three months (though mostly in the first part of July) while the Nasdaq composite index has fallen around 25 per cent (Graph 1). ", " There are a number of aspects to the recent falls in US share prices that are worthy of note: ", " The unusual nature of recent events is to a large extent a consequence of the scale of the earlier rises in share prices. On various measures, the rise in share prices from 1995 stands out: the absolute size of the rise was extremely large; the ratio of share market capitalisation to GDP unprecedented; and P/E ratios rose to unusually high levels (Graph 2). It is interesting to note that the most rapid growth in share prices, from 1997 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 2000</span>, occurred during a period in which corporate profits (as measured by the National Accounts) were essentially flat (Graph 3). ", " Because of the growing perception that share market valuations had reached unusually high levels, share prices have become very sensitive to any signs of bad news on economic growth or corporate profits. Recent events casting doubt about the accuracy of corporate accounts in the US have had a particularly strong effect. In his recent Congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan drew attention to ‘the influence of growing concerns about corporate governance and business transparency problems that evidently accumulated during the earlier rapid run-up in these markets.’ ", " Equity markets have also weakened considerably across Europe (Graph 4). The Euro STOXX index fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">27 per cent</span> over the past three months, with the UK's FTSE index down by 21 per cent over the same period; these falls were larger than those seen in US markets. The STOXX index is now at its lowest level since October 1998, while the FTSE has fallen to its lowest level since January 1997 (Table 1). European equities have been affected by similar factors to those at work in the US. ", " The Japanese stock market also succumbed to the broader weakness, although the recent falls have not been as large as seen in the US and Europe. The Topix has fallen around 11 per cent over the past three months, but remains 4 per cent above the 17-year low reached in February. ", " Asian emerging equity markets have also declined by less than in the US and Europe over the past three months. Asian stocks fell around 15 per cent on average, with equity markets in the region appearing less overvalued than elsewhere and earnings growth expected to be stronger due to relatively healthy domestic economies (Graph 5). The declines in Latin America, however, were somewhat larger, at around 22 per cent. ", " The outlook for policy interest rates in the major economies has changed significantly over the past few months, as the recent sharp falls in equity prices have created uncertainty about the pace of global economic recovery in the major countries. ", " In the US, strong economic growth in the March quarter had prompted financial markets to expect a relatively quick tightening path over 2002 from the current low levels (Graph 6). By the end of March, the Federal Funds futures market was implying that the first 25 basis point increase would occur in May 2002, with a cumulative increase of 175 basis points, to 3.50 per cent, expected by the end of the year. However, growing uncertainty about the strength of the economic outlook in the face of lower equity prices and weaker-than-expected US growth in the June quarter has since seen expectations for the first increase pushed well into 2003 (Graph 7). Indeed, the talk of a possible ‘double dip’ in US economic activity has led the Federal Funds market to price-in a significant probability of a cut in US policy rates before the end of 2002. ", " Expectations for interest rate increases in Europe have also been pushed back significantly, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of England now not expected to begin the process of monetary tightening until early 2003. A few months ago market expectations had been that the first increases would have occurred by now. ", " While the major central banks are now not expected to tighten policy this year, central banks in several of the smaller industrial economies (where demand is stronger and the outlook for inflation is regarded as less benign) have tightened policy over the past three months (Graph 8). In addition to Australia (see chapter on <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’)</span>, the Bank of Canada has increased rates by a cumulative <span class=\"no-wrap\">75 basis points</span> to 2.75 per cent this year, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand by a cumulative 100 basis points to 5.75 per cent, and Norway's central bank increased rates in July by 50 basis points to 7 per cent (Table 2). The Swiss National Bank, on the other hand, cut policy rates in July because of concerns that the strong Swiss franc would hinder prospects for the recovery in economic growth. ", " The Bank of Japan has maintained its current policy stance over the past three months, with the reserves target remaining at <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>10–15 trillion, consistent with the BoJ's commitment to continue quantitative easing until prices are no longer declining in annual terms. ", " In general, short-term interest rates in Asian emerging markets have drifted lower over the past three months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 9)</span>. The Bank of Indonesia cut official rates by a total of 150 basis points to 13.6 per cent, reflecting slowing inflation and continued strength in the rupiah, while the Bank of Taiwan eased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> to <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.9 per cent</span>. In contrast, the Bank of Korea increased rates by 25 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.25 per cent</span> in May, citing increased concerns about inflation. ", " In Latin America, short-term rates have risen in several countries, with ongoing turmoil in Argentina, and increasing exchange rate pressures in Brazil and Uruguay. ", " Long-term government bond yields in the major economies have fallen significantly over recent months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 10)</span>. Yields on US 10-year government debt have declined by around 80 basis points since the end of April to 4.3 per cent, close to levels seen only twice since the 1960s (at the time of the Long-Term Capital Management crisis in 1998 and in the weeks following September 11 last year). The falls were driven by concerns about the economic outlook in the face of the sharp decline in share prices, as well as safe-haven demand in the wake of governance issues in US companies. There has been a very strong correlation between US share prices and US bond yields over the past few years (Graph 11). ", " Stock market weakness and concerns over the economic outlook have also contributed to falls in European bond yields over the past three months. Yields on 10-year government bonds fell by around 60 basis points in Germany, France and the UK, to levels around 4.6 per cent. ", " Yields on Japanese government bonds also fell, declining by around 10 basis points to below 1.3 per cent. The decline in yields appeared to mainly reflect concerns about the outlook for the global economy, with little impact from expectations of further bond issuance beyond the government's self-imposed <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>30 trillion cap. The long-expected downgrade of Japan's credit rating by Moody's (by two notches to A2) had little impact on yields. ", " The increasing risk aversion that has been reflected in declines in global equity markets has also contributed to significant increases in the yield spreads on lower-rated bonds. The spread between low-rated US corporate ‘junk’ bonds and 10-year Treasuries increased by around 300 basis points, which took it back to the high levels seen during the recession last year. The spread between BBB-rated corporate bonds and Treasuries increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">60 basis points</span> to its highest level since the early 1980s (Graph 12). ", " Emerging market yield spreads have also widened over the past three months (Graph 13). Yield spreads on Asian emerging market sovereigns were the least affected, with average spreads widening by less than 100 basis points, in part reflecting perceptions of improving creditworthiness in the region. Indeed, both Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch have upgraded Korea's credit rating in recent months, following Moody's earlier upgrade. In contrast, European emerging market spreads have widened on average by around 150 basis points in recent months. ", " The largest increases in emerging market spreads were seen in Latin America, where the average spread widened by a further 500 basis points (Graph 14). Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay were most affected, with increases in spreads of about 2,100 basis points, 1,100 basis points, and 800 basis points, respectively. In Argentina, there are still no signs of a package of measures to stabilise the economy following the abandonment of the currency board in January and the subsequent sharp depreciation of the peso. In Brazil, the increase in spreads has largely reflected uncertainty over the upcoming presidential elections and the related possibility of changes to the strong economic policies seen in recent years. The problems in Uruguay are largely the result of contagion from the crisis in Argentina, which has weakened the Uruguayan economy and financial system, forcing the authorities to freeze some bank deposits following the sharp depreciation of the Uruguayan currency. Uruguay was previously one of the few Latin American countries to carry an investment-grade credit rating but has been downgraded by all three major agencies in recent months. Spreads on both Brazilian and Uruguayan debt narrowed, however, in early August following the announcement of fresh financial support packages from the IMF. ", " Sentiment towards the US dollar deteriorated further over the past three months, with the trade-weighted value of the currency falling to levels that are about 8 per cent below the peak in January earlier this year (Graph 15). Equity market weakness, the reassessment of the strength of the US economy, fears of terrorism, and concerns over corporate profitability and accounting irregularities all contributed to the weakness in the US dollar. The recent fall is significant, but it reverses only part of the very strong rise that had taken place in earlier years. In trade-weighted terms, the US currency still remains nearly 20 per cent above its average level in the first half of the 1990s. ", " The decline in the US dollar over the past three months was relatively broad-based, with the currency falling by <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> against the euro and Swiss franc, 7 per cent against the yen, and 5 per cent against the pound sterling (Graph 16). The euro returned to parity against the US dollar for the first time since February 2000, although it has subsequently slipped back below. The fall against the yen prompted significant intervention by the Japanese authorities during the past three months in an effort to slow the currency's rise against the US dollar. ", " Most Asian currencies also strengthened against the US dollar over the past three months. In contrast, Latin American currencies were mostly down on economic and political uncertainty in the region. The Argentinean peso continued to depreciate, and has lost three-quarters of its value since the peg with the US dollar was abandoned in January 2002 (Graph 17), while the Brazilian real fell by more than 30 per cent against the US dollar on uncertainty about the forthcoming election, before recovering somewhat on news of IMF assistance. In Uruguay, the effects of the Argentine crisis on domestic financial stability forced the authorities to float the Uruguayan peso on 20 June, and the currency has fallen 25 per cent from its earlier level. ", " Weakness in the Australian dollar in June and July saw a reversal of most of the appreciation that had taken place in the first five months of 2002 (Graph 18). For the year to date, the currency is broadly unchanged in <span class=\"no-wrap\">trade-weighted</span> terms, though it is up around 5 per cent against a weakening US dollar. ", " The fortunes of the Australian dollar in 2002 have apparently been very closely tied to market expectations for the global economy. Through the first five months of the year, many investors bought Australian dollars in anticipation of global economic recovery. Other currencies seen by markets as sensitive to the state of the world economy also strengthened during this period. The Australian dollar was one of the most favoured, however, because the domestic economy was already doing well, the share market had remained robust, and interest rates were both higher and expected to increase more than those in the major countries. ", " Buying of Australian dollars during this period was widespread. As the rise progressed, some of the more speculative short-term traders joined what they perceived to be an upward trend. Substantial long positions in Australian dollar futures contracts on the International Money Market in Chicago were built up during this period. There were also reports that Australian funds managers were hedging some of their offshore investments in bonds and equities. ", " In the event, the Australian dollar appreciated to about US57.5 cents in early June, about 13 per cent higher than its level at the start of 2002. The rise in trade-weighted terms was less, as part of this rise against the US dollar was a reflection of US dollar weakness, and so the Australian dollar was rising less against other major <span class=\"no-wrap\">currencies (Graph 19)</span>. Nonetheless, the trade-weighted index rose to 54.1, or around 8 per cent above its level at the start of the year. ", " The questioning of the global growth outlook that has followed the recent falls in share prices has resulted in a substantial part of these long positions in Australian dollars being reversed. The currency has fallen to around US53.6 cents and 50.1 in trade-weighted terms. The Canadian and New Zealand dollars also experienced substantial corrections during this period. Domestic events in Australia seemed to have had little bearing on the recent falls; data on the Australian economy have remained robust and the share market has continued to outperform those overseas. ", " One source of overseas demand for the Australian dollar that has remained strong through this period was the Japanese household sector. Issuance of A$ Uridashi bonds (bonds sold directly to Japanese retail investors) was a record $2.4 billion in July (Graph 20). This followed issues of $3.1 billion in the first half of 2002. ", " The Bank's purchases of foreign reserves and earnings on reserves over the past three months have more than covered its sales of foreign currency to the Government. At the end of July, net reserves stood at $10.4 billion, compared with $7.7 billion at the end of April. Swaps outstanding are currently $28 billion, compared with <span class=\"no-wrap\">$27 billion</span> at the end of April. ", " In contrast to developments in financial markets, the global economy expanded moderately during the first <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of 2002</span>. In the US and much of non-Japan Asia this has been largely driven by gains in domestic demand, whereas in the euro area and Japan, a pick-up in exports has been the main source of growth. Consensus forecasts from early July suggest that growth in most of the G7 and other Asian countries was expected to be around trend over the remainder of 2002. The risks to the global recovery, however, have increased, as the large falls in stock markets across the world have raised uncertainty about the strength and durability of the recovery. Against this background and in the context of low inflation, policy settings in most countries have generally remained highly expansionary. ", " US GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the June quarter, to be 2.1 per cent higher over the year (Graph 21). Revisions to the national accounts data indicate that GDP growth last year was significantly weaker than previously reported, with declines in GDP in the first three quarters of 2001, before recovering in the December quarter. As a result, the recession is now deeper than previously thought, though it remains shallower than that in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 1990s</span>. The recovery in output has been largely concentrated in higher consumption and investment spending by households and the public sector (Table 3). In contrast, business investment has fallen for seven quarters to be 12 per cent below its peak in the September quarter 2000. Inventories contributed to growth in the June quarter, with the level of stocks increasing for the first time in 18 months and the stock-to-sales ratio was at an historic low. While exports increased in the first half of 2002, import growth was considerably stronger over this period. ", " The softening in aggregate consumption growth in the June quarter reflected continued weakness in the labour market and the associated low growth in household incomes (Graph 22). The unemployment rate has been hovering at just under 6 per cent in recent months, 2 percentage points higher than its most recent trough in late 2000 (Graph 23). While there were small increases in employment in the past three months, employment is still 1.3 per cent below its peak in March 2001. The increase in employment so far has been concentrated in certain parts of the service sector (such as temporary help supply, health, education and local government), while reductions in employment have continued in the manufacturing sector, and employment in the retail sector has also declined more recently. ", " Despite the uncertainty from the falling stock market and corporate accounting issues that have dominated financial markets in the US, activity in the business sector has continued to improve in recent months; manufacturing production and capital imports are both well above levels reached at the end of 2001, and despite falling sharply in July, the ISM measure of manufacturers' sentiment is higher than levels at the beginning of the year. In line with these more positive indicators of business activity, there was a slight rise in the equipment component of business investment in the June quarter – the first rise in 18 months. However, overall business investment declined, driven by another large fall in investment in structures. ", " Consumer price inflation was 1.1 per cent over the year to June and, excluding food and energy, the core measure of inflation slowed to 2.3 per cent (Graph 24). The divergence between goods and services inflation remains marked, with core goods prices falling by around 1 per cent over the year and services prices increasing by 3.7 per cent. The national accounts measure of core inflation was 1.6 per cent over the year to the June quarter. Consistent with the weaker labour market, wage outcomes have continued to drift lower over the past twelve months, with the wages component of the employment cost index around 3½ per cent higher over the year to June. Producer price inflation has remained low, and unit labour cost growth has remained subdued as productivity has risen rapidly. ", " Policy settings in the US remain expansionary. Interest rates are at historically low levels while tax cuts and discretionary increases in government outlays introduced over the past year have also been stimulatory. These fiscal measures, combined with the effects of slower growth, have led to a projected change in this year's budget balance of around 2¾ per cent of GDP. ", " Conditions in Canada have strengthened since the beginning of the year, as growth in employment has increased, and robust activity has continued in the manufacturing and housing sectors. In response to the stronger-than-anticipated recovery and inflationary pressures, the Bank of Canada raised official interest rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 basis points</span>, to 2.75 per cent, in recent months. ", " For the first time in nearly a year, the Japanese economy recorded strong GDP growth, increasing by 1.4 per cent in the March quarter, but output remains 1.6 per cent lower over the year (Table 4). Much of the pick-up in the March quarter was externally driven, with a sharp rise in exports providing half the growth in the quarter. The increase in output recorded in the March quarter probably overstates the turnaround in the economy, but there are a few signs that things may be improving. ", " These signs are most evident in the business sector. The Tankan survey suggests that business conditions, especially in manufacturing, improved substantially in the June quarter. The growth in exports has supported the manufacturing sector (Graph 25), and while ITC production has grown most rapidly, production of other goods has also risen in recent months. Nonetheless, business investment fell again in the March quarter, and investment intentions as measured by the Tankan survey remain soft. ", " While the national accounts measure of private consumption rose strongly in the March quarter, prospects for consumption are less promising, as conditions in the labour market have continued to deteriorate. Total employment fell by just over 1 per cent over the first half of 2002, and the unemployment rate has remained at around its historical high at 5½ per cent. Deflation appears to have moderated, as a pick-up in goods prices has reduced the annual deflation rate to 0.7 per cent over the year to June. ", " Economic growth in the region continued to improve, with output rising robustly for a second consecutive quarter in the March quarter (Table 5). Growth was bolstered in many countries by a recovery in domestic demand, reflecting stronger household consumption and a revival in investment spending. External demand also continued to pick up, in particular for ITC products. Overall, exports from non-Japan Asia rose by 10 per cent in the March quarter, though they remained 4¼ per cent lower than a year ago. The pick-up in output was particularly pronounced in Korea, which along with China, continues to exhibit stronger economic outcomes than elsewhere. ", " In line with the more balanced mix of external and domestic growth, aggregate output from the manufacturing and services industries recorded strong growth into 2002, but the construction industry continues to <span class=\"no-wrap\">languish (Graph 26)</span>. In recent months industrial production has continued to rise in most countries to a level around the peak in the second half of 2000. ", " Labour markets have improved across the region in recent months, especially for the major ITC producing countries. The Korean labour market continues to outperform the rest of the region, with employment growing rapidly and the unemployment rate currently at 3 per cent, but in Hong Kong the unemployment rate has risen during the past 1½ years and is now 1¼ percentage points higher than its previous peak experienced in <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 1999</span>. Consumer price inflation has fallen in most countries as local currencies have appreciated against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> and oil prices have moderated in recent months. China and Hong Kong continue to experience deflation in year-ended terms. ", " The New Zealand economy grew by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter, and by 4.0 per cent over the past year. Exports continued to make a contribution to growth, though less so than in previous quarters. With inflation remaining towards the top of the target range, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand increased the official cash rate a further 50 basis points in recent months to 5.75 per cent. ", " Conditions in the euro area improved in the first half of 2002, with output in the March quarter returning to positive growth, although at a tepid pace. A strong contribution from the external sector more than offset continued weakness in domestic demand. After increasing in the early part of the year, the improvement in <span class=\"no-wrap\">euro area industrial</span> production has paused in recent months (Graph 27), with particularly weak outcomes in Germany and Italy, though this was due partly to industrial disruptions. Similarly, there has also been a pause in the upward trend in business sentiment. ", " Despite the earlier economic slowdown and the soft-paced recovery, the labour market has remained relatively resilient, with the unemployment rate in the June quarter only 0.3 percentage points above its recent trough. Growth in household consumption, however, has been weak, particularly in Germany where employment has declined since the June quarter last year. Consumer sentiment has picked up from its cyclical trough, but remains well below levels reached in recent years. ", " Euro area inflation has slowed in recent months to a year-ended rate of 1.9 per cent in July (Graph 28), partly reflecting the unwinding of past increases in food and oil prices. Year-ended core inflation (which excludes food and energy) remains around 2½ per cent, having crept up over the last two years. While services inflation has picked up to around 3¼ per cent, core goods inflation is currently 1½ per cent. The pick-up in core inflation over recent years has coincided with an acceleration in labour costs, and the outcomes in German wage negotiations this year suggest further upward pressure. However, the recent appreciation of the euro is likely to provide some offsetting disinflationary effect through lower import prices. Fiscal policy in some countries has limited room for manoeuvre, as current budget positions are close to, or above the constraints set by the Stability and Growth Pact. The overall impact of fiscal policy across the region in 2002 is broadly neutral. ", " In the United Kingdom, GDP picked up strongly in the June quarter, increasing by 0.9 per cent after barely rising in the two previous quarters. The manufacturing sector has weakened further in the June quarter, but the services sector continued to pick up, consistent with continued strength in household spending. Retail sales remain nearly 6 per cent higher over the year, buoyed by rapid growth in house prices and a low interest rate environment which has encouraged consumers to withdraw equity from their homes. While the unemployment rate has remained at historically low levels, inflation (excluding mortgage payments) has slowed to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> in year-ended terms. The fiscal stance this year is expansionary, with the change in the budget position equivalent to around 1 percentage point of GDP, and a further, albeit milder, expansion is projected for next year. ", " The Australian economy has continued to grow at a healthy pace over the past year. According to the latest national accounts, real GDP expanded by 4.2 per cent over the year to the March quarter, the fifth consecutive quarterly advance of around 1 per cent (Graph 29). Domestic demand has accounted for all of the growth over this period, whereas the external sector has been adversely affected by the downturn in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">global economy in 2001 (Table 6)</span>. ", " The outlook for the domestic economy continues to be positive, although the composition of growth is likely to alter with a decline in dwelling investment in prospect later in the year. Growth in consumption spending should remain firm, buoyed by ongoing employment growth and associated increases in household incomes, as well as a high level of consumer confidence. While the recent volatility in equity markets may cause some businesses to reconsider their investment plans, conditions generally remain conducive to the pick-up in investment projected by the business surveys. Business confidence is at levels normally associated with a strongly growing economy, additions to the capital stock have been relatively small over the past few years, corporate profitability remains high and the cost of business finance is relatively low. ", " Household consumption spending has grown strongly over the past year, with retail sales volumes increasing by 2½ per cent in the June quarter and by 6¼ per cent over the year (Table 7). The pick-up in growth over the year was particularly noticeable in spending on goods. In part, this has reflected the upward phase of the housing cycle, which has increased demand for household furnishings and other goods. Sales of motor vehicles to households, which are not included in the retail trade survey, have also increased strongly in the first half of 2002, to be 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. Growth in spending on services, which has tended to grow faster than expenditure on goods over the past decade, has slowed, owing mainly to ongoing weakness in travel-related spending. ", " A number of factors remain broadly supportive of growth in consumption. Consumer sentiment, as reported by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute, remains at a high level (Graph 30). There should be only a modest drag on household spending power from increases in petrol prices – after rising earlier in the year, petrol prices have been fairly steady over the past few months. Household disposable income is likely to be supported in the period ahead by ongoing growth in employment and wages. ", " Growth in consumption has continued to be supported by borrowing by the household sector (Graph 31). Over the year to June, credit extended to the household sector rose by around 17 per cent, compared with a rise of 13 per cent over the previous year. While much of this borrowing relates to the recovery in dwelling investment, it seems likely that some of the funds borrowed against housing are being used to fund consumption. An ABS housing survey reported that in 1999, more than 30 per cent of home owners with a mortgage used some of the funds for purposes other than housing. ", " Rising house prices have also facilitated equity withdrawal through products such as home-equity loans. In addition, borrowers can access equity through redraw facilities, by borrowing more than is required to cover the cost of a new dwelling, or by refinancing existing loans and increasing the principal outstanding. The value of approvals for refinancing home loans to owner-occupiers with another lender has increased at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">29 per cent</span> over the past two years. Much of the refinancing activity is likely to reflect the desire to obtain preferable loan conditions or to consolidate loans, but obtaining some funding for consumption is also common. According to the ABS housing survey, around 20 per cent of borrowers refinancing home loans over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">period 1997–99</span> used some of the proceeds to fund purchases such as cars and holidays. (For a discussion of related issues see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>: Developments in Household Balance Sheets.) ", " With growth in household debt outpacing that of disposable income, the debt-to-income ratio has continued to rise, but debt servicing was little changed in the March quarter at around 5¾ per cent of disposable income <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 32)</span>. The cumulative 50 basis point tightening in monetary policy in the June quarter will affect cash flows of a number of households in the months ahead. The main direct effect will be via higher interest charges for households with variable-rate home loans (around one-quarter of households) and those paying off other types of variable-rate consumer debt. The effect of higher home loan interest rates will be absorbed to some extent by a number of households reducing the excess principal repayments they had been making over the past year or so by keeping their monthly payments constant as interest rates declined through 2001. ", " It is difficult to determine how the recent fall in global equity markets will affect consumer spending in Australia. At this stage the fall in equity wealth seems likely to be less of a drag on the household sector in Australia than in the United States or Europe, since the fall in Australian equity markets has been much smaller. The total gains in wealth in recent years have been very large and the ratio of wealth to income is at an historically high level, as the increase in house prices over the past year has more than offset the fall in share prices. Nonetheless, it is possible that increased volatility in share prices could adversely affect consumer sentiment and this could weaken consumer spending. ", " Conditions in the housing sector remain buoyant, though some leading indicators of dwelling activity presage a weakening in dwelling investment later in the year. Dwelling commencements declined in the March quarter, following sharp increases in the previous two quarters, while the number of loan approvals to owner-occupiers for new construction has fallen by 24 per cent from its January peak (Graph 33). Building approvals data, however, remain at a high level, suggesting that the downturn in the dwelling sector could occur later than previously expected. The number of building approvals for houses, after declining gradually over the early part of this year, rose again in June and was back around levels recorded in the second half of 2001, although approvals in <span class=\"no-wrap\">May and June</span> may have been boosted by first-home buyers obtaining approvals before the expiration of the Commonwealth Additional Grant (CAG) (Graph 34). Since a number of first-home buyers have brought forward decisions to build new dwellings as a result of the grant, their absence from the market in the future will amplify the expected downturn in the housing cycle; the cessation of the CAG, however, should have a much smaller effect on the dwelling cycle than the introduction of the GST, since the CAG affects only first-home buyers purchasing new homes. Furthermore, given extensions to both the required commencement and completion dates for recipients of the grant, there can be a significant lag between the approval of a grant and its effect on building activity. ", " Building approvals for medium-density housing have been particularly strong, reaching a record high for this cycle in April. This accords with the strong rise in the value of investor loan approvals in recent months, particularly for new construction. (For a further discussion of housing see ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2002/jul/1.html\">Recent Developments in Housing:   Prices, Finance and Investor Attitudes</a>’ in the July 2002 <cite>Bulletin</cite>.) ", " The strong growth in house prices in recent years continued in the March quarter. According to both the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA)</span> and the ABS, capital city house prices rose by around 4 per cent in the March quarter and by 17 per cent over the year to March (Table 8). The increases across capital cities over the past year have been relatively uniform, according to the REIA data, with all state capitals experiencing double-digit growth. Nonetheless, there is some evidence of excess supply in the housing market, particularly in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">medium-density</span> area. Residential property vacancy rates have moved higher in a number of capital cities over the past year. ", " Businesses have, on average, experienced quite favourable conditions over the past year or so, although outcomes have varied across sectors (Graph 35). Growth in the goods production and distribution sectors has picked up, as evidenced by robust growth in the construction, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and transport and storage industries. In contrast, growth in the services sectors has slowed markedly from its very high rate in 2000. Reduced discretionary spending by firms has affected demand for a range of business services, such as consulting, marketing and computing services. Growth in services supplied to households has also eased, largely reflecting subdued demand for tourism services and slower growth in the provision of health services, as the number of private health fund members has levelled out. ", " Indicators of business conditions generally improved in the June quarter, continuing the upward trend in evidence since the beginning of last year (Graph 36). According to the broad-based NAB quarterly business survey, business conditions were strongest in domestically oriented sectors, such as the retail, wholesale and construction sectors, while conditions in the sectors exposed to the international economy were somewhat weaker. The ACCI-Westpac survey also reported an improvement in business conditions for the manufacturing sector in the June quarter, consistent with the strength in housing investment and the pick-up in goods consumption; the new orders component of the survey also improved further, with the share of respondents nominating ‘insufficient new orders’ as a constraint on production falling to its lowest level in two years. Measures of business confidence in most business surveys remain at quite high levels, notwithstanding some decline in the June quarter. ", " The outlook for the farm sector, which is not covered by any of the major business surveys, has deteriorated in recent months, with a number of regions currently experiencing drier conditions than normal and some chance that these conditions will persist until at least the end of this year. The rainfall shortages in the past three months have been particularly acute in northern New South Wales, central and southern Queensland and in parts of the wheat belt in Western Australia. Rainfall in South Australia, Tasmania and parts of Victoria in this period has been closer to average levels. While the agriculture industry accounts for about 3 per cent of total output, the large swing in rural incomes that is normally associated with dry conditions can have a noticeable effect on economic growth, largely through lower rural exports, and also indirectly via the flow-on effects of weaker farm incomes to other sectors of the economy (for further details on rural exports see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#balance-of-payments\">Balance of Payments</a>’). ", " Corporate profits, as measured by gross operating surplus (GOS), rose by just over 4½ per cent in the March quarter to be nearly 9 per cent higher over the year (Graph 37). The increase over the past year reflects improvements in the profitability of domestically oriented industries. In contrast, mining profits edged a little lower over the period, reflecting falls in some metals prices, moderating export volumes and the appreciation of the Australian dollar, although the level of mining profits remains high by historical standards. The small-business sector has also benefited from strong domestic activity, particularly in retail sales and residential construction, with profits increasing by around 12 per cent over the year to the March quarter. More recently, business surveys have reported a generally favourable outlook for profits. ", " Firms also have ready access to funds, with external fundraising by businesses picking up in the first half of 2002 compared with the second half of 2001. The largest turnaround in external financing has been in business credit, which grew at an annualised rate of 6½ per cent over the six months to June, compared with an annualised decline of nearly 3 per cent over the previous six months. Growth in non-intermediated debt raisings has also been firm, mainly reflecting long-term bond issuance by a number of larger corporates. With share prices near historical highs in the early part of the year, equity raisings continued at a rapid pace, predominantly through institutional placements rather than new floats. These raisings may have slowed more recently, however, in line with weakness in the equity market. ", " The aggregate financial health of the corporate sector remains sound. Debt levels are quite low by historical standards. As a result of the very subdued growth in business credit towards the end of last year, and the low level of interest rates, the interest burden as a share of profits fell to around its lowest level in 30 years in the March quarter (Graph 38). ", " The high level of business confidence, continued strength in corporate profitability in the non-farm sector and easy access to low-cost funding are all contributing to a generally favourable investment climate. After reaching a trough around the middle of 2001, business investment has increased, with investment 7 per cent higher over the six months to the March quarter. However, levels of investment as a share of GDP remain historically low <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 39)</span>. In contrast to the pick-up in spending on machinery and equipment and buildings and structures, expenditure on mineral and petroleum exploration and computer software has declined recently. ", " The recent indicators of investment intentions for 2002/03 remain positive. According to the March quarter ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey, investment in machinery and equipment is expected to grow by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> in nominal terms in 2002/03, assuming a five-year average realisation ratio. The mining and transport sectors continue to underpin the expected growth in investment, with a sizable increase also anticipated in the property and business services sector. Spending on machinery and equipment by the manufacturing sector is expected to remain weak in 2002/03, according to the Capex survey, despite manufacturers reporting optimistic investment plans in some private-sector business surveys. ", " The Capex survey also points to rapid growth in investment spending on buildings and structures in 2002/03. This is supported by information from the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em>, which reported a sharp increase over the past year in the value of projects under construction and projects in the pipeline. The ABS building activity and engineering surveys also reported significant amounts of non-residential construction work in the pipeline, though non-residential building approvals have eased in recent months. Office and business-park construction account for a sizable share of the expected growth in building activity. While office vacancy rates have drifted higher in most capital cities over the past year or so, they remain only slightly above their historical lows. Investment will also be boosted by infrastructure spending, with a significant number of public projects earmarked for private-sector involvement by various state governments. ", " The Commonwealth Government announced its 2002/03 budget in May. The estimated underlying cash balance is a surplus of $2.1 billion, compared with a deficit of $1.2 billion in 2001/02 (Table 9). In accrual terms, the budget is expected to be roughly in balance in 2002/03, compared with a deficit of $3.0 billion last year. New policy decisions included increased spending on defence operations, upgrading domestic security, reform of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and further welfare reform. Using the change in the underlying cash balance between financial years as an approximation of the fiscal stance, the Commonwealth budget had an expansionary impact on growth in expenditure in 2001/02 of around 1 per cent of GDP. In contrast, fiscal policy is expected to have a contractionary effect on expenditure growth this financial year of around ½ per cent of GDP. On the same basis, the combined fiscal impact from the states is likely to have been broadly neutral in 2001/02, but is expected to be slightly expansionary in 2002/03. ", " Labour market conditions remain favourable, supported by robust growth in economic activity. Employment growth has slowed, after a surge in the first part of the year, but employment is 1¾ per cent higher in the three months to July than in the corresponding period a year earlier. Full-time employment was flat in the past three months but part-time employment rose, continuing the strong upward trend of recent years (Graph 40). Consistent with the gains in employment over the first half of the year, the unemployment rate has fallen from its recent peak of 7.0 per cent in January to 6.2 per cent in July. Average weekly hours worked rose slightly in the June quarter, following a sizable increase in the March quarter. ", " Queensland and South Australia have experienced the fastest employment growth over the year to the three months to July, of 2.7 and 2.5 per cent respectively (Table 10). In contrast, employment growth has eased in Victoria after a two-year period in which job generation had tended to outpace that in the rest of Australia. The unemployment rate has risen slightly in New South Wales and Tasmania in the past year, consistent with the slower employment growth in those states. ", " In line with the pattern of growth of the domestic economy, strong increases in employment have been recorded in the construction and retail and wholesale trade industries over the past year (Table 11). Employment in the manufacturing and property and business services industries also rose in the first half of 2002, though employment in both these industries is still below levels of a year ago. Industries that had been most exposed to the downturn in tourism, such as accommodation, cafes and restaurants, and cultural and recreational services, experienced robust growth in the first half of this year, though employment in the transport and storage industry, which includes airline travel, remained weak. ", " With output growth maintaining its robust pace in the year to the March quarter and the labour market strengthening, growth in output per person employed increased by 2½ per cent over the year. On an <span class=\"no-wrap\">hours-worked</span> basis, the increase over the year was somewhat stronger at 3¾ per cent. This is well above the average growth in this series over the past decade of about 2¼ per cent (Graph 41). ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand point towards further employment gains. While slowing recently, vacancies data are well above their troughs in late 2001 (Graph 42). The ANZ newspaper-based measure of job advertisements has increased by 1 per cent in the three months to July and is now 8 per cent higher over the year. The level of skilled vacancies, as measured by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), has also risen in recent months, and is 4 per cent higher over the year to July. The ABS employer-based measure of vacancies rose by 9 per cent in the June quarter, and has recovered more than half the 23 per cent fall experienced during 2001. While most survey data report a slight easing in hiring intentions for the September quarter, they remain around or above long-run levels. ", " Reflecting Australia's faster pace of growth relative to its trading partners, the balance of trade recorded a deficit of around 1 per cent of GDP in the June quarter. On the assumption that the net income deficit as a share of GDP remained constant, the current account deficit is likely to have widened from 3.1 per cent of GDP in the March quarter to close to 4¼ per cent in the June quarter (Graph 43). ", " Exports to most markets have declined over the past year, in line with the global slowdown, with the weakness concentrated at the end of 2001. Particularly large falls were recorded in exports to Japan and the European Union <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 12)</span>. Exports to the Middle East, which increased rapidly through most of 2001, have contracted over the past six months, as the earlier buoyant trade in exports of live animals and road vehicles eased. There have, however, been some notable exceptions. Exports to Korea and New Zealand, our third and fifth largest trading partners respectively, have both risen by more than 10 per cent over the past year, reflecting the strong economic growth in these countries. ", " After rebounding in the March quarter, the value of exports fell by almost 2 per cent in the June quarter, as price falls offset a small rise in export volumes. Resource export values eased by 1¼ per cent in the June quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 44)</span>. The fall was more than accounted for by lower world commodity prices, especially spot prices for thermal coal, and the valuation effects of the appreciation of the Australian dollar over the first half of this year. Lower base metals prices also contributed to a fall in the value of metals exported in the quarter. Exports of mineral fuels, however, grew strongly. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecasts that the value of energy exports will fall in 2002/03, partly because some of Australia's mature oil fields are approaching the end of their productive lives and because of lower contract thermal coal prices <span class=\"no-wrap\">(see ‘<a href=\"#cp\">Commodity prices</a>’ section)</span>. However, exports of metals are expected to grow strongly in 2002/03, as the large increases in mining investment over the past year and a half expand the production capacity of mines. ", " The value of rural exports fell slightly in the June quarter, to be almost 10 per cent lower than a year earlier. As with resource exports, falling prices in Australian dollars for rural commodities offset a substantial rise in rural export volumes in the June quarter. In the June quarter there was a sharp increase in grain exports, as the large winter crop harvested over the Christmas period began to be exported, and a 2.3 per cent rise in the value of wool exports, boosted by higher prices. Beef exports were steady in the first half of the year, with lower prices more than offset by strong growth in export volumes to most of our major markets. ", " A number of factors are likely to curtail growth in Australia's rural exports in the period ahead. Drier conditions, particularly in NSW, which accounts for about one-third of Australia's grain production, southern Queensland and parts of Western Australia, will limit the size of the grain crop and bring forward livestock slaughtering. Wheat exports may also be affected if Iraq reduces its Australian wheat shipments. The recent signing of the US <span class=\"no-wrap\"><em>Farm Security and Rural Investment Act</em></span> of 2002 (the 2002 US farm bill) will significantly increase the level of support to US farmers. This is expected to result in an increase in US production – especially of grains, oilseeds, cotton and dairy products – and lower world prices for these products. ", " The steepest falls in the value of exports in the June quarter were in manufactured goods, which contracted by about 3¼ per cent, partly reflecting weak trading-partner growth – a key driver of manufactured exports – and valuation effects from the rise in the Australian dollar exchange rate (Graph 45). The fall was broad-based, though the decline in the June quarter was particularly sharp for exports of machinery. Service exports have also been adversely affected by slow growth in world output and international trade. This is most evident in the lower export earnings from tourism and transportation services. Overall, the value of service exports in the June quarter fell by just over 1 per cent, to be more than 2 per cent lower over the year. ", " Robust growth in domestic demand has continued to spur demand for imports. The volume of imports is estimated to have risen by over 5 per cent in the June quarter, to be about 10 per cent higher than a year ago. Over the same period, the value of imports has risen at a slower pace, because of lower import prices and the appreciation of the exchange rate. The biggest increases in the quarter were in a range of consumption goods, notably cars and household electrical items, reflecting the strength in domestic sales of motor vehicles and household goods. In total, the value of consumption imports rose by around 5¾ per cent in the June quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 46)</span>. Capital imports rose by 3½ per cent over the same period, predominantly due to increased imports of telecommunication equipment, and are 15 per cent higher than a year earlier. Consistent with the appreciation of the exchange rate over the first half of the year, a recovery in imports of travel services is estimated to have contributed to a significant rise in the volume of service imports in the June quarter. ", " The net income deficit in the March quarter widened slightly, to be just above 3 per cent of GDP. Relative to GDP, the deficit has remained broadly stable over the past four years, as lower global interest rates have offset the higher level of net foreign liabilities. Australia's net foreign liabilities increased slightly in the March quarter to <span class=\"no-wrap\">$421 billion</span>, or 60 per cent of GDP (Graph 47). This primarily reflected a rise in net foreign debt to 47½ per cent of GDP, as net inflows of debt again significantly outpaced those of equity, consistent with the trend of subdued net equity outflows over the past few years. ", " Around the middle of the year, most major Australian resource contract price negotiations were concluded. This year coking coal contract prices to Japan increased by around 13 per cent, the second successive annual increase. However, contract thermal coal and iron ore prices fell. The thermal coal reference price was cut by 7.7 per cent, in part reflecting increased competition from China and Indonesia (Graph 48). Contract prices for iron ore were also cut, with iron ore fines prices reduced by 2.4 per cent and iron ore lump prices by 5 per cent. ", " Prices for most other commodities produced in Australia have fallen in recent months, to reverse most of the gains recorded in the March quarter. The RBA Commodity Price Index declined by 2.7 per cent in SDR terms and by around 4.8 per cent in Australian dollar terms in the past three months (Table 13 and Graph 49). Most rural commodities have recorded price falls, albeit from high levels. Beef and veal prices have been under downward pressure as dry conditions have led to increased slaughtering of cattle, and as demand for beef in Japan has slumped following a further case of ‘mad-cow’ disease in the Japanese herd. Despite rising recently, sugar prices remain at low levels because of heavy international selling and an expected record high in Brazilian production, the world's largest sugar producer and trader. ", " Wheat prices continued to rise in July, because of lower-than-expected yields from crops planted in the US, Canada and Russia. Tight supply conditions have also contributed to higher wool prices, which are 17 per cent higher than a year ago. ", " Base metals prices fell by 5.1 per cent in the three months to July, after rising earlier in the year and were more than 9 per cent lower than a year earlier. The general weakness in base metals prices over the past year reflects the lacklustre growth in world industrial production. Prices of other resources have generally also fallen since the beginning of the year. A combination of geopolitical tensions and financial market instability, particularly in the US, drove the gold price to a four-year, intra-day peak above US$330 per ounce in early June. Since then, the gold price has fallen, but still remains above US$300 per ounce. Oil prices have been volatile in recent months, but have generally remained around the middle of the OPEC target band (Graph 50). ", " Despite recent falls, over the past couple of years commodity prices have risen significantly, along with other non-commodity export prices. Over the same period, import prices have risen at a slower pace, and have declined since the second half of last year, partly reflecting the steep and steady falls in the prices of ICT equipment. As a consequence of these trends, Australia's terms of trade have steadily improved to be around their highest level since the early 1990s. ", " At the time of the increase in the target cash rate from 4.25 to 4.50 per cent in early May, the money market had priced-in several further increases, totalling 75 basis points, by the end of the year. Market expectations for increases in the cash rate rose further in the weeks leading up to the June tightening of policy. Not only was the June tightening fully expected, but a further 100 basis points were factored in for the balance of the year. This was consistent with an end-year target cash rate of 5.75 per cent (Graph 51). This change in outlook was underpinned by ongoing strong domestic economic news and improving sentiment about the global recovery. ", " Over the following two months, however, expectations for the target cash rate were revised progressively lower. By early August, the money market was expecting no change until well into 2003. This reassessment was driven predominately by developments offshore and in particular by weakness in foreign equity markets. Market participants became increasingly concerned that the weakness in global equity markets, if protracted, could threaten recovery in the US economy and ultimately constrain the domestic economic outlook. ", " The turnaround in money market interest rates has been mirrored further out the yield curve. Yields on <span class=\"no-wrap\">medium- and long-term</span> Australian government bonds rose early in the quarter. The 3-year bond yield rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 basis points</span> to over 6.00 per cent and the 10-year bond yield by 20 basis points to 6.30 per cent between end April and early June (Graph 52). Bond yields then fell sharply. By early August, 3-year bond yields had declined around 100 basis points to 5.05 per cent. The yield on 10-year bonds had fallen 70 basis points to 5.60 per cent. These falls took bond yields back to their levels at the start of the year. ", " While the rise in bond yields in May was more a reflection of the domestic economic news and revisions to policy expectations, the decline over the past two months has been predominantly and increasingly a response to the sharp falls in US equity valuations and the associated fall in US bond yields. The fall in Australian yields was more muted than that in the US, reflecting the greater resilience of the Australian share market and economy. ", " The spread between 10-year Australian and US bond yields has widened noticeably in recent months; in early August, it was close to 130 basis points compared with 100 basis points at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 53)</span>. ", " Since end April, yields on corporate bonds have not fallen as far as yields on government bonds, reflecting increased risk aversion in fixed-interest markets. Spreads on bonds rated BBB widened the most, following a profit warning from one domestic retailer (Graph 54). Spreads on bonds rated A and AA have also risen sharply. These categories of bonds include a number of US financial institutions which have Australian bond issues, and the rise in spreads reflected concerns about their credit quality and their relationship with Enron. In addition, the financial strength of AA-rated foreign insurers who have issued in the Australian market has been weakened by investment losses in equity markets. Nonetheless, Australian corporate bond spreads have risen by less than spreads in the US. There, concerns about the financial health of the corporate sector have caused bond spreads to increase <span class=\"no-wrap\">sharply (Graph 55)</span>. ", " The 25 basis point increases in the cash rate in May and June were passed on by banks in full to their indicator lending rates. ", " Many of these rates are now higher than in 1999 when the cash rate was also 4.75 per cent (Table 14). This reflects increases in banks' margins during the tightening in 2000 and the easing in 2001. ", " The smallest increases in margins have been for loans secured by residential property (Graph 56). Margins on mortgages have increased between 5 and 20 basis points since the beginning of 1999. Margins on personal loans secured by residential property (commonly called home equity loans) and small business term loans secured by residential property have also increased by only a small amount. ", " Other rates have shown greater increases. Credit card margins have increased by 75 basis points. Margins on small business overdrafts and loans secured by assets other than residential property have risen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">between 30</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">55 basis points</span>. Small businesses have, however, kept their average borrowing costs down by switching to lower-cost products (Graph 57). Margins on variable interest rate loans to large businesses – albeit applicable to only around a quarter of large businesses' total bank borrowings – have also risen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">around 30–50 basis points</span>. ", " Banks' fixed rates for housing and small business have fallen slightly in recent months, reflecting moves in the market yields from which these loans are priced (Graph 58). With borrowers seeking to lock-in fixed rates ahead of expected interest rate rises, the proportion of fixed-rate loans amongst new loans has risen over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span> to over 9 per cent. This proportion is still relatively low by historical standards, however, perhaps indicating that households are relatively comfortable about the risks of rises in variable rates. Also, at present, interest rates on variable-rate mortgages are still a little below those on fixed-rate mortgages (Graph 59). ", " The domestic non-government bond market saw $8.5 billion of issuance in the second quarter of 2002. This was somewhat less than the $10.5 billion issued in the previous quarter, but well in excess of maturing bonds. As such, non-government bonds outstanding in Australia rose by 6 per cent over the quarter to $116 billion. In contrast to the pattern seen in recent quarters, issuance came mostly in the form of direct, rather than asset-backed, bonds <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 60)</span>. Direct bond issuance was up 19 per cent on the previous quarter. ", " Financial institutions accounted for almost 60 per cent of direct bond issuance during the quarter (Table 15). Issuance by this group was boosted by one large issue from the domestic subsidiary of a US finance company. This issue, at $1.7 billion, was the largest single issue yet made in the Australian market. Corporate issuance, at <span class=\"no-wrap\">$2.3 billion</span>, was double that placed in the previous quarter. Property trusts and utility companies accounted for the majority of corporate issues. ", " Domestic issuance by non-residents recorded its lowest level since June 2000. A number of non-resident issuers that sounded out the Australian market in recent months deferred their planned issues because the cost of raising funds in Australia relative to their home markets had risen in the past month or two. In the Australian market, most foreign issuers carry a AAA rating. Substantial issuance by AAA-rated domestic issuers earlier in the quarter left little appetite for such foreign issuers (Graph 61). ", " The maturity profile of bonds outstanding lengthened during the quarter as a number of domestic direct bond issuers issued long-dated bonds with the stated intention of extending the average term of their outstanding debt. Two-thirds of direct bond issues (by number) in 2002 to date have had initial maturities of five years or longer, compared with an average of 40 per cent of issues over the previous three years. ", " Offshore bond issuance by Australian institutions amounted to $15 billion in the June quarter, up 25 per cent on the March quarter. As in the domestic market, financial institutions accounted for most issuance, raising $7.8 billion, while corporate entities raised $2.4 billion. Offshore asset-backed issuance, at $5 billion, was 20 per cent lower than in the March quarter. As in the domestic market, the reduction was entirely due to a reduction in average issue size. ", " The Australian share market has fallen less than most markets overseas. Since end April, the ASX 200 index has fallen 9 per cent, about half the decline in the US. The ASX 200 is 13 per cent below its peak in March this year, whereas broadly based US indices are more than 40 per cent below their peaks reached in the first quarter of 2000 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 62)</span>. ", " The smaller fall in the Australian market owes a lot to compositional differences compared with markets in major overseas countries (Table 16). Standard &amp; Poor's have standardised the share price indices compiled for major countries to each include 10 broad industry sectors. Consistent data for these sectoral sub-indices are available since March 2000 (around the peak in the US market). Over this period, the Australian share market has, in aggregate, held up well, falling just 3 per cent. In comparison, the UK and Canadian markets have fallen more than 30 per cent while the US and Japanese markets have declined by around 40 per cent. ", " The Australian market has performed relatively well in five of the industry sectors, recording some of the largest net increases since March 2000 (Graph 63). These sectors were financials, materials, industrials, telecommunications and health care. In contrast, it has performed badly in the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors, recording among the biggest falls. ", " Across the sectors, therefore, the performance of the Australian share market is mixed. The factor that contributes most to the relatively strong overall performance of the Australian market is the weighting of the sectors. In particular, a very large proportion (currently 44 per cent) of the Australian market consists of financial stocks (Table 16). This has been a strongly performing sector. The Australian index also has only a negligible weight in the poorly performing information technology sector. If the Australian share market had had the same sectoral weights as the US market in March 2000, it would be showing a fall of 32 per cent since then, rather than the relatively flat outcome actually recorded. ", " Analysts continue to expect robust growth in company profits in the next year or two, though expectations have been scaled back a little over the past three months. Current expectations are for a 10 per cent rise in 2002, followed by a 13 per cent increase in 2003. Growth in profits tends to be volatile from year to year, and such increases are well within historical experience, as shown in Graph 64, but would require strong growth in the economy. ", " The P/E ratio calculated on trailing, ‘as-reported’ profits has risen since late 2001, from around 20 to 27. An important factor contributing to the rise was the large losses incurred by News Corporation. Excluding this company, which has a large weight in the Australian market, the P/E ratio is 18. This is higher than average, but remains below comparable ratios for the US (Graph 65). ", " Net equity raisings for the June quarter were very strong, with non-financial companies raising $6.8 billion, more than double the amount raised in the March quarter and the strongest issuance seen in the past five years. As has been the case for the past 12 months, most raisings were through placements; initial public offerings amounted to just $1 billion. Infrastructure groups accounted for most of the funds raised through initial public offerings in the quarter. Further substantial initial public offerings from infrastructure groups are in prospect in the next month or so. There was a slight increase in buybacks during the quarter, but buybacks remain well below the levels seen in <span class=\"no-wrap\">1999 and 2000 (Graph 66)</span>. ", " Growth in margin lending for equities and managed funds continued to be strong in the June quarter (Table 17). Total margin debt grew by 10 per cent. Over the same period margin debt in the US fell 2 per cent. Growth in both the average loan size and the number of clients remains strong. The average credit limit used and average leverage rose from the low levels seen last quarter. The 3 per cent fall in the value of securities underlying margin loans accounts for much of the increase of leverage. The number of margin calls doubled over the quarter, reflecting the fall in share prices. Banks report little difficulty with customers meeting margin calls. While protected share financing (which combines a margin loan with derivative products to ensure that the value of the share portfolio backing the loan maintains its capital value) accounts for just 6 per cent of all margin lending, it grew particularly strongly in the June quarter. ", " The cash rate rose by a cumulative 50 basis points in recent months, which was reflected in similar increases in real short-term interest rates, though both nominal and real short-term interest rates remain low by historical standards. Real longer-term interest rates have declined, reflecting falls in nominal bond yields associated with increased uncertainty about the strength of the global recovery. Other indicators suggest financial conditions remain supportive of growth: the slope of the yield curve is positive; credit is readily available; and the real exchange rate, after rising over much of this year, has recently fallen back to its level at the beginning of the year. ", " The 25 basis point tightening in monetary policy in June lifted the cash rate to 4.75 per cent and took the cumulative tightening this cycle to 50 basis points. Nevertheless, the level of real interest rates remains low by historical standards. Using three different measures of inflationary expectations – underlying inflation, bond market inflation expectations and consumer inflation expectations – the real cash rate is 0.5 to 1.3 percentage points below its average over the period since 1992 (Table 18). The same calculations over the period since 1997, during which inflation has been around 2¼ per cent and output growth around 4 per cent, show that the current real rate is around ¾ of a percentage point below its average level. Longer-term real interest rates have fallen over the past three months, due to the sizable decline in nominal yields over this period, though they remain well above the lows reached in 2001. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’, variable lending rates of financial institutions have generally moved higher, in line with the cash rate, though they also remain quite low by historical standards <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 67)</span>. The gap between cash rates and variable home loan rates has remained fairly steady over the past couple of years, after narrowing quite sharply through the 1990s. In contrast, the gap between cash rates and indicator lending rates on business loans not secured by residential mortgages has widened over the same period. Fixed lending rates of financial institutions for both housing and small business have begun to fall from their recent peak in June. Yields on corporate debt have not fallen as far as yields on lower-risk government debt, though the widening in the yield differential in Australia has not been as large as in the US, where concerns about corporate financial health have resulted in a sharp increase in the gap. ", " The slope of the yield curve in Australia, as measured by the difference between the 10-year bond yield and the 90-day bank bill rate, has narrowed sharply over the past three months, reflecting both higher short-term rates and lower bond yields (Graph 68). Nonetheless, the slope remains positive, consistent with perceptions of accommodative monetary policy and continued economic growth. ", " Total credit grew at an annualised rate of 12 per cent in the six months to June, a faster pace than over the preceding six months (Graph 69). The increase mainly reflects a pick-up in business borrowing, with business credit growing at an annualised rate of 6½ per cent over the six months to June, after contracting by about 3 per cent in the second half of 2001. As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’, external fundraising by businesses has picked up in the first half of the year, consistent with improving corporate sentiment and a positive outlook for investment. ", " Growth in lending to households remains strong, with household credit in the six months to June increasing at an annualised rate of a little over 16½ per cent, compared with an annualised increase of 18 per cent over the previous six months. Borrowing by investors for housing has been particularly strong in recent months. ", " Annual growth in the broader monetary aggregates has been similar to that of credit, with M3 and broad money growing by 12.3 and 9.7 per cent respectively over the year to June (Graph 70). Over the course of the year, however, funding patterns of financial institutions have varied considerably, leading to sharp divergences in growth rates between credit and the monetary aggregates. In particular, growth in the monetary aggregates has been affected by substitution by banks between certificates of deposit and bank bills, with the latter not included in the monetary aggregates, as well as offshore borrowing by financial institutions, which is also excluded from the monetary aggregates. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar, after rising strongly over much of the first half of the year, has depreciated more recently and in trade-weighted terms is broadly unchanged over the year to date. The real exchange rate, which adjusts for inflation across our trading partners, rose by about 7 per cent over the year to the June quarter, but remained around 8 per cent below its 1990s average (Graph 71). With the current level of the real exchange rate only slightly above the historical low reached in 2000, competitive conditions for the export and import-competing sectors of the economy remain favourable. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.7 per cent in the June quarter and by 2.8 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Table 19, Graph 72)</span>. Measures of underlying inflation increased by around 0.6 per cent in the quarter, and by between 2½ and 3¼ per cent in year-ended terms, reflecting the dispersion in the various measures of underlying inflation in previous quarters (Graph 73). As noted in the May <em>Statement</em>, the exclusion-based measures of underlying inflation have been at the upper end of this range as they include some items whose prices have risen rapidly over the past year, such as holidays, and exclude others whose prices have fallen, such as petrol. The Bank's assessment is that the statistical measures of underlying inflation, which are around 2½ per cent, are currently providing a more accurate reading of underlying inflation. ", " The largest contribution to the CPI in the June quarter was made by petrol prices, which increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.5 per cent</span>, although they fell by 5.1 per cent over the year, reflecting movements in world oil prices. Other major contributors to the quarterly increase in the CPI were higher prices for hospital and medical services (largely due to higher private health insurance premiums), overseas holiday travel and higher costs of building a new home. ", " There were also a few notable price falls in the quarter. Fruit and vegetable prices fell by 5.8 per cent, to be little changed over the year. Motor vehicle prices fell by 0.9 per cent due to end-of-year discounting and the prices of audio, visual and computing items continued their ongoing decline. ", " The price of tradable goods rose by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, and by 1.8 per cent over the year. Abstracting from recent movements in oil and food prices, which have significantly affected these numbers, the price of tradable goods increased by 0.6 per cent in the quarter to be 2.1 per cent higher over the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 74)</span>. The continued easing in the rate of increase of traded goods prices suggests that the inflationary impulse from the earlier depreciation has largely dissipated. In contrast, non-tradables prices increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span> in the June quarter, having grown by around 1 per cent in each of the previous three quarters, reflecting the strength in the domestic economy. Over the year to the June quarter, non-tradables prices rose by 3.8 per cent. ", " Producer prices, which provide a measure of input costs, have remained moderate in the June quarter, as higher oil and building construction prices were offset by the effects of the exchange rate appreciation over the first half of the year. Final stage producer prices rose by 0.2 per cent in the quarter, and intermediate and preliminary stage prices increased by 0.3 and 0.7 per cent respectively (Table 20). ", " Abstracting from oil prices, the prices of imported components at all three stages of production fell by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3¼ per cent</span> in the June quarter. This is consistent with the appreciation of the exchange rate in the first half of 2002, and continuing downward pressure on world prices for goods such as electrical equipment, industrial machinery and motor vehicles. The large increases in the domestic component of preliminary producer prices in late 2000 now appear to have passed through to final producer prices. Excluding oil, the domestic component of final producer prices rose by 3 per cent over the year to the June quarter. ", " Business surveys also suggest that upstream cost pressures are subdued (Graph 75). The NAB survey reported that growth in purchase costs eased to 0.3 per cent in the June quarter and businesses expect a similar moderate rise in the September quarter. The net balance of firms experiencing cost increases in the June quarter was steady according to the ACCI-Westpac manufacturing-based survey, although the share of firms expecting a rise in costs in the September quarter increased. ", " Over the past year, different measures of labour costs have recorded a range of outcomes, in part reflecting differences in construction and scope (<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>), but in general most measures indicate that wage pressures remain contained. Recently, however, signs have emerged to suggest that the downward forces acting on wages over the past year may now have begun to abate, and some signals of upward pressures have become apparent. ", " The wage cost index (WCI) for total pay rose by 3.1 per cent over the year to the March quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 21</span>, <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph B1)</span>, down from the peak of 3.7 per cent recorded in the year to the March quarter 2001. At the industry level, the fastest wage growth according to this measure was recorded in the electricity, gas and water industry (4.6 per cent), and in the finance and insurance industry (4.0 per cent), while the slowest growth was recorded in the transport and storage industry (2.4 per cent) and the wholesale and retail trade industries (both 2.6 per cent). ", " Recent data on enterprise bargaining agreements from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations also indicate that the pace of wage growth remains moderate. New federal enterprise agreements ratified in the March quarter granted an average annualised wage increase of 3.6 per cent, although this outcome partly reflected an unusually high representation of retail sector agreements certified in the quarter, which are typically at the lower end of the wage growth spectrum. The average annualised wage increase for renegotiated private sector agreements in March was 3.4 per cent, which is the same as the agreements they replaced. Wage increases for the stock of existing agreements have edged up over the past year or so, but remain relatively moderate at 3.8 per cent. According to the latest Mercer <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em>, executives' base salaries rose by 4.6 per cent over the year to June, which was unchanged from the previous quarter. Growth in the salaries of office-based workers was also unchanged at 4.0 per cent. ", " In contrast to other wage indicators, average weekly ordinary-time earnings of full-time adults (AWOTE) continue to record strong growth. AWOTE grew by 1.5 per cent in the March quarter, and by 6.2 per cent over the year. Compensation per hour in the national accounts over the same period has risen by 5.3 per cent. On a per employee basis, however, compensation has risen by 3.7 per cent, the difference reflecting a decline in average hours worked. The corresponding measure of growth in unit labour costs based on compensation per hour worked picked up slightly over the year to March, but still remains subdued. ", " Total labour costs reported in the NAB survey increased modestly in the June quarter, and firms expect labour cost growth to pick up in the September quarter to levels close to the average over the past 10 years. According to the NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys firms have also reported greater difficulty attracting suitable labour. ", " In its Safety Net Review decision, announced on 9 May, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission granted an $18 per week wage increase across all award rates of pay. Consequently, the federal minimum wage rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.4 per cent</span> to $431.40 per week. ", " Inflation expectations of consumers, as measured by the Melbourne Institute survey, have remained in a range between 3½ and 4½ per cent since mid 2000 (Graph 76). Expectations for the year ahead rose to 4.3 per cent in July, after falling to 3.8 per cent in June. Business surveys generally indicate that inflationary pressures are modest. The NAB survey reported that businesses expect inflation in final product prices to be 0.5 per cent in the September quarter, and 0.4 per cent for retail prices. The latest Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey, which covers the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors, reported that expectations remain subdued, with few firms expecting to raise their prices in the September quarter. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of investors, measured by the difference between 10-year bond yields and indexed bonds, increased in the June quarter to around 2¾ per cent, from around 2½ per cent in the March quarter. Over the September quarter to date, bond market inflation expectations have eased slightly to around 2.6 per cent. Following the release of the CPI, financial-market economists surveyed by the Bank have updated their forecasts for inflation (Table 22). The median inflation forecast for the year to June 2003 is 2.4 per cent, roughly stable since the beginning of the year, and 2.5 per cent for the year to June 2004. The median inflation expectation of trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), has moderated to 3.0 per cent from <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span> reported last quarter. The median expectation for the year to June 2004 is 3.5 per cent. ", " The Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is currently around 2½ per cent, which is consistent with the forecasts presented in the May <em>Statement</em>. CPI inflation, at 2.8 per cent on a year-ended basis, remains slightly higher than underlying inflation, and next quarter may rise temporarily, reflecting the dropping out of the low September 2001 outcome from the year-ended calculation. ", " Underlying inflation, however, is likely to remain at or slightly below 2½ per cent over the second half of 2002. Wages and labour cost increases have remained contained to date and are generally not pressuring business margins, though there are some pressures from rising insurance premiums and utility prices. Increases in producer prices have also been modest, and business surveys continue to report subdued rises in input prices. In part this reflects the effect on traded goods prices of the appreciation of the exchange rate in the first half of the year, and the ongoing quiescence in world prices, particularly for electrical and computing equipment. ", " However, the labour market has improved since the beginning of the year, and survey data suggest that labour is becoming more difficult to find. A continuation of the robust growth in the Australian economy would see capacity utilisation rising over the period ahead, leading over time to a pick-up in wage outcomes and rising inflationary pressures. Hence, as stated in the May <em>Statement</em>, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation, after being around the middle of the target band in 2002, is likely to increase during 2003. This assessment is predicated on the usual technical assumptions that the exchange rate and oil prices remain around recent levels. It also assumes a continuation of the modest recovery in the global economy. ", " The recent developments in financial markets have increased the risk that global growth will be weaker than expected, with a consequent adverse effect on the Australian economy. While it is difficult to estimate the size of such effects at this stage, slower global and domestic growth, together with downward pressure on world prices, would reduce the scope for domestic price increases, although this may be offset to some extent by a lower exchange rate than would otherwise be the case. On the other hand, it is possible that global output will be stronger than expected if the volatility in financial markets proves to be short-lived, given that policy settings in most countries remain very expansionary. ", " First, this is the third year in a row that broad indices of share prices have fallen. Such long drawn-out falls are rare, having occurred only twice before over the past century. ", " Second, the cumulative falls are large. At one stage in mid July the S&amp;P 500 was down by 48 per cent from its peak, the largest such fall since the 1930s. ", " Third, the falls have continued despite the very substantial easing of monetary policy by the Fed and signs of economic recovery. ", " Over the past decade household debt levels in Australia have risen from relatively low levels by international standards to be comparable to those in other advanced countries. At the same time there has been strong growth in the value of assets owned by households, although at a somewhat slower pace, such that the ratio of household debt to assets has risen. ", " The bulk of the increase in household debt over the past decade has been related to housing. Currently, around 84 per cent of household debt is classified as lending for housing (Table A1),<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> comprising lending to owner-occupiers and investors. While owner-occupier mortgages remain the largest single component of household debt, loans for investor housing have grown significantly faster over the past decade than those for owner-occupied housing.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> ", " Consequently, the share of investor loans in the total stock of household debt has risen from 9 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent currently. ", " The growth in borrowing for owner-occupied housing has reflected an increased number of mortgages (as a result of the increase in the number of households in Australia) but primarily increased loan sizes. The average size of a new loan has risen from around $74,000 in 1991 to around $150,000 in 2001. Consequently, over the same period, the average size of all outstanding owner-occupier loans has risen from around $46,000 to $128,000. ", " The growth in borrowing for housing may be somewhat overstated – and lending for other purposes correspondingly understated – as some part of the increase in housing debt is likely to reflect an increasing share of borrowing classified as ‘housing’ being used for other purposes. When reporting lending data, financial institutions are required to classify lending by purpose, rather than by type of security, but this can be difficult to track through time. For example, a borrower redrawing a housing loan to purchase a car does not need to notify the lender of the purpose of the redraw, and hence the funds accessed will generally be classified as lending for housing. With the increased availability of financial products that allow borrowing secured by housing, and the rise in the underlying value of housing assets available to be used as collateral, it seems likely that an increased proportion of the lending classified as housing-related is actually used to finance consumption or to purchase other assets. ", " Despite the rapid rise in borrowing for housing, home ownership rates have been relatively stable over the past decade (Table A2). Around 70 per cent of the housing stock is owner-occupied, with around <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> being owned outright and 30 per cent owned with a mortgage. The remainder of the housing stock is rented, and hence is predominantly owned by investors. This pattern of home ownership is broadly the same across the capital cities. In non-metropolitan areas, the proportion of households owning their home outright is slightly higher, and the proportion owning their home with a mortgage slightly lower, than in the capital cities. Around 9 per cent of households own investment property as judged by those who reported rental income in the ABS 1998/99 Household Expenditure Survey. ", " Primarily reflecting the rise in house prices, the value of housing assets has risen at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8¾ per cent</span> since 1990 with the rate of increase accelerating in recent years (Table A3). The value of assets held in superannuation and direct equity has risen at a faster pace since 1990 but housing assets still comprise the bulk of household assets. ", " The value of household assets has grown at a slightly slower pace than household debt over the past decade or so, such that the ratio of household debt to assets has risen from around 14 per cent in 1990 to 16½ per cent in March 2002 (Graph A1). ", " The various measures of labour cost growth in Australia can at times present quite different signals about wage trends (Graph B1). These differences arise, in part, because the series are designed to measure different concepts. Of the most commonly used aggregate measures, average weekly earnings (AWE), average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) and the national accounts measure of average compensation are all ‘wage bill’ measures designed to measure the average level of wages or labour costs per employee, whereas the wage cost index (WCI) is designed to measure wage changes for a basket of constant quality jobs.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> The measures can also diverge because of their use of different information sources and the inclusion or exclusion of non-wage labour costs. ", " AWE and AWOTE are both sourced from the Average Weekly Earnings survey and exclude non-wage labour costs such as severance payments and superannuation contributions. Because these measures are based on estimates of the wage bill per employee, their movements will in principle reflect both changes in wage rates and compositional changes in the workforce. For example, the AWE estimate can be affected by changes in the share of full-time and part-time workers in the sample surveyed, as part-time workers tend to have lower weekly earnings. AWOTE will not be affected in this way, as it is based only on full-time jobs, which means it should provide a more accurate indication of changes in the hourly wage. Both series, however, can be affected by other sources of compositional change. For example, a rise in the share of workers in higher-wage jobs in the sample will tend to increase average earnings per worker, even if the wage paid remains unchanged, and thereby will boost the estimate of wages growth obtained from these series. ", " The national accounts measure of average compensation per employee is conceptually similar to the other wage-bill measures, but differs from them in two respects: it is derived from a different survey, and it incorporates a broad measure of non-wage labour costs, including severance pay and superannuation. The historical data presented in Graph B2 suggest that the inclusion of these non-wage labour costs usually makes only a relatively small difference to the estimate of the growth in labour costs. Nonetheless this series has at times diverged quite substantially from those derived from the AWE survey, with much of the difference apparently a result of differences in survey design. ", " Unlike the three average earnings measures discussed above, the WCI is designed to measure wage changes rather than levels. It measures wage rates<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"r4\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> for a set of constant quality jobs and is analogous in its construction to the Consumer Price Index. As such, it is less subject to the influence of compositional change and hence is less volatile than the other measures. A consequence of this construction is that the average growth rate of the WCI over time may differ from the growth in the wage-bill measures. In particular, given the tendency over time for lower-skilled jobs to be replaced by higher-skilled jobs which generally attract higher earnings, the WCI will record a lower growth rate than the other measures in the medium term. ", " In estimating the growth in unit labour costs (that is, labour costs adjusted for productivity) it is necessary to use wage and productivity estimates that are conceptually consistent. In particular, the effects of compositional change, which over time boosts both wages and productivity, need to be consistently treated. Available measures of productivity growth derived from the national accounts include these compositional effects and are therefore conceptually consistent with the wage-bill measures.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"r5\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 3\">[3]</a></sup> Because the WCI is designed to measure wage changes associated with specific jobs, it is difficult to construct a corresponding measure of productivity to enable a measure of unit labour costs to be calculated from this series. In particular, it would not be valid to estimate the growth in unit labour costs by adjusting the WCI using national-accounts based estimates of productivity. This would on average result in an underestimate of growth in unit labour costs, since compositional effects boosting wages and productivity would be excluded from the WCI but included in the productivity measure. ", " These considerations suggest that the appropriate choice of wage indicator depends upon the purpose for which it is being used. Wage-bill measures are conceptually consistent with available measures of productivity for the purposes of estimating growth in unit labour costs. However, these measures are relatively volatile as a result of short-term compositional changes in the workforce. The WCI is less volatile and may therefore be useful in assessing short-term wage trends, but it is not directly comparable with available productivity measures.

The first half of the year was a period of emerging optimism, with most observers expecting a gradual recovery in the global economy after last year's downturn, and the momentum of growth expected to build steadily in all the major economic regions. These perceptions were encouraged by clear signs of stronger growth in a number of countries, particularly in the United States but also in parts of east Asia and, to a lesser extent, in the euro area. In the second half of the year, however, considerable uncertainty has emerged as to whether the momentum of growth will be sustained. ", " The changing mood about the global economic outlook has been most clearly reflected in financial markets. The major changes have been the fall in share prices in all major countries since early in the second quarter of 2002, the fall in long-term government bond yields to 50-year lows, and the widening in spreads on corporate debt. ", " Broader economic data in a number of the major countries have also taken on a softer tone in recent months, suggesting that the modest global recovery underway since the start of this year has weakened. In the US, which has been the strongest of the major economies this year, the expansion to date has been driven mainly by consumer spending, and there is little sign yet of a pick-up in business investment, which would be an essential element of a more durable recovery. Elsewhere, the picture has been very mixed. Growth in the euro area has turned out to be disappointing, after some reasonably promising signs earlier in the year. In Japan, there are some signs of a pick-up in activity, but the economy remains fragile and heavily dependent on export markets. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Non-Japan</span> Asia has been the best performing of the major regions, with the Chinese and Korean economies growing strongly, though some of the smaller economies in the region appear to have weakened recently. Overall, the global recovery has remained tentative and has fallen short of the relatively optimistic expectations that were held around the middle of the year. ", " Whether or not the global economy gains greater momentum will depend importantly on the resolution of imbalances still weighing on growth in the major countries. Of particular importance will be the ongoing effects of the cumulative falls in equity prices. These will affect the major economies in a number of ways, including not just through their impact on wealth and confidence but also through their effects on corporate and financial-sector balance sheets. Some of these effects are already being seen, with businesses in the US for example now finding it more difficult or more expensive to raise capital, reflecting perceptions of increased risk. This has been associated with disappointing corporate profits in the US, a result, in part, of an overhang of capacity in some capital-intensive industries. In some respects, financial stresses in the European economies may be more severe than those in the US, given that the falls in equity markets in Europe have generally been larger. Share prices in financial firms in Europe, particularly insurance companies, have shown pronounced falls in recent months. Japan, of course, has its own longstanding imbalances that continue to hamper growth. ", " The overall effect of these forces on the global economy is highly uncertain. In an optimistic scenario, cyclical growth spurred by consumer demand and expansionary policy may be sufficient to wind back the various balance-sheet stresses, but a more pessimistic scenario involving disappointing profits, heightened pressure on balance sheets and weak investment spending in the major economies is also a real possibility. ", " It is not surprising that in this environment there has been a marked reassessment about the outlook for official interest rates in all major countries. In the US, expectations of monetary tightening largely evaporated in the third quarter, and were replaced by expectations of easing, which the Fed delivered in November. Similarly, in Europe, expectations of tightening have been replaced by expectations of easing, though official rates have continued steady to date. The group of mid-sized economies that were raising interest rates in the first half of the year, which includes Australia, have all kept rates steady since at least July; markets do not expect any near-term moves and in some cases expectations of easing are emerging even among these countries. ", " Australian financial markets have not been immune from developments overseas. Share prices in Australia have fallen over the past six months and domestic interest rates, both long term and short term, have adjusted down. Overall, however, domestic financial markets continue to show a good deal more stability than markets overseas, reflecting the steadier path of the domestic economy. ", " In contrast to the tentative nature of the global expansion, the Australian economy has so far continued to grow at a good pace. This performance has been driven by strong growth in domestic demand which, to date, has broadly counterbalanced the dampening effects of the weak external sector. The growth of domestic demand over the past year has been spread across all main components, with consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all contributing strongly. These developments have been associated with above-trend growth in employment, and a declining unemployment rate. Prospects in the period ahead will of course depend importantly on global developments, but will also depend on a range of rather disparate domestic factors, most notably conditions in the business sector, the dynamics of the housing market, and the impact of the drought. ", " Business investment has been an important contributor to growth over the past year. In contrast to the major economies abroad, Australia's business sector is in good shape, with a relatively high level of profits and generally sound balance sheets. In addition the direct effects of declining equity prices in Australia are likely to be more muted than those in other countries, given that Australia's share market has remained relatively resilient. In these circumstances, prospects for further growth in investment are still good, particularly given that the level of investment is coming off a quite low base. A number of large resource and infrastructure projects have commenced recently, and data on building approvals and commencements indicate that further strong growth in non-residential building work is in prospect. Of course, recent financial market developments and weaker global economic prospects might yet affect business spending plans, but the most recent business surveys, in the main, suggest a generally positive outlook. ", " The large rise in housing construction has also made an important contribution to the strength of the economy over the past year. As well, the rise in house prices over much of the recent period has added to household wealth and boosted the capacity of households to borrow and spend. Investors have played a large part in the buoyancy of the housing market, accounting for virtually all of the growth in new finance approvals in the sector over the past year, presumably in expectation of strong growth in prices. It has been apparent, however, that this process would not be sustainable indefinitely, with emerging oversupply being bound at some point to limit the scope for further price increases. ", " While most measures of housing prices rose strongly in the September quarter, there are some signs that price appreciation in particular sectors of the market is starting to abate. Prices of apartments have lagged behind house prices recently, and there are indications that apartment prices in parts of Melbourne and Sydney showed little, if any, increase in the September quarter. Recent anecdotal reports point to a more general waning of buyer interest, and there has been a noticeable decline in auction clearance rates in the past month or so. ", " With regard to housing construction activity, the latest indicators have remained quite strong, with building approvals, and approvals for housing finance, generally moving higher in the September quarter. Hence, in the short term, housing construction activity is set to continue expanding. But given the emerging oversupply in the sector, housing activity now appears likely to begin declining in the first half of 2003. ", " The rural sector is continuing to experience a severe drought, which will sharply cut rural production and incomes. It is now estimated that the decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage</span> point over the current financial year. Despite higher prices for some rural commodities, notably wheat and wool, net farm incomes this financial year are expected to be down by more than half from the high levels seen last year. ", " Drawing all these influences together, a modest slowing in domestic demand and output appears likely in the period ahead, principally reflecting the expected maturing of the housing cycle and the impact of the drought. While these factors have been evident for some time, they were initially expected to lead mainly to a rebalancing of growth, with the slowing in domestic demand being more or less offset by the impact of gradually improving external conditions. But with global economic prospects less assured, this expectation is unlikely to be met, and hence the economy overall can be expected to slow from its recent strong pace over the coming year. ", " Recent data on inflation have been consistent with the near-term outlook described in previous <em>Statements</em>. The CPI increased by 3.2 per cent over the past year, while measures of underlying inflation, designed to remove the effects of extreme price movements, are currently in a range between 2½ and 3¼ per cent in year-ended terms. The Bank's assessment based on the range of available measures is that underlying inflation is currently around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span>. ", " With evidence that wages and upstream price pressures are subdued, and no sign of global inflationary pressures, underlying inflation is likely to remain close to its recent level of around 2¾ per cent during 2003. This represents a slightly lower forecast than was presented in previous <em>Statements</em>, reflecting the noticeably weaker outlook for the global economy and, consequently, the less favourable environment for growth in Australia. CPI inflation could remain a bit higher than the underlying rate in the short term, reflecting the influence of the drought on food prices. But looking further ahead, the prospect is that CPI inflation will converge towards the underlying rate and hence will be within the target range. The risks around this forecast appear evenly balanced. If a reasonably favourable international growth outlook were to eventuate, the domestic economy could continue to expand at close to its recent pace, and in that scenario inflationary pressures may be expected to build gradually. On the other hand, an extended period of weaker growth in Australia and abroad might see inflation pressures easing further. ", " In its deliberations on monetary policy over recent months, the Board has taken into account the shifting prospects for the global economy as well as the range of important domestic influences on the economic outlook. These factors have been working in divergent directions, with the drought and the weak international environment subtracting from growth, while the stance of monetary policy and the dynamics of the housing market have been providing a stimulatory influence. The balance of these forces has shifted quite noticeably since mid-year. While initially it appeared that their net effect on the Australian economy in the medium term would most likely be in the direction of generating greater inflationary pressures, this became less clear as events unfolded during the second half of the year, as prospects for the global economy weakened. Some of this shift was already apparent at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> in August, though subsequent events have suggested a further weakening in global prospects since that time. In view of these developments the Board at its recent meetings has judged that the most prudent course was to retain the current policy setting for the present time, while continuing to assess how the international and domestic economies evolve. ", " Equity markets have remained at centre stage over recent months, with ongoing weakness in the major global indices accompanied by extreme volatility. The recovery from the post-September 11 lows started to peter out early in the June quarter, with broad measures of stock prices in the major economies having fallen sharply since. A rebound in late July and early August proved short-lived, with all of the major equity indices falling to new multi-year lows in early October (Graph 1). In the US and Europe the broad-based indices fell to levels last <span class=\"no-wrap\">seen in 1997</span>, while in Japan the Topix fell to its lowest level since 1984 (Graph 2). Although there was a modest recovery in equity prices in mid October, the US S&amp;P 500 index remains down by 20 per cent since the start of the year, and the Euro STOXX and the Japanese Topix are down 29 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. The S&amp;P 500 and the Euro STOXX are now down 40 per cent and 52 per cent respectively from their March 2000 peaks, while the Topix is down 50 per cent since February 2000 and 69 per cent since its peak at the <span class=\"no-wrap\">end of 1989 (Table 1)</span>. ", " The falls on major equity markets have been accompanied by extreme volatility, with the median daily percentage change in benchmark US indices over the past few months higher than at any time since the 1930s (Graph 3). Within the sharp downward trend over the past half year, there have been two significant rallies. The S&amp;P 500 increased by 21 per cent in a 4½ week period in July and August, and by 16 per cent in a 1½ week period in <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid October</span>. While these were significant movements, similar short-lived retracements have occurred in the past after large falls, without necessarily signalling the end to a bear market. ", " While the falls in broad measures of US equity prices over the past two years are significant, they remain well within the historical experience. The most comprehensive way of comparing the current equity weakness to previous bear markets is in terms of the real total return on equities over different periods. This measure includes both the price change and dividends received by shareholders, and then adjusts for changes in consumer prices. There have been 12 periods when this measure showed negative returns greater than 20 per cent in the US since 1870 (the period for which reliable data exist) (Table 2). The loss suffered by investors in real total returns in the current episode has been around 40 per cent, slightly larger than the average for earlier bear markets, and the biggest fall since 1974. Since the S&amp;P 500 peaked in March 2000, the current bear market has reversed around 5½ years of gains in real wealth, which is similar to the average for earlier declines. ", " The global equity market weakness since early 2000 has been driven primarily by the recognition that earnings of companies have been too low to justify the high valuations reached. Concerns about the strength of the global economic recovery, particularly the possibility that the recovery may be stalling, are adding to the nervousness about share valuations since, in that event, the expected increases in profits may not eventuate. In the US the outlook has led to significant downward revisions to market earnings expectations over the past few months, with Standard and Poor's ‘top-down’ forecasts for ‘as reported’ earnings growth in the US for 2002 cut from <span class=\"no-wrap\">44 per cent</span> to 24 per cent within a three-month period. ", " Continuing doubts about the accuracy of corporate accounts in the light of recent accounting scandals have added to the uncertainty. There remain divergences between different measures of corporate earnings, with many market participants now focusing on the National Accounts measure of earnings which shows corporate profits to have fallen marginally over the first half of 2002, with earnings now having been essentially flat since the beginning of 1997 (Graph 4). ", " Concerns about the traditional measures of earnings were highlighted by the release in October of Standard and Poor's new ‘core earnings’ measure, which attempts to focus on the ongoing operations of companies. Standard and Poor's estimate that there are two significant costs that are not fully accounted for under standard measures of earnings, including under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, namely stock options and the cost of funding pension liabilities when pension funds have failed to cover these liabilities on an ongoing basis. They estimate that if stock options had been accounted for when issued they would have reduced ‘as reported’ earnings for the aggregate of the S&amp;P 500 companies by around 20 per cent over the year to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">June quarter</span> 2002. The cost of topping up defined benefit pension schemes in the face of falling asset values would separately have reduced earnings by 25 per cent. ", " While the price/earnings ratio based on trailing earnings for the S&amp;P 500 has fallen to around 30, down from a peak of 47 earlier in the year, it remains well above the historical average of 15 and even the strong market expectations about earnings for the next 12 months imply a forward-looking ratio that is well above historical norms (Graph 5). ", " Equity markets in Europe, Japan and elsewhere have been subject to many of the same pressures affecting the US market. In fact, European markets have fallen by more than those in the US. One factor that has contributed to the weakness has been concerns about the health of financial institutions, especially insurance companies. While the Euro STOXX had fallen 60 per cent from its peak by early October, the fall in insurance stock prices reached 70 per cent. Although on average bank stock prices have fallen about the same as the Euro STOXX, some of the major European banks had fallen by more than 80 per cent to their most recent trough in early October. In Japan, domestic factors have also contributed to weakness, with the possible impact of a more aggressive policy stance in dealing with problems in the financial sector contributing to falls in banking sector stocks. The broader market was also affected by this news on expectations that large numbers of companies could be affected by tightened credit standards in the banking sector. ", " Asian emerging equity markets have generally followed the same pattern as markets in the major industrial economies over recent months, albeit with a smaller fall and more muted recovery (Graph 6). The Indonesian market was hit hard by the news of the Bali bombings, with share prices falling 10 per cent in the first day of trading following the attacks. Latin American markets have also generally moved with the major markets. ", " In the US, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept the policy rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent from December 2001 to November 2002, when it cut rates by a further 50 basis points (Graph 7, Table 3). As an indication of how views about the economy and markets have changed in recent months, market participants throughout the first half of 2002 were expecting the Fed to be increasing rates by the end of the year (Graph 8). These expectations started to recede in the third quarter, and were eventually replaced by expectations of easing; these were fulfilled in November. ", " Policy interest rates in the euro area have remained unchanged for the past year. However, as in the US, financial market expectations for future policy changes have moved significantly over recent months. Whereas earlier expectations were that the next move would be an increase, the current expectation is that the ECB will cut its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 3.00 per cent, by December. In the UK the futures market is also signalling a cut of 25 basis points (to 3.75 per cent) in the policy rate by the end of the year, an expectation which was heightened by the release of the minutes of the October Monetary Policy Committee meeting which showed that three of the nine committee members voted for a 25 basis point cut. ", " The Bank of Japan (BoJ) increased its reserves target from <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>10–15 trillion to <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>15–20 trillion in late October and increased its monthly purchases of Japanese Government bonds by <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>0.2 trillion per month to <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>1.2 trillion. It also made initial moves to address weakness in the financial sector by announcing a plan to purchase stocks from banks to reduce their exposure to equity market volatility. ", " The tightening cycles in several of the smaller industrial economies that began over the first half of 2002 have paused over the past three months as the outlook for the global recovery has been downgraded. In addition to Australia's moves earlier this year (see chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’), there were also increases in policy rates in Canada (a cumulative 75 basis points to 2.75 per cent), New Zealand (100 basis points to 5.75 per cent), Norway (50 basis points to 7 per cent) and Sweden (50 basis points to 4.25 per cent). Unlike in the larger economies, where expectations have been for monetary easing, market expectations in most of these mid-sized economies are for generally steady official rates in the months ahead, reflecting their relative economic strength. In New Zealand, the new Reserve Bank Governor and the Finance Minister signed a new policy targets agreement, which raises the lower range of the inflation target band to 1 per cent from zero and extends the time horizon for the target to the medium term. ", " Official interest rates in most emerging economies have remained relatively steady over recent months. One exception was Brazil, where the central bank raised interest rates in October by 3 percentage points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">21 per cent</span>, in a move aimed at stemming the slide of the real on the foreign exchange market. ", " Bond markets in the major economies have largely taken their lead from equity markets over recent months. Government bond yields fell to very low levels, and spreads on corporate debt continued to widen, as investors sought the relative security of government debt. While these movements have reversed somewhat since mid October as the equity market has recovered, corporate debt spreads remain unusually elevated, reflecting ongoing concerns about financial fragility in the corporate sector. ", " Yields on 10-year US government debt fell by around 90 basis points over August and September, to a 44-year low of 3.6 per cent. They rebounded sharply in mid October as equity markets recovered, but this proved temporary, and yields have since fallen back to 4.1 per cent (Graph 9). Using yields in the market for <span class=\"no-wrap\">inflation-indexed</span> securities, it is possible to decompose these movements in nominal yields into the change in inflationary expectations and the change in real yields on bonds. The data suggest that most of the fall in nominal yields in August and September was attributable to lower real yields, although reduced inflation expectations also played a role. This fall in real bond yields is consistent with both a flight to quality and security in the wake of large falls in equity prices over this period, and a lowering of real growth expectations for the US economy. US investors have been shifting money out of equity mutual funds into bond funds in recent months (Graph 10). ", " Yields on European government bonds have moved in a similar fashion to US yields, although movements have been more subdued. Yields on German government bonds fell by around 40 basis points during August and September as equity markets weakened, the outlook for the European economic growth deteriorated, and market expectations of lower short-term rates increased (Graph 11). Yields reached a low of 4.3 per cent in late September, before rebounding in October on the turnaround in global equity markets. ", " Yields on Japanese Government bonds have also fallen since August, declining by 35 basis points to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>. Yields initially approached this level in mid September, but rebounded to 1.3 per cent after the Bank of Japan announced its initiative to buy equities from banks, a measure which was perceived as likely to reduce future BoJ bond purchases. Yields have since moved back to their lows as market participants have scaled back their perceptions about the likely size of BoJ stock purchases. The move lower was also assisted by the BoJ announcement that it will increase its monthly purchases of Government bonds, and indications from the Government that changes in the stance on resolving banking sector problems will not be accompanied by any major increase in debt issuance. ", " In the US, corporate spreads to Treasuries have generally remained high over recent months, reflecting continued risk aversion and concerns over US corporate health (Graph 12). These concerns have been most notable for medium-grade credits; the spread between BBB-rated corporate bonds and 10-year Treasuries at one point in October reached 3.6 per cent, the highest level since the early 1980s. There seems to be a fear that companies in this grouping in particular are at risk of downgrades to ‘junk’ status. A prominent example is the very large rise in the spread for Ford Motor Co. debt, from 200 basis points mid year to around 600 basis points now. ", " Emerging market sovereign spreads have narrowed over the past few months (Graph 13). Spreads on Brazilian debt rose to more than 2,000 basis points ahead of the October elections, but have since moderated, although at 1,700 basis points they remain at unsustainable levels (Graph 14). Spreads remain at default levels in Argentina, but have fallen slightly in other Latin American countries. Yields spreads on Asian sovereign bonds have also narrowed modestly since the time of the last <em>Statement</em>. ", " In contrast to the extreme volatility seen in equity and bond markets, currency markets have been relatively stable over the past three months (Graphs 15 and 16). In trade-weighted terms the US dollar has fallen by around 1 per cent, with a 2 per cent appreciation against the yen, offset by an equivalent depreciation against the euro. ", " Asian and Latin American currencies that float were generally weaker against the US dollar over the quarter. The Brazilian real weakened significantly through September on electoral uncertainty, and despite a recovery since then remains down 35 per cent for the year to date. ", " Initially, as sentiment about the global economy began to deteriorate around mid year, the Australian dollar fell quite sharply, from around US57 cents to around US54 cents (Graph 17). This reversed about half the rise that had taken place during the phase of bullish sentiment about the global economy in the first half of the year. Since then, however, even though sentiment about the global economy has deteriorated further, the Australian dollar has not followed. In fact, it has appreciated by around 3 per cent against the US dollar over the past three months. The initial sharp reaction to the change in global sentiment may have reflected a view that the global slowing would flow through quickly to the local economy. The fact that many market participants had built up quite long positions in the Australian dollar during the first half of the year, in anticipation of global economic recovery, may have accentuated the move as these positions were adjusted. ", " The relative resilience of the Australian economy to date has no doubt helped support the currency recently. One mechanism through which this is happening is the widening interest spread in the Australian dollar's favour, as interest rates around the world have fallen to exceptionally low levels. This is leading to strong demand for Australian dollar securities in overseas markets. One area where this has been particularly noticeable is among Japanese retail investors. For the year to date, issuance of A$ Uridashi bonds amounted to $10.4 billion, with most of the issuance occurring over the past four months. The recent period has been the strongest for Uridashi issuance on record. ", " Also lending support to the currency was the upgrade in October by Moody's of Australia's foreign currency credit rating and country credit ceiling from Aa2 to Aaa (Table 4). Moody's had reduced Australia's rating from Aaa to Aa1 in 1986, with a further reduction to Aa2 in 1989. Standard and Poor's and Fitch also lowered Australia's rating over this period, though subsequently Standard and Poor's raised its rating from AA to AA+ (equivalent to a change from Aa2 to Aa1). ", " On a trade-weighted basis the Australian dollar has appreciated by around 3 per cent over the past three months, with strongest gains against the Japanese yen and some other Asia-Pacific currencies (Table 5). The current level of the trade-weighted index is around 6 per cent below its 1990s average. ", " The RBA has continued to purchase foreign reserves in the market over recent months. In net terms its outright transactions (and interest earnings) have lifted holdings of net reserves. At the end of October, net reserves were $11.1 billion, up from $7.0 billion at the start of 2002. Total reserve holdings have not changed much as there has been some reduction in foreign exchange held under swaps, from $29.5 billion in December 2001 to $26.2 billion. ", " The global economy continues to recover at a modest pace, although sentiment in international financial markets remains fragile and the downside risks to the recovery appear to have increased recently. This is clearly affecting business and household confidence, and is evident in some recent economic indicators. Domestic demand continues to drive growth in the US, while exports have formed the basis of the very weak recoveries in both Europe and Japan. Exports have also played an important role in the pick-up in non-Japan Asia, though in contrast to earlier recoveries, domestic demand (and intra-regional trade) is making a sizable contribution to growth. ", " Forecasts for world growth have been revised down in recent months. In its latest assessment of the international outlook, released in September, the IMF lowered its forecast for growth in the G7 countries in 2003 by <span class=\"no-wrap\">½ percentage point</span>, to 2¼ per cent on a year-average basis (Table 6). The latest private-sector Consensus forecasts present a similar view in aggregate for 2003. ", " The recovery has continued in the US, though the growth has been uneven. After a weak outcome in the June quarter, GDP increased by 0.8 per cent in the September quarter to be 3.0 per cent higher over the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 7)</span>. However, the pace of growth slowed through the quarter. Nearly all of the growth in the September quarter was accounted for by consumption, which was boosted by a surge in purchases of motor vehicles. ", " Household spending remains firm, supported by low interest rates and continued growth in household disposable income. The fall in long-term interest rates, in particular, has encouraged borrowers to refinance existing home loans at a lower cost. House prices have also risen, allowing home owners to use the increased equity to finance consumption. Marketing incentives, such as zero-interest financing for motor vehicles, have also boosted spending. Notwithstanding these positive factors, the fall in equity prices has reduced household wealth over the past couple of years, particularly for higher income households. Consumer sentiment has also fallen to well below average levels. ", " After shedding jobs through much of 2001 and into the early part of this year, the US labour market recovered for a time, but employment flattened out again in September and October. Manufacturing employment has continued to fall, while employment in the public and services sectors has grown moderately. ", " In contrast to the resilience of household spending, conditions in the business sector remain subdued. Industrial production has fallen in recent months, reversing some of the rise that had occurred over the previous six months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 18)</span>. The most recent fall was largely associated with a decline in the production of motor vehicles, which had been boosted around the middle of the year when large sales incentives were re-introduced. There has also been a deterioration in manufacturing sentiment, with the ISM measure returning to levels associated with stable output, after rising strongly around the turn of the year. Orders for non-defence capital goods declined marginally in the September quarter. Notwithstanding these developments, with the current level of inventories relative to sales remaining at a low level, any growth in demand should be quickly reflected in production in the period ahead. ", " Corporate profits, as measured in the national accounts, have begun to increase after falling quite markedly over the past five years. However, the ability of the larger corporations to raise funds is being adversely affected by market perceptions of corporate balance sheet fragility, owing in part to the shortfall in defined benefit superannuation schemes. The ratio of business investment to GDP has now reached quite low levels, which implies some unwinding of the investment overhang built up in earlier years, but significant excess capacity remains in a number of capital intensive sectors. ", " US fiscal policy over the past year has been strongly supportive of growth, with the turnaround in the budget balance the largest since 1975. The more expansionary state of fiscal policy this year owes mainly to the effect of automatic stabilisers, as well as tax cuts and increased government expenditure, particularly for defence. Monetary policy also remains accommodative, with the Fed easing by a further 50 basis points in November. ", " Consumer price inflation has fluctuated with movements in energy prices, but has remained below 2 per cent in year-ended terms (Graph 19). The core measure of inflation has edged lower and was 2¼ per cent in September. The large gap between services and goods inflation remains. Services inflation slowed to a little over 3½ per cent in the year to September, while core goods prices fell by around 1 per cent. Growth in labour compensation has eased with the employment cost index rising at a year-ended rate of 3.7 per cent in the September quarter; growth in the wages component has slowed a little from earlier in the year, while benefits have continued to grow strongly. ", " Having recorded declines in output in the four previous quarters, the Japanese economy returned to growth in the June quarter, with GDP rising by 0.6 per cent (Table 8). Sizable revisions to the national accounts data eliminated the strong growth that was originally reported for the March quarter, while also indicating that the contraction in 2001 was deeper than previously thought (Graph 20). Exports have been a significant driver of growth, and while there have been modest increases in private consumption, both business and residential investment have continued to fall. ", " There are some positive signs, with industrial production increasing in recent months, although the pace of growth has been somewhat slower than earlier in the year. This pattern is evident in the Tankan survey, with business sentiment and investment intentions having recovered from their lows towards the end of 2001, but with the rate of improvement slowing more recently. Exports have declined over the past couple of months, though they remain at high levels. Machinery orders, after falling through much of 2001, appear to have stabilised, albeit at a low level. Outside of the manufacturing sector, the tertiary activity index has been broadly flat over the past year. ", " Conditions for the household sector remain poor. While employment has risen in recent months, with employment in September ½ per cent higher than the trough in May, the unemployment rate has remained around its historical high of 5½ per cent (Graph 21). The decline in compensation has accelerated, owing mainly to a reduction around the middle of the year in bonus payments, which are typically linked to corporate profitability. Deflation continues, with consumer prices declining by 0.7 per cent over the year to September. Over the past five years the price level, as measured by the consumer price index, has fallen by nearly 3 per cent. ", " Non-Japan Asia has been an area of relative economic strength so far in 2002. The Chinese economy is continuing to grow at around 8 per cent per annum, according to official data. Excluding China, output in the region increased for a fourth consecutive quarter in June, to be 4½ per cent higher over the year. While some of this growth has been sourced from the external sector, a sizable proportion is due to rising domestic demand <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 22)</span>. Consumption was a major contributor to growth in most countries over the year to June, with business investment also rising strongly in the first half of this year. Growth in Korea has been particularly robust, owing mainly to rapid growth in consumption, which has been supported by a strong pick-up in household borrowing and low unemployment. In contrast, Hong Kong remains weak with domestic demand falling significantly over the year to June. Growth in Singapore also faltered in the September quarter. ", " Manufacturing production in non-Japan Asia has expanded rapidly over the past year (Graph 23). While China accounted for much of the strength, output in the rest of non-Japan Asia has exceeded its previous peak in the middle of 2000. Reflecting increased domestic demand, manufacturing production has generally grown faster than exports over the past couple of years. Services sector output has also increased, while, in contrast, the construction industry has continued to weaken. ", " Labour markets in most countries in the region continue to improve, with unemployment rates generally declining. China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan are experiencing mild deflation on a year-ended basis. ", " In New Zealand output rose by 1.7 per cent in the June quarter to be 4.0 per cent higher over the year. Growth in both domestic demand and exports has been robust over the past year. Inflation, at 2.6 per cent over the year to the September quarter, has been steady for most of this year. A change to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand policy objective was announced in September, with the focus moving to a more medium-term approach to achieving price stability. The bottom of the inflation target was also raised from 0 to 1 per cent, with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> upper limit retained. ", " Europe has yet to show signs of a significant recovery. GDP in the euro area increased only modestly in the first half of the year, to be 0.7 per cent higher than a year earlier (Table 9). For the first time in nearly a year household consumption contributed to growth in the quarter, though investment fell for the sixth consecutive quarter and is nearly 3 per cent lower over the year. Exports remain the main source of growth. Across the major economies, growth remains weaker in Germany and Italy, while more robust consumption growth has driven stronger outcomes in France and Spain. ", " More recent data have been disappointing. Growth in industrial production appears to have stalled, following a moderate pick-up in the early part of the year. With financial stresses of the type hampering the US recovery at least as severe in Europe, measures of business sentiment have retraced some of their earlier gains. Current business conditions, as measured in the German IFO survey, have remained weak, while some of the optimism evident in the expectations component of the survey earlier in the year, has been wound back (Graph 24). A similar pattern is evident in the other major euro area economies. The export sector remains an exception, with exports rising over much of this year. ", " The labour market has remained relatively resilient despite the slow pace of growth, with the unemployment rate for the euro area in the September quarter only 0.3 percentage points above the cyclical trough last year. However, the aggregate numbers mask differing developments amongst the major economies. In Germany, unemployment has risen by 0.7 percentage points from its low in 2001, while unemployment in Italy has continued to fall. Consumer sentiment has also unwound most of the gains from earlier in the year to be marginally above its trough late last year. ", " Year-ended consumer price inflation has picked up slightly in the past few months to be a little over 2 per cent, after falling in the early part of the year (Graph 25). This mostly reflects the impact of higher oil prices, as core inflation (which excludes food and energy) has remained steady at just under 2½ per cent. In Germany, year-ended inflation is currently around 1 per cent, the lowest rate in the euro area, while it is around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1¾ per cent</span> in France and 2¾ per cent in Italy. Annual wages growth in the euro area has remained a little under 4 per cent, after accelerating over the past few years. ", " The European Commission has indicated that some requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact are likely to be modified, as weak economic conditions have made the 2004 deadline for countries to balance their budgets unrealistic. A relaxation of the deadline would give the French and Italian governments some scope to proceed with promised tax cuts. ", " In the United Kingdom GDP grew by 0.7 per cent in the September quarter, to be 1.7 per cent higher over the year. Growth in the services sector in the quarter continued at a robust pace and the manufacturing sector expanded for the first time since 2000. Growth in household consumption remained firm, supported by rapid growth in house prices, which are over 20 per cent higher than a year ago. Rises in house prices have also boosted dwelling investment in recent quarters. The labour market has been resilient, with unemployment just above historical lows in the September quarter, as jobs have continued to be created in the services sector. Year-ended inflation (excluding mortgage payments) was around 2 per cent in recent months, as falling goods prices have offset increasing services prices. ", " According to the latest national accounts, real output rose by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3¾ per cent</span> higher than a year earlier (Graph 26). While this represents a somewhat slower pace of growth than was recorded in recent quarters, the aggregate figure masks sharply contrasting trends in domestic demand and exports. Domestic final demand has expanded by 6.9 per cent over the past year, close to its strongest annual pace of growth over the past decade. The recent strength in domestic demand has reflected the combination of continued rapid growth in consumer spending, the upswing in housing activity and a pick-up in business investment. In line with the strength in domestic demand, import volumes grew by 12 per cent over the year while exports declined by more than 1 per cent, owing to the weak global economy. Consequently, net exports subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP growth over the year to June (Table 10). ", " The outlook for the Australian economy remains quite favourable, although growth will be reduced by the impact of the drought on the farm sector. In addition there is likely to be some rebalancing of growth, with domestic demand slowing while net exports continue to reduce growth, but by a lesser amount than they did over the past year. ", " Household consumption spending continued to grow robustly in the June quarter, rising by 1½ per cent to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">4½ per cent</span> higher than a year earlier. Spending on household goods was especially strong, in line with buoyant house-building activity. Recent indicators suggest that consumption has continued to rise at a good pace, with the volume of retail sales up by 0.7 per cent in the September quarter (Graph 27). Motor vehicle sales to households fell slightly in the September quarter but remain at a high level. ", " Consumer spending has been supported by rising household incomes and house prices. Consumer sentiment has eased back in recent months, but is still slightly above its long-run average. The value of household assets rose by 12¼ per cent over the year to June and has averaged more than 10 per cent per annum over the past five <span class=\"no-wrap\">years (Table 11)</span>. In recent quarters the large increases in house prices have more than offset the effect on aggregate household wealth of the falls in the value of equity holdings, which account for a smaller share of the total. This pattern continued in the September quarter, with indicators suggesting a further strong rise in house prices, while equity prices fell by 7½ per cent. ", " Rises in the value of household assets and low financing costs have encouraged households to finance consumption through borrowing. Over the year to September, household borrowing rose by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">17¾ per cent</span>. While the bulk of this borrowing is to finance dwelling acquisition, some part of that recorded as borrowing for housing is likely to have been used to fund consumption. Products and financial services such as home-equity loans and redraw facilities have improved the ability of households to borrow against their equity in property. Overall, growth in household debt outpaced that of household assets over the year to the June quarter, and as a result the ratio of debt to assets increased to 15 per cent from 14½ per cent in the previous year. However, debt service payments have remained relatively stable at around 6 per cent of household disposable income in recent quarters (Graph 28). ", " Activity in the housing sector has expanded strongly over the past year with dwelling investment rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4¾ per cent</span> in the June quarter, to be 30 per cent higher over the year. Leading indicators for housing suggest that this high level of activity is likely to be sustained until the March quarter of 2003. ", " However, the indicators suggest somewhat divergent trends in the period ahead for the detached housing market, which is predominantly owner-occupied, compared with the multi-unit sector, which tends to have a greater share of investors. Activity in the detached housing sector appears to be close to its peak. Building approvals for the construction of new houses have stabilised at a high level over the past year, notwithstanding a temporary surge in August (Graph 29). The number of new loan approvals for the construction of housing for owner-occupation has declined over the course of 2002. In part this reflects the cessation at the end of June of the Commonwealth Additional Grant to first-home buyers building a home – the share of first-home buyers obtaining a loan approval has fallen noticeably over the past year. But it is also consistent with the pattern observed in previous housing cycles that the owner-occupied market tends to peak prior to the investor segment of the market. ", " In contrast, leading indicators of activity in the multi-unit sector have picked up again recently. Approvals for the construction of multi-unit housing in the September quarter were nearly 18 per cent higher than a year earlier. The recent increase in approvals was spread across most of the capital cities. Loan approvals to investors for new construction have also risen sharply in recent months, increasing by 15 per cent over the three months to August. ", " Lending for housing is still being pushed along by historically high activity in the investor market. Over the past year, loan approvals to investors have risen by 42 per cent compared with 1 per cent for owner-occupiers over the same period (Graph 30). Thus virtually all the increase in approvals over the past year is attributable to investors. ", " A number of factors seem to be contributing to the surge in lending to investors. Low interest rates and eager mortgage lenders have made finance readily available. The relatively poor performance of equity markets over the past couple of years has also increased the attractiveness of investing in property and made it easier for those organisations aggressively marketing property as a tax-effective investment. Finally, the large increases in property prices in the past have led investors to assume that these will continue in the future, notwithstanding the increasing signs of oversupply in the investor property market. ", " These developments share a number of similarities with those in the late 1980s (Graph 31). In both episodes, there was an increase in the appeal of housing as an investment option in the wake of a downturn in equity markets. Consequently, there was a marked increase in lending to investors in both periods, although investor participation has been greater in the current episode. ", " Most indicators of house prices show strong rises in the September quarter following on from the large rises over recent years (Table 12). In Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – the cities for which there are the most complete data – there is a clear tendency for house prices to have risen further than unit prices. There is also evidence that, in some cases, unit prices have been flat or have fallen. The real estate consultants Residex collect a series for prices based on repeat sales; that is, they follow the prices of individual properties that have changed hands at least twice in recent years. This suggests that although house prices rose in the September quarter, the prices of units were flat in Sydney and fell in Melbourne. Thus the part of the property market to which most of the investor borrowing is being directed is the part where prices are rising least, if at all. ", " In line with strong growth in domestic demand, businesses have generally experienced favourable conditions through the past year, though conditions have varied significantly between sectors. Growth in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">goods-producing</span> sector has been robust, with strength in the construction, manufacturing and retail sectors, while the service sectors have continued to slow (Graph 32). This is particularly so for the property and business services sector, which has been affected by reduced spending by firms on, inter alia, consulting, marketing and technical services. ", " Most measures of business conditions remain at levels consistent with trend growth in the non-farm sector <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 33)</span>. The broadly based NAB survey suggests that business conditions continued to improve in the September quarter, particularly in sectors such as construction, retail and wholesale trade. In the manufacturing sector, the ACCI-Westpac and AIG surveys report conditions being slightly above average despite easing recently. Consistent with the recovery in business investment, capital spending intentions remain high. While measures of business confidence have fallen in recent months, they generally remain at or above long-run average levels. ", " The farm sector remains a notable exception and conditions have deteriorated further in recent months as the drought has persisted. The June quarter Rabobank Rural Confidence Survey recorded a large increase in the number of respondents expecting investment in the agricultural economy and farm incomes to weaken over the next 12 months (Graph 34). Confidence has fallen across all parts of the country, with the sharpest falls in New South Wales owing to the severity of drought in that state. The dry conditions curtailing farm output will limit rural exports (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#balance-of-payments\">Balance of Payments</a>’) and farm incomes and those of businesses connected to the rural economy, with adverse consequences for overall economic growth (see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A: Economic Effects of the Drought</a>’ for further details). ", " Reflecting the strong conditions in the non-farm sector, corporate profits as measured by gross operating surplus (GOS) were around 12 per cent higher over the year to June, despite falling slightly in the June quarter. Profits of domestically oriented industries continued to rise in the June quarter, benefiting from the strength in domestic demand. However, this was more than offset by a decline in mining profits, reflecting lower export volumes, lower US dollar prices for some resources and the higher Australian dollar prevailing in the first half of the year. Nonetheless, the level of mining profits remains high by historical standards. Small-business profits also declined slightly in the June quarter, with a decline in rural incomes more than offsetting continued strength in the retail and residential construction sectors, but have grown by about 12 per cent over the year. Business surveys show that firms generally remain confident about the profit outlook. ", " In addition to the internal funding provided by the rise in profits over the past year, businesses have also increased their capital raisings from external sources. Business borrowing from intermediaries grew at an annualised rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> over the six months to September, after being broadly flat over the preceding six-month period. Direct capital raisings through both non-intermediated debt and equity issuance increased more modestly over this period, possibly reflecting the decline in equity markets and a widening in corporate bond spreads. ", " The overall financial position of the business sector remains in good shape. Debt levels relative to gross operating surplus have been broadly constant in recent years, following significant reductions in leverage in the early 1990s, and they remain low by historical standards. Interest payments expressed as a share of profits remain at low levels. ", " The combination of ready access to funding at a relatively low cost and strong domestic economic growth has been conducive to a solid recovery in investment spending. Business investment rose by nearly 15 per cent over the year to the June quarter, led by strong increases in spending on both machinery and equipment and buildings and structures; growth in computer software investment picked up only modestly through this period. ", " Despite this growth over the past year, investment as a share of GDP still remains at a relatively low level <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 35)</span>. Indicators of investment intentions point to further strong growth in business investment in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2002/03</span>. The June quarter ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey suggests that investment in machinery and equipment is expected to grow by around 13 per cent in nominal terms this financial year, assuming a five-year average realisation ratio; private-sector surveys also report robust investment intentions. The pick-up in equipment investment spending is expected to be particularly strong in the mining, manufacturing, and transport and storage industries. However, weaker spending on agricultural equipment, owing to drought conditions and an expected fall in agricultural income, is likely to provide a restraining influence on overall investment in machinery and equipment in the current financial year. ", " Investment in buildings and structures has also risen strongly over the first half of 2002. Favourable forward-looking indicators and a large build-up of work in the early stages of construction imply that growth in buildings and structures investment should continue over the coming quarters. Furthermore, state governments have recently announced a suite of major projects, some with private-sector involvement and largely concentrated in the transport and utilities industries, which will result in a significant increase in investment. The Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em> confirms the favourable outlook for buildings and structures investment, with work about to begin or recently having commenced on a large number of resource-related projects, many public infrastructure projects, and on office construction. Looking further ahead, a number of large-scale engineering projects are in prospect as a result of Australia LNG securing a contract to supply LNG to China for 25 years, beginning in about the middle of the decade. ", " After a period of slower growth around the middle of the year, employment increased by 0.6 per cent in the three months to October, and is now 2.0 per cent higher than the same period last year (Graph 36). Full-time employment rose by 0.6 per cent in the three months to October to be 1.1 per cent higher than a year ago, while part-time employment has remained strong, rising by 0.7 per cent in the three months to October, to stand 4.5 per cent higher over the year. These gains in employment have been reflected in the unemployment rate, which has fallen by 1 percentage point since the beginning of the year. ", " Improved labour market conditions have been evident in most states. Queensland recorded the fastest employment growth in the year to the three months to October, rising by 3.1 per cent, and, consistent with this, recorded the largest unemployment rate fall across all states (Table 13). Employment growth in South Australia and Western Australia has also been strong, at 2.6 and 2.4 per cent in the year to the three months to October. While employment growth has been slower in Victoria and NSW, these states have recorded the lowest unemployment rates. Tasmania continues to record a higher unemployment rate than the rest of the country. ", " The decomposition of employment growth by industry reveals trends generally in line with the pattern of <span class=\"no-wrap\">output (Table 14)</span>. Employment in the retail and wholesale trade sectors, which increased by 0.8 per cent in the September quarter, continues to be supported by strength in consumer spending. There has also been a recovery in manufacturing employment, with a 2 per cent rise in the quarter, following two previous consecutive quarters of growth. However, employment remains weak in industries that have been most exposed to the downturn in tourism, such as accommodation, cafes and restaurants and transport and storage, which includes airline travel. Furthermore, employment in the rural sector fell sharply in the quarter, to be well down on levels of a year ago, with much of the fall concentrated in NSW and Western Australia, reflecting the initial effects of drought conditions. ", " Labour productivity growth measured on an output per person employed basis has slowed somewhat from the rapid pace recorded in the second half of last year. In the June quarter this measure of productivity increased by 0.4 per cent, to be 2.2 per cent higher over the year. Productivity measured on an hours-worked basis also increased by 0.4 per cent in the quarter, and by 3.2 per cent in year-ended terms. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand have generally improved over the past few months, and remain supportive of a continued expansion in employment in the near term (Graph 37). The ABS employer-based measure of vacancies picked up in the September quarter to reach levels considerably higher than a year earlier. After patches of weakness in the middle of 2002, measures of print-based vacancies have also reported more positive outcomes, restoring the upward trend evident in these series since the beginning of the year. The ANZ newspaper-based series posted a 4.4 per cent increase in October, to be 17.8 per cent higher than the same time last year. In contrast, skilled vacancies data compiled by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) fell slightly in October, but are almost 20 per cent higher than a year ago. Employment intentions for the December quarter reported in the NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys are well above long-run levels, while intentions reported in other surveys, such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, remain around long-run levels. ", " With the Australian economy continuing to grow faster than a number of its major trading partners, the trade deficit has widened over the past year, to be around 1½ per cent of GDP in the September quarter. Assuming that the net income deficit as a proportion of GDP remained constant, this would suggest a current account deficit of around 4¼ per cent of GDP in the September quarter (Graph 38). Unlike the experience in previous international downturns, Australia's terms of trade have remained relatively stable during the recent period at around their highest level for over 10 years. This largely reflects the high prices received for a number of commodity exports, as well as declining import prices, particularly for electronic equipment. The strength of Australia's terms of trade has helped to limit the cyclical widening in the current account deficit. ", " Reflecting the weak world economy, the value of exports has fallen by about 3¾ per cent over the year to the September quarter. Much of this decline was concentrated towards the end of last year, when merchandise exports to most markets fell. Since then, growth in merchandise exports has varied across markets (Table 15). Strength in domestic demand has supported rapid growth in exports to Korea and China, while exports to <span class=\"no-wrap\">New Zealand</span> have picked up strongly. A recovery is also evident in merchandise exports to Japan. In contrast, exports to the US remain weak, owing to sizable falls in exports of motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and meat. There have been large declines in exports to India and the Middle East, though this followed very strong rises in previous years. ", " After declining sharply in the second half of 2001, the value of resource exports has subsequently recovered, increasing by about 7½ per cent over the past three quarters (Graph 39). A large rise in the value of exports of oil and LNG accounted for around half of the increase, mainly reflecting increases in oil prices. In contrast, receipts from coal exports have fallen as subdued growth in world industrial production and an unusually mild northern hemisphere winter have pushed thermal coal prices lower. The value of base metals exports also fell over the three quarters to September, owing partly to softer prices for a number of base metals. In the period ahead, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) expects nickel and zinc production to be boosted by the introduction of new capacity. ", " In August, the Australia LNG consortium won the right to supply LNG to China. The contract to supply over <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 million</span> tonnes of LNG annually to China's Guangdong province over 25 years, beginning in 2005/06, is reported to be worth between $20 billion and $25 billion. According to ABARE, LNG exports, which account for about <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> of the value of resource exports, are expected to double over the next five years. In order to meet supply commitments, the consortium is expected to invest in a fifth LNG processing train. ", " The value of rural exports fell by about 2½ per cent in the September quarter to be around 13 per cent lower over the year. The value of meat exports fell by about 8 per cent in the September quarter, and was more than 17 per cent lower than a year earlier, partly reflecting reduced demand from Japan. The capacity for Australian beef exports to be diverted to other markets is limited, given the existence of quotas in the US, the other major destination for Australian meat exports. Beef prices have declined, exacerbated by drought conditions in the US and Australia, which have led to increased livestock slaughterings. The value of wool exports has risen over the past few quarters, with higher prices offsetting the reduction in flock size. The value of cereal exports fell by around 1 per cent in the September quarter. ", " The drought is expected to lead to a significant decline in rural exports in coming quarters (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a> for a discussion of the economic effects of the drought). ABARE recently revised down its forecast for wheat production in 2002/03 to just over 10 million tonnes, compared with 24 million tonnes in the previous financial year (Graph 40). ", " Weak growth in our trading partners continues to adversely affect manufactured export earnings, with the value of manufactured exports only 2½ per cent higher than a year ago, well down on the average annual rate of growth of 9½ per cent over the past decade. Exports of machinery have declined over the past year, falling by around 4½ per cent over the year to the September quarter. However, receipts from the export of transport equipment continue to rise and have more than doubled over the past six years. ", " Service exports also continue to bear the effects of slow growth in the world economy and international trade. They rose by about 1½ per cent in the September quarter but remain about 3 per cent lower over the year. Weakness in service export earnings over the past year has been fairly broadly based, with the value of transportation and travel services exports both falling. ", " Strong growth in domestic demand, coupled with falls in import prices, has resulted in robust growth in import volumes over the past year, with import values around 8 per cent higher over the year to the September quarter. Reflecting the pick-up in business investment, growth in the value of capital imports has been particularly strong, rising by 17 per cent over the year to the September quarter (Graph 41). Imports of civil aircraft have been the largest contributor to the increase over the past year. The value of consumption imports has also risen strongly, and in the September quarter was 15 per cent higher than a year earlier, partly a result of rising imports of motor vehicles. ", " The net income deficit narrowed slightly in the June quarter to 2.8 per cent of GDP, around the level of the past four years. The ratio of net interest payments to exports was also little changed at around 9 per cent. There were large downward revisions to the estimate of net foreign equity liabilities from the September quarter 1998 owing to improved recording of foreign assets held by Australian fund managers (Graph 42). The revised data show that net foreign liabilities have been broadly unchanged at around 55 per cent of GDP for nearly 10 years, in comparison with previous data, which suggested that they had increased over the past few years. In the June quarter, Australia's net foreign debt rose slightly to around 46 per cent of GDP, reflecting a continuation of the recent trend of strong net debt inflow. Net foreign equity liabilities also rose, primarily due to valuation effects, with the Australian share market outperforming those abroad in local currency terms. Net equity outflow was again recorded in the June quarter, consistent with the pattern of the past few years during which flows of Australian offshore equity investment have been strong. ", " In aggregate, commodity prices have been fairly steady, with the RBA Commodity Price Index falling in SDR terms by 0.2 per cent in the three months to October, though the Index rose by 3.4 per cent in Australian dollar <span class=\"no-wrap\">terms (Graph 43)</span>. However, this masks some divergent trends across commodities. Rural commodity prices have increased sharply over the past few months to reach their highest level in over 12 years (Graph 44). Wheat prices recorded significant gains, with unfavourable weather conditions in Australia, North America and Europe constraining world supply. In contrast, beef and veal prices have fallen over the past three months because of the drought, which continues to induce higher slaughter rates both in Australia and the US. Strong demand for wool, coupled with an Australian clip that is expected to be the lowest in five decades, has pushed wool prices higher, with the price around 40 per cent higher than a year earlier. These pressures are expected to moderate, however, as processors substitute away from wool to synthetic yarns. Sugar prices have risen over the past few months from very low levels, though these gains are not expected to be maintained as world sugar production is forecast to be close to record levels in 2002/03. ", " Base metals prices fell in the three months to October to levels near their previous trough in October 2001, largely as a result of the slow recovery in world industrial production. Despite falling over the past six months, nickel prices are still around 27 per cent higher than a year ago, owing mainly to strong demand and tight supply. Most other base metals prices are well below levels of a year ago. Iron ore prices have fallen for most of this year, though they have stabilised in recent months, with increased Chinese steel production raising demand. Falls in prices for coking and thermal coal have also abated recently in line with rising oil and gas prices. ", " Recent movements in the gold price have reflected equity market fluctuations, though tensions in the Middle East have kept the price at a relatively high level. Geopolitical tensions have also been a factor in the volatility in oil prices over the past few months (Graph 45). Other factors influencing the price have included the low levels of US oil inventories and OPEC's decision not to increase its existing production quotas. ", " There has been a small decline in short-term interest rates since the last <em>Statement</em> (Graph 46). For much of the past three months, however, market expectations were for the cash rate target to be unchanged in the near term but to rise by 25 basis points some time prior to the middle of 2003. This view was underpinned by a reasonably constant stream of solid domestic economic news, counterbalanced by concerns about the future impact on the domestic economy of a possible deterioration in global growth prospects. ", " More recently, however, expectations of a rise in the cash rate target in the foreseeable future have disappeared. This shift in expectations has occurred as markets have given greater weight to the possibility that the domestic economy will be weighed down by developments abroad. ", " Long-term market rates have fallen considerably over the past six months, and have moved within a relatively wide range since the previous <em>Statement</em>. Yields on 10-year government bonds stood at around 5.60 per cent in early November, almost one percentage point below the 2002 high of 6.50 per cent recorded in April (Graph 47). In late September bond yields fell to an intra-year low of 5.25 per cent. The driving force behind this decline seemed to be the large falls in share prices in the US and many other major countries, which led to rising risk aversion among investors and concerns about the extent to which global economic growth would be affected. Geopolitical risks added to the uncertainty. ", " The decline in bond yields was partly reversed in mid October, when the recovery in the US stock market caused US bond yields to rise sharply. The yield on Australian 10-year government bonds rose by 50 basis points in a matter of days, to almost 6 per cent. This increase was, however, short-lived with concerns about the global economy again rising to the fore. ", " While day-to-day movements in Australian bonds closely followed those in the US market, the spread between long-term bond yields in Australia and the US widened considerably in net terms over the period, at one point reaching almost 200 basis points (<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>). From mid October, however, the spread narrowed to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">165 basis points</span>, but remains considerably above the average levels of the past few years. ", " Spreads between yields on Australian corporate and government bonds have widened in recent months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 48)</span>, but much of the increase is due to investors' concerns regarding overseas companies (particularly US financial institutions) which have issued bonds in the Australian market. While spreads averaged across all issuers have widened by 10 to 20 basis points, spreads on bonds issued by domestic corporates have risen by just 5 to 10 basis points. Overall, the rise in spreads in the corporate bond market has been much less than that in the US market (Graph 49). ", " Intermediaries' variable indicator interest rates were unchanged during the three months to end October, reflecting a constant cash rate (Table 16). ", " Banks' fixed rates for housing and small business have fallen slightly, although not by as much as the market yields against which they are priced. Although fixed-rate mortgages are now slightly cheaper than banks' standard variable-rate mortgages, the proportion of new loans that are at fixed rates has fallen from 9 per cent in June to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent currently</span>. ", " Issuance of domestic non-government bonds in the September quarter rose to $9.7 billion, 15 per cent above the average level of the past year. There was particularly strong growth in the asset-backed category, with record issuance of $5.8 billion, around double the rate of a couple of years ago (Graph 50). The market has digested this increased supply reasonably well, partly helped by interest from foreign investors. ", " An increasing range of issuers is tapping the market. In particular, there were several issues by non-conforming lenders (those that offer mortgages to relatively high-risk borrowers). In addition, the September quarter saw the first issue of securities backed by loans to medical professionals. ", " In contrast, domestic corporate bond issuance was well down in the September quarter on levels seen earlier this year, although in October issuance picked up due to a $1.5 billion issue by a transport infrastructure company <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 17)</span>. The fall in the September quarter can, in part, be attributed to the recent volatility in financial markets which has led some companies to defer or cancel planned raisings. Notwithstanding this, companies with good credit ratings and recent strong share price performance that have approached the market have found their issues oversubscribed. Issues during the September quarter all carried a credit rating above BBB. ", " The total amount of domestic non-government bonds outstanding currently stands at just under $125 billion, up from just under $100 billion a year ago (Graph 51). This now exceeds the total amount of government securities on issue (Commonwealth and state combined). ", " In addition to domestic issues, Australian entities' offshore issuance has been strong. In the September quarter, Australian entities issued $16 billion of bonds offshore, around 60 per cent more than issued in the domestic market. Banks continue to account for a large proportion (around two-thirds) of the funds raised offshore (Graph 52). These primary raisings have been in a range of foreign currencies, but have mostly been swapped back to Australian dollars. ", " As was the case for the US share market, the recovery in Australian share prices from their post-September <span class=\"no-wrap\">11 lows</span> began to peter out by March (Graph 53). Since then Australian share prices have fallen by 12 per cent. While this is a significant fall, it is only about half that in US share prices over the same period. ", " The fall has come in two broad phases, both of which mirrored developments in US markets. The first extended through to end July. During this period, share prices were undermined by growing concerns about US corporate governance arrangements. Markets staged a sharp, but brief, recovery in August and early September, but by early October had fallen to new lows. This second phase of falling share prices seemed to owe more to concerns that the world economic recovery may be stalling. ", " Overall, the Australian share market has continued to exhibit a good deal more stability than its US counterpart. This is borne out by the pattern of daily price movements. While most daily movements in the ASX 200 were no greater than 1 per cent, the S&amp;P 500 moved by more than this amount on around 70 per cent of trading days during the past three months (Graph 54). Similarly, while options prices suggest that expectations of future share price volatility have risen steadily over the past six months, the Australian market is expected to be considerably less volatile than markets overseas (Graph 55). In the US, expected volatility in recent months has reached levels last seen during the Russian debt default crisis and above the level seen in September 2001. ", " Despite the overall stability of the Australian market over the past three months, share prices of insurance companies have fallen noticeably, dropping 7 per cent to be 37 per cent below their June 2001 peak (Graph 56). Much of the fall reflects concerns about the capitalisation of some insurers' offshore operations, with the weakness in offshore equity markets substantially reducing the value of some insurers' investment portfolios. ", " Banks' share prices have fallen by more than the overall market decline since end July. While banks had previously proved resilient to general equity market weakness, a global sell-off of the banking sector (reflecting concerns that weaker economic growth will impact on the credit quality of banks' assets) has put downward pressure on their share prices. In addition, the market is pricing in some expectation that credit growth will slow (as housing market activity abates) and that this will reduce the banks' future earnings growth. ", " Falls in the share prices of industrial companies also made a substantial contribution to the decline in the overall index. The weakness in the industrial sector reflects, in particular, the impact of the drought on agriculture suppliers and higher oil prices on transport companies. ", " In August and September most of the largest listed companies in Australia reported their results for the <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span> to June this year. In aggregate, reported earnings of the top 100 companies dropped sharply in the first half of 2002 (Table 18), but this fall was more than accounted for by News Corporation's large loss from its investment write-downs. Excluding media companies, earnings rose 13 per cent compared to the first half of 2001. This is a strong performance by international standards. The transport and commercial services sectors performed particularly well. ", " Equity market analysts remain optimistic, expecting further strong profit growth. Although they have revised down their expectations of industrial companies' earnings for the coming 12 months, current expectations are for an 18 per cent rise in full year earnings for 2002, followed by a further 13 per cent rise in 2003. ", " Over the past three months, Australia's ‘as reported’ P/E ratio has declined slightly to 27 but is well above mid 2001 levels and almost as high as recent readings for the US P/E ratio. However, all of this year's net rise in the Australian ratio is attributable to News Corporation. Excluding News Corporation, the ratio is 17 – the lowest level seen since 1996 (Graph 57). ", " At the beginning of October domestic share price indices were re-weighted to move from individual company weights based on total market capitalisation to weights based on free float. Free float is that part of market capitalisation available for purchase after excluding holdings by the government and strategic shareholdings of more than 5 per cent. The re-weighting brings the Australian indices into line with the calculation of indices overseas. International indices published by Morgan Stanley Capital International moved to this weighting method last May. ", " As a result of the changed weights, the measured market capitalisation of the ASX 200 fell by around 7 per cent. Most of this fall occurred in the media industry (a large part of the consumer discretionary sector), reflecting large family holdings in News Corporation (Table 19). Financials now account for 45 per cent of the index. There was an increase in turnover prior to the index change, as funds managers rebalanced their portfolios, with the increase most pronounced for banks and media. ", " Equity raisings were solid during the September quarter, with $4 billion raised (Graph 58). Most of the raisings were through placements and rights issues, with initial public offerings amounting to just $0.6 billion. Buybacks remained moderate and significantly below the levels seen in 1999 and 2000. ", " Growth in margin lending for equities and managed funds slowed considerably in the September quarter after very strong growth in the preceding six months (Table 20). While the number of clients grew, the average loan size fell. In comparison, margin debt in the US fell 11 per cent over the same period. Consistent with the increase in volatility in the Australian market, margin calls were almost double the level seen in the previous quarter but remain a third below their level in the September quarter last year. In line with the overall fall in the share market, the value of security underlying margin debt fell, resulting in a slight increase in the average gearing of borrowers. ", " Financial conditions remain expansionary, with real short-term interest rates below their recent averages. Over the past quarter, some fixed-term borrowing rates charged by intermediaries have declined a little, reflecting falls in nominal bond yields. Other indicators also suggest that financial conditions are supportive of growth; credit growth remains strong, and the real exchange rate is low relative to its historical average. With bond yields falling, however, the yield curve now shows less upward slope which could be interpreted as indicating a reduction in the degree of monetary expansion. The effect of lower yields is also being partially offset by the further declines in equity prices and increases in some corporate yield spreads over the past few months. ", " The cash rate has remained at 4.75 per cent since June, after increasing following the May and June meetings of the Board. Estimates of the real cash rate based on alternative measures of inflation expectations remain lower than recent averages, though there are some noticeable differences among the alternative measures (Table 21). The measure that uses underlying inflation as a proxy for inflation expectations remains around <span class=\"no-wrap\">¾ percentage</span> point below its average over the period since 1997, a period during which inflation has averaged around 2¼ per cent and output growth around 4 per cent. The measure based on inflation expectations derived from the bond market is only a little below its average over this period, reflecting a decline in bond-market inflation expectations over the September quarter. ", " Lending rates of intermediaries are also below recent historical averages, in both real and nominal terms <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 59)</span>. Over the past quarter, fixed interest rates charged by intermediaries have fallen slightly, reflecting the decline in longer-term yields. However, the effect of this on aggregate business capital raising activity should be limited, since the stimulatory impact is offset to some extent by the further falls in equity prices, and by increased yield spreads on lower-rated corporate bonds. Further details on these developments are reported in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’. ", " The slope of the yield curve, as measured by the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates, provides an alternative indication of the stance of policy. A positive-sloping yield curve (or, more correctly, a yield curve with a larger than average positive slope) is normally interpreted as evidence that policy is expansionary since it implies that short-term interest rates are below the level at which they are expected to be on average over the medium term. Currently the slope of Australia's yield curve remains positive, but it has flattened out over the past few months, reflecting lower bond yields (Graph 60). ", " Total credit grew at an annualised rate of 14.1 per cent over the six months to September, an increased pace from the annualised rate of 8¾ per cent over the six months to March (Graph 61). The pick-up in credit growth has reflected some further acceleration in household credit as well as a marked pick-up in the rate of business borrowing. The strength in household credit primarily reflects the rapid growth in housing loans, particularly to investors. ", " Business borrowing grew at an annualised rate of 8 per cent over the six months to September, a considerable increase from the ¾ per cent annualised growth over the preceding six-month period. As detailed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’, this increased fund-raising by businesses – which is also evident in direct market raisings – is consistent with the favourable investment outlook. ", " Growth in the monetary aggregates has moderated over the six months to September, with broad money increasing at an annualised rate of 9 per cent, compared with 11 per cent over the six months to March. Growth in business deposits had been particularly strong, but in the recent period business deposits have barely grown, consistent with the upturn in investment spending. In year-ended terms, growth in money and credit are now more aligned, after a brief period where money growth had outstripped credit (Graph 62). ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International    and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar has appreciated modestly in recent months on a trade-weighted basis. The real trade-weighted exchange rate, which adjusts for inflation in Australia and across our trading partners, has risen by around 6 per cent over the past year. Notwithstanding the recent rise, the current level of the real exchange rate is around 8 per cent below its 1990s' average (Graph 63). ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.7 per cent in the September quarter and by 3.2 per cent over the year (Table 22, Graph 64). Measures of underlying inflation increased by between ½ and ¾ per cent in the quarter and range between 2½ and 3¼ per cent in year-ended terms (Graph 65). The statistical measures based on the quarterly distribution of price changes – the weighted median and the trimmed mean – suggest that underlying inflation is 2½ – 2¾ per cent. In contrast, the exclusion-based measures continue to report underlying inflation towards the top end of this range and, in year-ended terms, were similar to CPI inflation in the September quarter. Measures of the weighted median and trimmed mean calculated from the year-ended rather than the quarterly distribution of price changes, are also running closer to 3 per cent. The divergence between the different measures is arising currently because large quarterly price movements have occurred across a broad range of different items over the past year and are removed from the quarterly-based measure. As it is more likely that these movements reflect a series of one-off factors rather than ongoing inflationary pressures, the Bank's assessment of underlying inflation is that it is currently running at around 2¾ per cent. ", " The largest contributor to the rise in the CPI in the September quarter was an increase of 12 per cent in vegetable prices, partly reflecting the drought. The effects of the drought were also apparent in the 3 per cent fall in beef and veal prices, but are not yet evident for other items such as fruit and bread. In year-ended terms, the most significant contribution to CPI inflation was made by holiday travel &amp; accommodation prices, which increased by almost 13 per cent, owing mainly to increases in the cost of overseas holiday travel, but also reflecting a number of one-off factors such as the introduction of the Ansett and insurance airfare levies at the end of last year. House purchase costs have increased steadily and are now 3¾ per cent higher than a year ago, driven by ongoing strength in the housing market and the effect of the removal of the Commonwealth Additional Grant for first-home buyers. Reflecting large increases in reinsurance premiums, withdrawals of low cost providers from the industry, increased payouts and weaker investment returns, the price of insurance services has also increased steadily to be 4½ per cent higher over the year. This is likely to have contributed to above-average increases in the prices for child care and sports participation in the September quarter. ", " There were a number of price falls in the quarter, including motor vehicle prices which fell by 0.9 per cent in the quarter, to be around ½ per cent lower over the year. Fuel prices also fell by 1.2 per cent in the quarter, though they are 2.3 per cent higher over the year. Pharmaceutical prices fell in the quarter reflecting the seasonal effect of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, though health costs more generally are around 6 per cent higher over the year, owing mainly to higher private health insurance premiums. Audio, visual &amp; computing prices continued to fall, declining by 1.8 per cent in the September quarter to be 4.2 per cent lower than a year earlier. ", " Tradable goods prices were flat in the September quarter, reflecting the influence of subdued world price movements, but were 2¼ per cent higher over the year. In contrast, the strength in the domestic economy has contributed to a general rise in non-tradables inflation over the past year or so, to 4 per cent over the year to the September quarter. ", " Upstream inflationary pressures remain moderate. In the September quarter, final-stage producer prices increased by 0.5 per cent, and were 1.4 per cent higher over the year (Table 23, Graph 66). The largest contributions to the quarterly rise were from increases in building materials prices and the cost of utilities. These price rises were partially offset by falls in the price of meat products. Petrol prices also fell in the quarter, though they have had little effect on final stage producer price inflation over the year. ", " Price increases were less prevalent at the intermediate and preliminary stages of production in the September quarter. Consistent with the pattern for much of this year, domestic price increases in the quarter were small. Rises in iron and steel prices and the cost of technical services, in particular of consultant engineers, were partly offset by significant falls in prices for beef and dairy cattle. Reflecting the depreciation of the exchange rate in the September quarter, the price of imported components, at both the preliminary and intermediate stages of production, rose after falling for much of the past year. The weak world economy appears to be putting continued downward pressure on world prices of a number of manufactured goods, such as industrial machinery and electronic goods. ", " The various business surveys suggest that upstream cost pressures remain muted. Purchase costs as reported in the NAB survey are only picking up slightly, while according to the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers, the net balance of firms experiencing cost increases remains on a downward trend. ", " Most labour cost indicators continue to suggest that wage pressures are subdued though, consistent with the on-going recovery in the labour market, there are some signs that the wage cycle may be near a trough. In the June quarter, growth in the wage cost index (WCI) for total pay edged up in quarterly seasonally adjusted terms, though it remained 3.1 per cent higher than a year earlier (Table 24). At the industry level, the WCI continued to record the fastest annual wage growth in the electricity, gas and water industry (4.0 per cent), and the slowest wage growth in transport and storage (2.5 per cent). Wage growth in property and business services experienced the largest deceleration, falling from a peak of 4.8 per cent in early 2001 to 3.0 per cent, reflecting the weaker labour market outcomes in that sector. ", " Business surveys suggest a leveling out in wage pressures. Total labour costs, as reported in the NAB survey, appear to have reached a trough in year-ended terms in the March quarter although firms expect labour cost growth to pick up only slightly in the near term. The NAB survey reports that businesses are having increasing difficulty attracting suitable labour. The ACCI-Westpac survey tells a similar story, despite an easing in the difficulty of finding suitable labour in the September quarter. ", " Data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations on enterprise bargaining agreements continue to indicate an easing in the pace of wage growth. New federal enterprise agreements ratified in the June quarter provided an average annualised wage increase of 3.6 per cent, down from around 4 per cent a year earlier. The latest reading, however, was weighed down by an unusually high representation of retail sector agreements, which tend to incorporate relatively low wage increases. As the representation of new agreements shifts towards industries which traditionally pay higher wage increases, such as construction and manufacturing, this trend is likely to be reversed. Wage increases for the stock of existing agreements, which have been on a gradual upward trend over the past couple of years, remained at 3.8 per cent in the June quarter. According to the latest Mercer <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em>, executives' base salaries rose by 4.5 per cent over the year to September, at the lower end of the 4½–5 per cent range that has existed over much of the past four years. ", " Differences between the various wage bill measures persist. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings of full-time adults (AWOTE) grew by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.2    per cent</span> higher over the year. (For a discussion of the interpretation of wage-bill measures, refer to <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2002/aug/1.html#box-b\">Box    B</a> of the August 2002 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.) The national accounts measure of compensation per employee grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span> in the June quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.2 per cent</span> higher over the year; on a per hour basis, compensation grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.3 per cen</span>t in the June quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.3 per cent</span> higher over the year. The faster pace over the past year on a per hour basis reflects a decline in average hours worked.

", " Most measures of inflation expectations remain contained. The latest NAB quarterly survey reported that businesses expect inflation in both retail and other final product prices to be 0.4 per cent in the December <span class=\"no-wrap\">quarter (Graph 67)</span>. Similarly subdued expectations were reported in the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers. In contrast, consumer inflation expectations, as measured by the Melbourne Institute survey, rose in October, although this measure of expectations can be volatile. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of investors, as measured by the difference between 10-year bond yields and indexed bonds, have fluctuated between 2 and 2½ per cent in recent months. Financial market economists surveyed by the Bank have revised up their median inflation forecast for the year to June 2003, from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent, following the release of the September quarter CPI data (Table 25). The forecast for median inflation over the following year remains at 2.5 per cent. The median inflation forecast of trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT), has been revised up by ½ percentage point to 3.5 per cent for the year to June 2003, while the median forecast for June 2004 has been revised down marginally to 3.4 per cent. ", " The CPI outcome for the September quarter was generally consistent with the short-term outlook presented in previous <em>Statements</em>, which suggested that underlying inflation was likely to remain close to the target mid-point during the second half of 2002. As discussed above, there continues to be divergence among the different underlying measures, though the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation was around 2¾ per cent over the year to the September quarter, having fallen from a peak of around 3¼ per cent at the end of 2001. ", " Cost and price indicators provide little evidence of any generalised upward pressure on inflation in the short term. Domestic producer prices have moderated over the past 18 months and business surveys continue to report only moderate upstream price rises, although increases in some non-wage business costs, particularly utility and insurance charges, are putting some pressure on business margins. Wage and labour costs also remain contained, but the improvement in the labour market over the course of the past year suggests that these are unlikely to ease any further. ", " Looking further ahead, underlying inflation is expected to remain within the target range. Forecasts presented in previous <em>Statements</em> had envisaged that upward pressure on inflation would develop, with inflation rising gradually to the top of the target range over the next year or so. This assessment embodied expectations of a gradually improving global situation in which the global recovery would become more firmly established. In that scenario, it was expected that the Australian economy would continue to expand at close to its recent pace, which would lead to gradually increasing capacity utilisation and upward pressures on wages and prices. But with the global situation now looking less favourable, some easing in the pace of growth in the Australian economy appears likely in the coming year from the strong pace maintained over the recent period. That being the case, inflation pressures in Australia are expected to be slightly weaker than was embodied in previous forecasts, and hence underlying inflation is now expected to remain close to its recent level over the next year or so. ", " The drought is likely to have a noticeable influence on CPI outcomes in the short term. The principal effect of the drought on inflation will be an increase in food prices, which will keep CPI inflation around the top end of the Bank's target range over the next quarter or so. Underlying inflation, however, is likely to be less affected, and indeed there may be a small dampening impact as a result of the adverse effect of the drought on output growth. Over a longer period, as these temporary effects drop out of the calculation, the rate of CPI inflation is expected to converge towards the underlying measures, and therefore to return to a rate that is within the target range. ", " There are, as always, a number of sources of risk around this forecast. If the global recovery were to regain momentum, somewhat stronger growth in the Australian economy could be expected and hence capacity pressures could well emerge within the forecast period. This would see a somewhat higher inflation outcome than the one envisaged in the current forecast. Reinforcing this risk is that, as noted above, CPI inflation is likely to remain around 3 per cent in the near term and, given relatively firm demand conditions, this could become embodied in ongoing inflation expectations of wage and price setters. On the other hand, a slower-than-expected world recovery would have adverse effects on Australian growth, as well as generating additional downward pressure on world prices, which would result in inflation declining toward the lower end of the target range. At present these risks appear to be evenly balanced. ", " Over the course of this year, conditions have been extremely dry across a wide stretch of the country. The drought has severely reduced winter-crop production and brought forward livestock slaughtering, and will significantly curtail farm output and incomes. ", " The direct effects of the drought will be most evident in a decline in agricultural production and an associated reduction in rural exports (around two-thirds of agricultural production is exported). However, fluctuations in rural exports tend not to be as pronounced as those of agricultural production as rural exports include output of the forestry and fishing industries, as well as processed agricultural products. In addition, agricultural inventories tend to be run down during periods of drought. The reduction in farm incomes will translate into lower farm consumption and investment (farm equipment is, on average, around 8 per cent of total machinery and equipment investment spending). Although difficult to quantify, the drought will also have indirect effects on the economy, most particularly in those industries that supply and service agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail operations in rural areas.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " The adverse effect of a drought on production varies across the different parts of the farm sector. Drought conditions lead to an immediate reduction in grain production, whereas a downturn in meat production tends to occur with some delay as farmers initially increase slaughter rates in response to the rising cost of feed. Conversely, crop production recovers faster than meat production following the breaking of a drought, with meat production delayed by the need to rebuild stock numbers. Similarly, there are differing effects on rural commodity prices, with wheat and other grain prices initially rising, reflecting the reduced supply, and meat prices initially falling; the reverse price movements typically occur following the cessation of the drought. ", " To provide some guidance as to the likely effects of the current drought on the economy, it is useful to examine the effect of earlier droughts. Although changing weather conditions are an ever-present source of volatility in agricultural production, two particularly severe droughts are identifiable in the past 20 years: the first in 1982–1983, which affected eastern and southern Australia; and the second, a series of low-rainfall years from 1991 to 1995, during which several regions across Australia experienced varying degrees of drought conditions at different times. In both episodes, agricultural production and rural exports declined significantly and then recovered strongly following the breaking of the drought (Graph A1). The sharp fall and subsequent rise in agricultural production during the 1982–1983 drought first subtracted, and subsequently added, around 1–1½ percentage points to GDP growth (Graph A2). In the 1991–1995 drought, GDP was reduced by around ½–¾ percentage point in both 1991/92 and 1994/95, and was subsequently boosted by around ¾ percentage point in 1995/96. ", " Based on the latest Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) estimates of crop and livestock production, agricultural production could fall by close to 15 per cent in 2002/03, more than half the fall experienced in 1982/83 and close to the falls in 1991/92 and 1994/95. The smaller expected fall in production in the current episode in part reflects improvements in cropping techniques since the 1980s, which have enabled farmers to cope more effectively with adverse weather conditions.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> Another factor reducing the impact on the aggregate economy is that the share of agricultural production in GDP has fallen from around 6 per cent in the early 1980s to just over 3 per cent in recent years. Nevertheless, the forecast decline in production would still directly subtract around ½ a percentage point from aggregate economic growth in 2002/03 and as much as 1 percentage point from growth over the year to June 2003. ", " Fluctuations in farm incomes – that is, the proceeds of sales net of operating costs – tend to be of considerably larger magnitude than the fluctuations in production. In September, ABARE estimated that farm incomes will be around 60 per cent lower in 2002/03 than the relatively high levels in the previous year. To some extent, the increased use of Farm Management Deposits (FMD) in recent years has provided scope for farmers to smooth their income and expenditures. The recent high levels of farm income have facilitated a large build-up of FMDs, which should help insulate farmers from some of the effects of the expected fall in earnings. Nonetheless, a significant decline in expenditure by rural producers can be expected as a consequence of the drought. ", " While the drought is a serious negative shock to the economy, past experience suggests that there will subsequently be a significant boost to growth when the drought breaks, as crop production typically rebounds strongly following drought years. In the past, El Niño episodes have tended to start towards the middle of the calendar year and last a little less than 12 months. At this stage, the Bureau of Meteorology expects drier-than-average conditions to persist in much of the country for at least the next several months. ", " Movements in Australian bond yields on a day-to-day basis are heavily influenced by movements in US bond yields (Graph B1). Moreover, a significant share of the daily movement in Australian yields tends to occur overnight. Since June, for example, the absolute daily change in Australian 10-year bond yields has averaged almost 6 basis points during the overnight trading session. The comparable figure for the Australian day session is less than 3 basis points. And even movements during the Australian day often track very closely movements in US Treasuries traded in Tokyo. ", " Despite this close correlation, the spread between Australian and US yields has widened considerably over the course of 2002. At one point in October it reached almost 200 basis points, after having been around 90 basis points at the beginning of the year (Graph B2). In early November the spread narrowed somewhat to around 165 basis points. ", " The widening of the spread can be attributed largely to the difference in the growth outlook for the two countries. This is suggested by movements in real bond yields obtained from 10-year indexed government bonds (Graph B3). In the United States real yields fell by around 1 percentage point between June and early October, to a low of just 2 per cent. This fall can be presumed to reflect one or both of two factors: concerns about future growth prospects for the US economy, which would imply that market interest rates would be low for an extended period; and/or a reduced tolerance for risk, with greater appetite by investors to hold ‘riskless’ assets. While real rates rose in the second half of October on the back of relatively positive corporate earnings announcements, they remain significantly below their levels earlier in the year. In contrast, real yields in Australia have been much more stable. The resulting widening of the real yield spread accounts for all the widening of the nominal spread. ", " Interestingly, most of the movement in the Australian–US spread has occurred in the overnight trading session, rather than in the Australian day (Table B1). This reflects the recent tendency for Australian bond yields to fall by less than US yields on days that US yields decline. This is consistent with the stronger economic indicators in Australia relative to those in the United States. In net terms, the spread has moved little during the Australian trading day since the end of June. ", " The previous occasion on which the yield spread increased by a significant amount for a sustained period was in the first half of 1994. In contrast to the current episode, on that occasion it was concern about the inflation outlook in Australia that was largely responsible; during the course of 1994 the expected inflation rate (calculated from bond yields) rose by almost 2 percentage points to nearly 5 per cent. In the current episode, expected inflation has, in net terms, changed little (Graph B4); while it declined from end June to early September, it has subsequently increased back to around 2½ per cent, a level consistent with the Bank's medium-term inflation target.

The recovery in the major economies has so far remained patchy, and information becoming available in the first half of the year tended to suggest that the likelihood of a more extended period of global weakness was increasing. During that period an additional source of external risk was presented by a strongly rising Australian dollar. Against this background, the Board took the view at its June meeting that the economy had entered a period where the monetary policy decision would be whether to hold interest rates unchanged or to reduce them. This assessment was made public shortly afterwards at the Governor's Parliamentary appearance on 6 June. Within the context of this broad strategic assessment, the Board judged at the time of the June meeting that the case for an easing was not sufficiently strong and, in the event, subsequent developments tended to weaken that case further, so that the cash rate was again held unchanged at the July and August meetings. ", " In broad outline the domestic non-farm economy remains in a strong condition, as is evident from a round-up of the major economic aggregates. Growth of non-farm GDP over the latest four quarters for which we have data was just over 4 per cent; domestic demand, while slowing a little from its most recent peak, expanded by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5½ per cent</span> over that period; employment growth over the past year has been around trend, though lower in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained close to the lower end of the range in which it has fluctuated over the past two decades. Inflation, both as measured by the CPI and according to most underlying measures, is currently 2¾ per cent, slightly above the target mid-point. ", " While the Australian economy remains in a position to perform relatively well against a weak international background, the pace of growth of the non-farm economy is likely to ease during the remainder of 2003. The growth of domestic demand is now in the process of slowing from its recent rapid pace, and in the short term this is unlikely to be offset by stronger external conditions. As a result, a slowing in the overall growth of non-farm GDP is expected, bringing it below trend during the course of 2003, before growth returns to around trend the following year. With conditions in the farm sector improving, the growth in total GDP should pick up earlier than the non-farm component. In the short term, since the Australian economy is still growing more strongly than its trading partners, this scenario would probably see some further widening of Australia's current account deficit. Underlying inflation is expected to decline to around 2 per cent next year as the effects of the exchange rate appreciation work through, though on a longer time scale, trends in domestic labour costs are seen as consistent with inflation returning to around the middle of the target. In summary then, the outlook is for a temporary period of below-trend growth with inflation below the target mid-point. This follows a period in which growth and inflation have both been above those norms. ", " On its own, this outlook does not present a strong case for interest rates to be lower than they currently are. Australia's flexible inflation-targeting framework does not aim to fine-tune economic outcomes, but rather is designed to ensure that inflation remains on track over the medium term. This being the case, an inflation rate that is expected to move a modest distance away from the target mid-point would not of itself be a trigger for policy action, provided the medium-term outlook is consistent with the target. In the current context, the expectation of a temporary period of lower growth and inflation may well point to a case for monetary policy to be on the expansionary side of neutral, as it already is, but it is not of itself a case for moving to a more expansionary stance than is currently in place. That said, the current outlook would not stand in the way of a reduction in interest rates should a broader consideration of the balance of risks require it. ", " The key risks raising the possibility of an easing in monetary policy over recent months have been external. One is a possible failure of the world (particularly the US) economy to pick up. The central economic outlook described above is based on an assumed pick-up in global growth in the second half of 2003, along the lines that is widely incorporated in conventional forecasts. If the global economy were to fall short of those expectations it would further set back prospects for a recovery in Australia's exports. A second source of risk would be a further sharp appreciation of the Australian dollar, which might be driven by additional interest rate reductions around the world to combat a weakening global economy. If this occurred, it would have an additional contractionary effect on the export sector, as well as further dampening inflation. ", " Both of these risks increased appreciably in the first half of the year, with the international economic data generally disappointing and the Australian dollar on a strong upward trend during that period, particularly during May. More recent developments, however, suggest that the risks from these two sources have lessened. ", " First, regarding the global outlook, there have been some slightly more encouraging signs recently. Economic data in the United States have been a little more positive, showing, among other things, stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter, improvements in business sentiment, a rise in capital goods orders and a small pick-up in industrial production in the past couple of months, though the performance of the labour market has so far remained disappointing. While the signs of improvement are still tentative at this stage, they have been accompanied by a noticeable lift in sentiment in international financial markets. Bond yields around the world have increased sharply over the past two months, reversing the declines that occurred earlier in the year. In the US, yields are now over 100 basis points above the troughs reached in early June. Equity prices have also increased over the past few months to be more than 20 per cent above their recent troughs in most major international markets. Thus financial markets are now taking a more optimistic reading of economic prospects than was the case a couple of months ago. ", " Second, the strong upward trend in the exchange rate seen during the first half of the year has not continued. The exchange rate against the US dollar peaked at US68.5 cents in early July, but it subsequently came down quite sharply, falling by almost 4 cents in the middle of the month, and has shown little net change since. On a trade-weighted basis, the exchange rate is now around 4 per cent below its recent peak. The significance of this is not so much the new level of the exchange rate as the apparent change in direction and market sentiment. The strong rise in the currency in the first six months of the year had been driven by investors chasing yields in the more stable economies, in what was a deteriorating climate for the world economy and share markets. More recently, however, investors have started to position themselves for a growth pick-up, and capital has flowed back into the US economy. This has taken the upward pressure off the Australian dollar. The same sort of sentiment can be seen within the share market, as investors have moved out of ‘defensive’ stocks (i.e. stocks thought likely to do well in an economic downturn) to ‘cyclical’ stocks which will respond best to a pick-up in economic activity. ", " For the present, then, the downside risks to the Australian economy from external sources appear less severe than they were a couple of months ago. Nonetheless, developments in these areas are subject to ongoing change and will continue to have a strong bearing on the policy assessment in the period ahead. ", " An additional complication for Australian monetary policy at present is posed by the rapid growth of credit and its flow-through into strongly rising housing prices. Currently, credit to the household sector is growing at an annual rate of about 20 per cent, well in excess of what could be considered sustainable in the medium to longer <span class=\"no-wrap\">term (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#credit-growth\">Credit Growth</a>’ for a detailed discussion)</span>. Much of this is flowing into the housing sector and is fuelling a rate of housing price increases of the order of 20–25 per cent around the country. Apart from inner Melbourne where apartment prices are falling, there are few signs yet of these pressures easing off. The latest indicators of housing prices continue to show strong growth in most areas, and new finance approvals for housing have been accelerating in the past few months. ", " The risk presented by these developments is that, the longer they go on, the larger will be the contractionary effect on the economy when they inevitably turn. Banks report that they are taking a prudent approach to lending for housing, with property loans well collateralised to withstand a fall in housing prices and significant safety margins built into households' loan repayments. But increasingly there are signs of worrying practices elsewhere in the financial system. This is not untypical of a prolonged bull market, and could cause a good deal of distress to the economy when the housing price cycle turns. ", " Alongside the borrowing for the purchase of housing assets, there is the phenomenon of housing equity withdrawal, whereby households are borrowing against rising housing values to fund other forms of spending. This process is estimated to have been augmenting household cash flows in the past year by around 4 per cent. In the short term, absent an adverse shock, this is likely to continue, thereby supporting demand growth. But were Australia to enter at some stage a period of declining housing prices, it is likely that this equity withdrawal would be scaled back, or would possibly go into reverse, resulting in a cutback in spending, with a potentially destabilising effect on the broader economy. The risk of a large impact from such an event will be greater the longer these current trends in credit and housing markets persist. ", " The current situation, in summary, suggests an outlook that is consistent with the medium-term inflation target but subject to two broad sources of risk – the potential for further weakness arising from external factors, and the destabilising influence of a growing imbalance in the domestic credit market. These two factors have conflicting implications for monetary policy, since lower interest rates would help to offset the first of these risks but would amplify the second. In its policy deliberations the Board has had to take into account the balance of these risks and the way they have evolved over time. ", " The Board's assessment at the time of its June meeting was that the balance of risks had shifted to a point where a case for reducing the cash rate needed to be brought under consideration. On balance, however, it was judged at that time that the case for an easing in policy was not sufficiently strong, so that the cash rate was held unchanged pending an assessment of further developments. While the situation is still subject to considerable uncertainty, the external risks to the economy seem subsequently to have receded, at least for the time being, with global prospects looking a little better and the exchange rate no longer rising quickly as it had in the first half of the year. At the same time, the risks posed by developments in credit and asset markets have not diminished. Given these considerations, and the current assessment of the economic outlook, the case for an easing was judged to have weakened since June, and thus the cash rate was again kept unchanged at both the <span class=\"no-wrap\">July and August</span> meetings. ", " Developments in the global economy were disappointing in the first half of the year, with little or no growth in Europe and only modest growth in the US, although most forecasters continue to expect a solid recovery in the second half of the year. In east Asia, China continues to record strong growth, although elsewhere the pace of growth has generally slowed. The latest Consensus forecasts are for GDP growth in the G7 group of countries of 1½ per cent in 2003, similar to that achieved last year, rising to 2½ per cent in 2004 (Graph 1). While downside risks to these forecasts remain, recent data in the United States have been slightly more encouraging and, in response, equity markets and bond yields have recorded solid increases (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’). In contrast, the recent European data provide little cause for near-term optimism. ", " Given the disappointing growth outcomes over the first half of 2003, policy settings in the major economies have become more expansionary. The Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada have all cut their policy rates in the past three months, as have central banks in many Asian economies. In addition, in a number of countries, fiscal policy has become more expansionary. ", " The US economy has continued to recover from the recession in 2001, though the pace of growth slowed a little in the first half of the year, with GDP increasing by 2.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 2</span>, <span class=\"no-wrap\">Table 1)</span>. In part, this outcome reflects the continuing headwinds arising from the unwinding of the excesses of the late 1990s and the reduced appetite for risk by executives following the corporate governance scandals. In response to the slow recovery, macro policy settings have become very expansionary. Nominal interest rates are at historical lows and new fiscal measures have shifted the budget into a sizeable deficit. Recently, financial conditions have also become more supportive of growth, with the stock market recording significant gains and the US dollar depreciating in trade-weighted terms. ", " It is too early to tell with certainty whether the headwinds are dissipating to allow the expansionary policy settings and easier financial conditions to deliver a pick-up in the pace of growth. Nevertheless, there have been some positive signs of late. Manufacturing production rose in both May and June, with capacity utilisation edging up from its recent trough. Sentiment in the manufacturing industry, as measured by the ISM survey, has also improved to levels consistent with increases in production, and orders of durable goods have recently looked a little stronger. ", " Consumption has also continued to grow at a reasonable pace, to be up by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 3)</span>. It has been underpinned by low interest rates and the associated pick-up in mortgage refinancing, along with solid growth in wages. While consumer sentiment fell in July, it still clearly exceeds its recent lows associated with the war in Iraq. ", " Fiscal policy has become more expansionary over the past year, with the recent fiscal package contributing to an estimated federal budget deficit of just over 4 per cent of GDP this year, up from around 1½ per cent in 2002. Key elements of the package are the acceleration of scheduled income tax cuts and the reduction of the income tax rate on dividends and capital gains. All up, these tax cuts will cost <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$350 billion</span> (around 3.2 per cent of annual GDP) over the next five years, of which nearly half is to be implemented over the next year. ", " Two areas of the US economy that have been weak are business investment and employment, although recent data have been more positive. Following falls over the past two and a half years, business investment recorded an increase of 1.7 per cent in the June quarter (Graph 4). Investment in structures increased for the first time since the September quarter of 2001, although it remains at historically low levels as a share of GDP. Equipment investment also rose in the quarter, underpinned by strong spending on computer equipment, to be 3.8 per cent higher than a year ago. In addition, residential investment increased solidly in the quarter, to be up by <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.6 per cent</span> on its year-ago level and forward-looking indicators suggest a continuation of high levels of activity in the housing sector. ", " Employment has fallen further in recent months and the unemployment rate has risen to 6.2 per cent, around the highest rate in nearly a decade. The pace of decline in employment has, however, slowed recently and job losses are noticeably less widespread across sectors than was the case earlier in the year. There are also signs that new claims for unemployment benefits have begun to fall. ", " With oil prices dropping after the onset of war in Iraq, year-ended consumer price inflation slowed to 2.1 per cent in June (Graph 5). Core inflation also eased to 1.5 per cent over the year to June as growth in services prices edged lower and goods prices fell by 1.9 per cent. Stating that the risk of a substantial fall in inflation was greater than the risk of a substantial rise, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1 per cent in June. ", " Recent indicators in Japan have been slightly more positive than those earlier in the year, with business sentiment and profits looking stronger. Despite little growth in production, business investment rose strongly in the March quarter and the Tankan survey measure of investment intentions in the manufacturing sector lifted in the June quarter. Machinery orders have also picked up in recent months. ", " In contrast, the services sector has shown few signs of improvement with the Tertiary Activity Index remaining broadly flat. The labour market has also remained weak, with the unemployment rate continuing to hover around 5¼ to 5½ per cent, as has been the case for the past 18 months or so. ", " Japan continues to experience deflation, although recently some temporary factors have slowed the decline in consumer prices. The CPI fell by 0.4 per cent over the year to June, compared with falls of nearly 1 per cent in the past few years. However, fresh food, petroleum products and medical expenses (which have risen temporarily due to health sector reforms) accounted for most of the apparent slowing in the rate of deflation. In contrast to consumer prices, the GDP deflator has fallen particularly sharply, to be 3¼ per cent lower over the year to March. The level of nominal GDP is now lower than it was in 1995 and this is complicating the challenge of correcting Japan's ongoing business and bank balance sheet problems (Graph 6). ", " After a strong performance during 2002, growth in most of the economies of non-Japan Asia has weakened so far in 2003 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 2)</span>. The slowdown was evident prior to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and was most evident in consumption growth. This was particularly the case in Korea, where policy initiatives aimed at restraining household borrowing contributed to a decline in consumption of 2 per cent in the March quarter. ", " In the June quarter a number of economies in the region were affected by SARS, although with the outbreak now contained, signs of a recovery are evident, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a> on ‘SARs’). Notwithstanding recent weakness in the region, both Thailand and China continue to record relatively healthy growth, despite some slowing of late. In China, GDP grew by just under 7 per cent in the year to the June quarter, with the value of exports increasing by around 35 per cent over the year (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> on ‘China and International Trade’). ", " Consistent with the generally weaker outcomes across the region, consumer price inflation has slowed in most countries and labour markets appear to have softened. The unemployment rate rose to a record high in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Hong Kong</span> in June and was also up in Korea over recent months. These weaker outturns across the region and the outbreak of SARS prompted several countries to implement supplementary fiscal packages. Malaysia released a package worth around 2 per cent of GDP, and measures introduced by Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan amounted to approximately 1 per cent of GDP in each case. In addition, monetary policy has been loosened in most countries in recent months. ", " New Zealand GDP grew by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter to be 4 per cent higher over the year. Domestic demand, which had been strong for several quarters, has, however, lost some momentum recently. Net exports have been little changed over the year, although merchandise exports have fallen over the past few months. The value of retail trade has also weakened recently. Year-ended inflation slowed further to 1.5 per cent in the June quarter, partly due to the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar and the recent decline in oil prices. Against this background, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut official interest rates by 25 basis points in both June and July to 5.0 per cent. ", " The euro area economy appears to have all but stalled after showing some tentative signs of recovery earlier last year. Output rose only marginally in the March quarter, to be 0.9 per cent higher than a year ago, with little sign of improvement in prospect for the June quarter (Table 3). Export weakness, partly related to the appreciation of the euro, has been a key factor, as has the continuing contraction in investment spending. Industrial production has also fallen in recent months to be back around its end 2001 level, and business sentiment has generally shown renewed weakness (Graph 7). Conditions remain particularly unfavourable in Germany and have now worsened in France, with falling production and exports and a pronounced weakening in business sentiment in recent months. ", " Household consumption has been one of the few areas showing positive, albeit modest, growth in the euro region. While recent retail sales figures point to continuing growth in consumption in the near term, the poor state of the labour market and low levels of consumer confidence are likely to crimp future household <span class=\"no-wrap\">spending (Graph 7)</span>. The unemployment rate for the euro area as a whole stood at 8.9 per cent in June, up almost 1 percentage point from the late 2001 trough. This has resulted in some slowing in labour cost growth, with the area-wide measure of labour costs 2.8 per cent higher over the year to the March quarter, compared with an increase of 3.7 per cent over the year to the December quarter. ", " Euro area consumer price inflation was 1.9 per cent in the year to July (Graph 8). Given an absence of inflationary pressures and weak economic conditions, the ECB cut its key policy rate by 50 basis points to 2 per cent in June. This followed a clarification by the ECB in May that its monetary policy strategy is to aim for year-ended inflation below, but close to, 2 per cent. Efforts have also been made recently to maintain expansionary fiscal policy settings. Despite an ‘excessive’ deficit under the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, Germany intends to implement additional tax cuts early in 2004. ", " Economic activity in the United Kingdom has been more buoyant than in the euro area for the past few years. More recently, however, growth has also slowed, with GDP increasing by 0.3 per cent in the June quarter, after posting little growth in the previous quarter, to be 1.8 per cent higher over the year. A major contributor to the weakening has been a drop-off in the pace of household spending, as wages growth and the rate of increase in housing prices have both slowed. On the production side of the economy, manufacturing output looks to have stabilised after two years of contraction, partly as the result of the depreciation of the pound against the euro. Overall, the labour market remains firm, with the claimant measure of the unemployment rate at 3.1 per cent in June, close to historical lows. ", " Inflation in the United Kingdom has slowed recently. In June, year-ended retail price inflation was 2.8 per cent, down from 3 per cent earlier in the year. Year-ended growth in the harmonised measure of prices, which is comparable to the measure targeted by the ECB, has slowed more sharply to be 1.1 per cent, down from <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span> at the beginning of the year. On average, the harmonised measure has been ¾ of a percentage point below the retail series, although the differential between these measures has widened recently. Citing weak external demand and the prospect of below-trend growth, the Bank of England cut official interest rates by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points in July</span>. ", " Soon after the previous <em>Statement</em> was published, sentiment in financial markets began to deteriorate noticeably. Markets were worried by the fact that incoming economic data were on the weaker side of expectations in both the US and Europe. They also interpreted statements from the US Federal Reserve around that time as indicating that the Fed was increasingly concerned about the possibility of deflation in the US economy and that it might buy long-term bonds to add to monetary stimulus. The impact of this was most pronounced on bond yields, though there was also a pause in the recovery in the US share market that had been underway and the US dollar weakened further. ", " Market pessimism intensified through to the first half of June, with bond yields falling to their lowest level for about 50 years. Thereafter, however, the situation began to change. A trigger for this was the release of consumer price data which showed a significant increase for the month of May, reducing market concerns about deflation. This was reinforced later in June by economic data which showed that the economy was not deteriorating further and by the Fed's decision to cut official interest rates by 25 basis points rather than the <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 basis points</span> that had been widely anticipated. All this served to restore some confidence in prospects for a recovery in US growth in the second half of 2003. In the process, bond yields rose and, by late July, they had more than reversed the fall that had occurred since May. Share markets also resumed their rise, and the US dollar recovered somewhat. ", " All in all, sentiment in financial markets has swung quite widely in the period since the last <em>Statement</em>, from gloomy in the first half of the period to more positive in the second half. ", " After being relatively stable at around 4 per cent over April, US yields on 10-year treasury bonds fell to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.1 per cent</span> by mid June (Graph 9). This was the largest fall in such a short period since the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in late 1998. Since mid June, however, yields have risen back to 4.3 per cent, for the reasons noted above (Graph 10). The movements over the period (both up and down) were amplified by ‘convexity’ trading associated with mortgage-backed securities. ", " Yields in most other countries took their lead from the US. In Europe, yields on German 10-year government debt fell by nearly 60 basis points over May and early June to an 80-year low of just under 3.5 per cent, before rising to around 4.2 per cent by late July. With the outlook for growth in the euro area remaining fairly subdued, German bond yields are now below those in the US after having been around 30 basis points higher for much of the past year. ", " The rise in yields on government bonds was particularly sharp in Japan. After reaching a new low of a little over 0.4 per cent in mid June, yields rose to an intraday high of 1.4 per cent very quickly, before falling back to around 0.9 per cent. ", " Despite these gyrations in yields on government bonds, the willingness to take credit risk has not diminished. Spreads on US corporate debt to US Treasuries have stabilised after falling significantly over the later part of 2002 and in the first few months of 2003 (Graph 11). While spreads are now generally at levels well below those seen during 2002, they remain above the average of the 1990s. The switch by investors out of mortgage securities and into government securities following the announcement by Freddie Mac (the US's second largest mortgage finance provider) that several of its senior executives had left in the face of accounting irregularities, has caused the spread of US agency securities to US Treasuries to rise, from around 30 basis points to around 50 basis points. ", " Yield spreads between emerging market sovereign debt and US Treasuries have remained relatively low over the past three months in most markets (Graph 12). Latin American spreads have held steady at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">500 basis</span> points, well down on their peak of around 1,000 basis points around the time of the Argentinian and Brazilian crises; Asian spreads are currently around 200 basis points. ", " A number of central banks eased monetary policy around the middle of the year (Table 4). In the US, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</span> cut the Fed funds target by 25 basis points to 1 per cent at its meeting in late June. In Europe, the European Central Bank reduced its official interest rate in June by 50 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent;</span> the Bank of England also lowered its policy rate in July by 25 basis points to 3½ per cent; and official interest rates in Sweden declined by 75 basis points to 2¾ per cent in moves of 50 and 25 basis points in <span class=\"no-wrap\">June and July</span>. ", " Other central banks to ease included the Bank of Canada which cut its policy rate by 25 basis points in July to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.0 per cent</span>, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which cut a further 25 basis points to 5.00 per cent in July, after similar-sized cuts in April and June. ", " The Bank of Japan raised the target for bank reserves held at the central bank in May to <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>27–30 trillion from <span class=\"no-wrap\"><span class=\"yen\">¥</span>22–27 trillion</span>. It also announced in June that it would purchase up to <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>1 trillion of asset-backed securities from commercial banks. This is equivalent to around 1 per cent of the central bank's assets. ", " Elsewhere in the Asian region, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Hong Kong all lowered official interest rates, while Singapore announced that it too would ease monetary policy by lowering the target trading band for the Singapore dollar. In Latin America, Brazil moved to lower official interest rates back towards more accommodative levels following earlier increases aimed at supporting the Brazilian real. ", " After reaching multi-year lows in mid March, the major global equity indices have rallied significantly over recent months, initially due to declining concerns about the Iraq war and, more recently, to greater confidence in a global economic recovery in the second half of 2003 (Graph 13). ", " In the US, the S&amp;P 500 has risen by 21 per cent since its March trough, while the Nasdaq has risen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span>. In 2003 to date, the respective increases are 10 per cent and 24 per cent. These rises follow declines in each of the previous three years. ", " The price-earnings (P/E) ratio for the S&amp;P has stabilised at around 30, though it remains at a level well above its long-run average of 14 (Graph 14). Operating earnings for the June quarter came in slightly ahead of expectations on average and they have now reversed about three-quarters of the fall seen in 2000 and 2001. Company analysts are expecting further strong growth in earnings over the next few quarters, based on a more optimistic outlook for the US economy and the latest company earnings reports (Graph 15). If realised, the falls that occurred in the earlier period would have been fully reversed. ", " Movements in share prices in the other major countries have generally followed those in the US. The European Euro STOXX index has increased by around 30 per cent from its March low. The relatively stronger rebound in European share prices may be due to the fact that the decline over the previous nine months had been larger for Europe than for the US (Table 5). The Japanese Topix is also up around 20 per cent. Stock markets in emerging economies have also recovered; share prices in Asian emerging economies rose by around 17 per cent, while in Latin America, they increased by a more modest 8 per cent. ", " After falling quite sharply in May – owing largely to weaker-than-expected US economic data and comments by US administration officials which were perceived by the market as a softening of the ‘strong dollar’ stance of the US – the US dollar stabilised in early June before appreciating towards the end of the period. The recent appreciation appears to reflect growing confidence that the economic recovery in the US will be stronger than in the other major economies. The US dollar, as measured by the major currency trade weighted index has fallen by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">17 per cent</span> from its peak in early 2002. The broader measure of the US TWI, which reflects currency moves against all significant trading partners, has not adjusted down as much. This is mainly because some of these countries have exchange rates which are directly fixed to, or closely managed against, the US dollar. ", " Similar to the pattern that has been evident over the past year, much of the movement of the US dollar has been against European and dollar bloc currencies (Graph 16 and Table 6). Against the Japanese yen, the US dollar has been broadly stable as the Bank of Japan has been intervening heavily to limit any appreciation in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">yen (Graph 17)</span>. As a result, the Bank of Japan's holdings of foreign exchange reserves have risen significantly further in recent months. Likewise, there has been little movement in a number of Asian currencies against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar (for a discussion of the Chinese renminbi  see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>)</span>. ", " The exchange rate of the Australian dollar rose strongly through the first half of 2003. This was a consequence of negative sentiment toward the US economy and the associated depreciation in the US dollar, together with the continuing strong performance of the Australian economy. With interest rates falling to very low levels in the US, global investors focused on investments with a yield pick-up. In addition to Australian dollar denominated assets, demand for assets in other floating currencies with positive interest differentials relative to the US was also strong. Interestingly, the differences in the size of the interest differential among countries did not seem to have much impact on the rate of appreciation of the respective currencies. For example, the Australian, Canadian and <span class=\"no-wrap\">New Zealand dollars</span> all increased by similar amounts against the US dollar over the six months, even though Canada's interest differential relative to the US was a lot less than that of Australia and only about half that of New Zealand. ", " Hedging activity by Australian exporters appears to have been supportive of the Australian dollar over the past year. According to the NAB quarterly business survey, mining companies increased their hedging of exposures from less than 10 per cent a year ago to just under 30 per cent in June (Table 7). This would have involved these companies buying Australian dollars in excess of that stemming from the conversion of export receipts. Of the firms that were hedging, a majority reported a favourable hedging position relative to the current exchange rate. ", " The Australian dollar reached a peak of US68.5 cents in early July, but then fell sharply, by around US4 cents in a little over a week (Graphs 18 and 19). This was part of a general correction experienced by several other currencies around this time. It seems to have been associated with a waning in the importance of interest differentials in relation to capital flows. With sentiment about the outlook for the US economy improving at that time, financial markets increasingly began to look towards the relative prospects for growth. Capital seemed to flow back to the US, as investors moved out of investments that had relatively high yields to those which would benefit from a pick-up in world (and particularly US) economic activity. Within share markets in various countries, the same sentiment could be seen as investors moved out of ‘defensive’ stocks (i.e. those that would be least affected by a downturn in economic activity) to ‘cyclical’ stocks which would benefit most from stronger activity. The exchange rate against the US dollar was a little under US65 cents in early August. ", " In trade-weighted terms, movements in the Australian dollar were more muted than those in relation to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span>, though only a little more so. With most Asian currencies moving closely with the US dollar over the period, and these currencies having a large weight in the Australian dollar TWI, over 70 per cent of the TWI was in effect determined by movements in the US dollar. In early August, the TWI was around 58, a little above its post-float average of 57.5. ", " The RBA continued to rebuild its foreign currency reserves by making purchases over the past few months which more than covered the Government's requirements. In the three months to July, net purchases amounted to around $1.4 billion, while earnings on foreign reserves added a further $0.5 billion. Valuation effects, however, reduced reserves by $0.9 billion. Net reserves currently stand at around $12.2 billion. The Bank also made substantial use of foreign exchange swaps during the past few months to manage domestic liquidity. The swap position currently stands at $35.1 billion. Total reserve holdings (i.e. reserves held outright plus reserves held under swap agreements) currently total $47.3 billion. ", " The Australian economy has continued to expand at a moderate rate, although the pace of growth has slowed over recent quarters, largely due to the weak world economy and the effect of the drought. The latest national accounts show that real GDP rose by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter, to be 2.9 per cent higher than a year earlier (Table 8). The pace of domestic demand growth has eased from the rapid rate seen in 2002, as dwelling investment has levelled off and consumption growth has moderated to a more sustainable pace (Graph 20). In contrast, the upswing in business investment remains strong despite a small decline in the March quarter. ", " The effect of the drought and weak external demand can be most clearly seen in the international trade <span class=\"no-wrap\">figures (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#balance-of-payments\">Balance of Payments</a>’)</span>. Over the year to the March quarter, net exports subtracted <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 percentage points</span> from GDP growth, partly offsetting the strong growth of private final demand of <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.5 per cent</span>. The effect of the drought can also be seen in farm output, which fell by around one-third over the year to the March quarter, subtracting 1.1 percentage points from aggregate GDP growth. Excluding the farm sector, GDP grew by slightly more than 4 per cent over the year to the March quarter. ", " The sharp contrast between the strength of domestic demand and weak external demand is expected to diminish gradually in the year ahead. Domestic demand is expected to grow less quickly over 2003 than over 2002, but the pace of growth should still be solid. Dwelling investment is likely to decline a little in coming quarters, after a period of strong expansion. In contrast, resilient investment intentions and a considerable stock of work in the pipeline suggest that growth in business investment should remain reasonably strong in the period ahead. Consumption remains supported by rising incomes and buoyant confidence levels. In line with overall developments in domestic demand, growth in imports is expected to ease in the period ahead, while exports are expected to return to growth in the second half of the year, partly because of the anticipated pick-up in farm output following the breaking of the drought. ", " Household consumption growth remains solid, despite easing from the rapid pace seen in 2002. In the March quarter, consumption grew by 1 per cent, to be 3.5 per cent higher than a year earlier. Growth in expenditure on goods picked up sharply in the quarter, while expenditure on services increased more modestly. Over the year, both components increased at the same rate. ", " Recent indicators suggest continued solid growth in consumer spending. The volume of retail sales, which accounts for more than a third of household consumption, increased by 1.9 per cent in the June quarter, to be 3.6 per cent higher over the year (Graph 21). This was noticeably stronger than the 0.1 per cent increase recorded in the March quarter. The pick-up occurred in all major components, but was particularly marked in sales by department stores and household goods retailers, consistent with a continuing strong housing sector. Sales of passenger motor vehicles also increased strongly during the first half of this year, to be 12 per cent higher in June than a year ago, partly due to the high level of affordability of vehicles and the popularity of new models released in late 2002. ", " The factors underpinning the near-term outlook for consumption growth remain quite favourable. Growth in wage incomes remains firm, and consumer sentiment has risen strongly in recent months, partly because of the end of the war in Iraq. The cumulative increases in wealth associated with rising housing prices in recent years are also likely to continue to support consumption in the period ahead. ", " Real household disposable income has been relatively subdued, increasing by 1.1 per cent over the year to the March quarter, compared with average annual growth of around 3 per cent over the previous two years. In the March quarter, strong employment growth and higher wages were partly offset by lower farm incomes. With consumption growing more quickly than disposable income, there has been a significant fall in the household saving ratio. Some of this fall should be temporary, since the expected recovery in farm incomes is likely to boost income growth in the near term. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘Credit Growth’, households have continued to borrow at a rapid pace. Household credit increased at an annualised rate of around 23 per cent over the June quarter, with lending for investment housing expanding at an even more rapid annualised rate of 34 per cent over the quarter. Over the past year, the strong pace of debt accumulation has outstripped the growth in the household sector's assets, despite further significant gains in housing wealth (Table 9). As a result, household gearing – the ratio of debt to assets – increased to around 15 per cent in the March quarter. ", " Reflecting the rapid pace of credit growth and the increases in variable lending rates in mid 2002, households' gross interest payments are estimated to have increased strongly over the past year. The debt-servicing ratio reached 7.6 per cent of household disposable income in the March quarter (Graph 22). While this ratio is below the peak in the late 1980s, it is around the same level as the peaks of the interest-rate cycles in <span class=\"no-wrap\">1995–1996 and 2000</span>, despite the lower level of interest rates currently prevailing. ", " The housing construction cycle appears to have reached a peak around the end of 2002. Following two years of solid growth, dwelling investment fell slightly in the March quarter, though it was still 18 per cent higher than a year earlier. Leading indicators of housing construction activity point to further easing in new dwelling investment. However, there is a large amount of work in the pipeline in the medium-density sector, as well as significant renovation activity and signs of strength in leading indicators of housing demand and finance. Consequently, the downturn in dwelling investment is likely to be quite mild relative to that seen in previous cycles, and somewhat smaller than expected at the start of this year. ", " The number of building approvals for detached houses has increased strongly over the past couple of months, to be around the peak reached in the second half of 2002 (Graph 23). In line with this renewed strength, builders are reporting an increase in commitments to construct new houses. In contrast, approvals in the medium-density sector, where investor activity has been concentrated in recent years, have been on a downward trend since reaching a peak last October. Approvals for dwellings in buildings of four or more storeys have been particularly weak. Anecdotal evidence suggests that investor interest in new apartments has been waning for some time, and some apartment developers report difficulties in meeting required pre-sales and face escalating construction costs, particularly in Melbourne. As a result, a number of projects have recently been deferred or cancelled. Despite this, activity and work yet to be done remain at high levels, particularly on large inner-city apartment projects. ", " Expenditure on alterations and additions has grown strongly, in part because of rising house prices. Despite a fall in the three months to May, loan approvals for alterations and additions have risen rapidly over the past year, and the value of building approvals for this purpose rose by 8.8 per cent in June. ", " Indicators of financing activity in the housing market more broadly remain buoyant. The value of loan approvals to both owner-occupiers and investors has picked up since the beginning of the year (Graph 24), along with refinancing activity. The value of total new housing loan approvals in May was around 19 per cent higher than a year earlier. Reflecting this high level of loan approvals, credit extended for housing continues to grow rapidly, expanding at an annual rate of nearly 24 per cent over the June quarter. Given the lags between loan approvals and the increase in credit outstanding, the strong pace of credit growth can be expected to continue, at least in the near term. ", " According to most sources, overall measures of dwelling prices increased substantially in the March quarter. Data from the Commonwealth Bank suggest the pace of growth was maintained in the June quarter, with established house prices rising by 10 per cent, to be 26 per cent higher over the year. In contrast, preliminary June quarter data from Residex on repeat sales, which attempt to abstract from compositional changes in the stock of dwellings being sold, are suggestive of a slowdown in the pace of price growth in Sydney and Melbourne. However, these data can be subject to significant revision. Overall measures of prices of medium-density dwellings have also recorded solid gains over the year to the June quarter, although rents have been subdued. Experience has varied significantly across cities and in different parts of cities, with prices rising more quickly in Sydney than in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Melbourne (Graph 25)</span>. ", " In the inner Melbourne apartment market, prices have been flat for some time and falling in some areas, and rents have been under downward pressure, partly in response to the rapid increase in the supply of new apartments. To date, however, there is little evidence that weakness in this part of the market is having a significant flow-on effect on the broader market for apartments in Melbourne. ", " The strong increases in housing prices over recent years have reduced measures of housing affordability. This appears to have contributed to a decline in the participation of first-home buyers in the market, with their share of new loan approvals for owner-occupation declining over the past two years to be slightly below 20 per cent in May. ", " The growth of the economy over the past year has been characterised by sharply contrasting performances in the farm and non-farm sectors and, within the non-farm sector, between goods and services industries. Much of the overall growth in the non-farm economy has been accounted for by the goods sector (Graph 26), largely because of continued strength in the construction industry. Conditions in the business services sector have been more subdued, as firms have continued to rein in discretionary spending, especially the subsidiaries of global firms facing weak conditions overseas. ", " Reports from most business surveys indicate that conditions generally remain close to – or better than – average, though there are some significant variations across industries (Graph 27). The NAB survey for the non-farm economy reported that current and expected conditions remained above average in the June quarter, though not as strong as at the end of 2002. Buoyant conditions in domestically oriented industries, particularly construction, offset weaker conditions faced by export-oriented firms, including some parts of manufacturing. The June quarter ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers similarly reported actual and expected output at above-average levels. In recent months, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey, which covers the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors, has reported a significant lift in actual and expected business conditions, back to long-run average levels, after reporting more pessimistic readings than most other major surveys in 2002. ", " In line with the strength in the domestic non-farm economy, businesses in aggregate have recorded high levels of profitability in recent quarters. Profits of the private corporate sector, as measured by gross operating surplus, increased by 2.2 per cent in the March quarter, to be 9½ per cent higher over the year and a relatively high share of GDP (Graph 28). Profits of non-farm unincorporated businesses fell slightly in the March quarter, but growth over the year remained robust at almost 9 per cent. This is consistent with strong construction and retail activity, where unincorporated businesses have a relatively large presence. With growth in the non-farm economy easing, however, some moderation in profit performance may now be in prospect. According to the NAB survey, businesses' expected levels of profitability have eased in the past couple of quarters, but remain well above their long-run average. ", " Strong profit growth has meant that firms have been able to rely relatively heavily on internal funds to finance investment (Graph 29). As a result, business borrowing from intermediaries has been soft for much of the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span>, increasing by around 5 per cent on an annualised basis over this period. Larger firms have, however, maintained a fairly solid pace of non-intermediated debt raisings, mainly through offshore bond issuance. Equity raisings by non-financial firms strengthened in the June quarter, but remain fairly low. ", " Business investment still appears to be in a solid upswing, underpinned by accommodative financial conditions and a relatively high level of capacity utilisation. While overall investment declined slightly in the March quarter, this was entirely due to lower spending on civil aircraft, which had been exceptionally strong in the previous quarter. Over the past year, capital spending rose by more than 17 per cent, with the main categories of investment – machinery and equipment investment (abstracting from civil aircraft deliveries), buildings and structures, and spending on computer software – all recording robust growth in the quarter and over the year. ", " Indicators of investment intentions have proven quite resilient in the face of weakness in global economic conditions. They continue to point to further growth in investment, though at a slower pace than seen in the past year (Graph 30). The March quarter ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey suggests growth of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">6½ per cent</span> in nominal business investment spending in 2003/04, with this growth skewed towards the buildings and structures component. For expenditure on machinery and equipment, growth of around 2 per cent is expected in nominal terms. However, this is likely to translate into somewhat stronger growth in real terms given falls in equipment prices, in part due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar. ", " Other forward-looking indicators confirm the strong outlook for buildings and structures investment in the current financial year (Graph 31). Engineering construction has risen by 50 per cent over the past year, to reach very high levels, and is set to expand further in the near term, driven by a considerable stock of resource and infrastructure work in the pipeline. Non-residential building activity is also expected to remain strong in the period ahead, with work done currently running well behind approvals, which remained at around 13-year highs over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span>. The positive outlook for buildings and structures investment is supported by the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em>, with a sharp pick-up in the number of projects committed for construction pointing to renewed strength in project commencements in the period ahead. ", " Non-farm businesses engaged in heavy inventory accumulation in the March quarter, leading to a <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage point</span> contribution to quarterly GDP growth. Non-farm inventory-to-sales ratios nonetheless remain relatively low and the expected pick-up in agricultural production will generate some re-stocking in that sector. These factors point to a further build-up of inventories over 2003, but at a more moderate pace, implying a partial reversal of the significant contribution of inventories to March quarter growth. ", " The farm sector continued to subtract from growth in the March quarter, and the ABS projects a further decline in farm output, with output reaching a trough in the June quarter (Graph 26). The latest ABS projections, based on Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) estimates, indicate that farm GDP fell by around 30 per cent over the year to the June quarter 2003, subtracting a little under 1 percentage point from GDP growth, which is a slightly smaller subtraction than previously expected. While the improvement in weather conditions across the country in autumn was rather uneven, ABARE is expecting a significant rebound in farm production in 2003/04. However, it is expected to be more muted than that following the breaking of the 1982/83 drought, when rainfall was more favourably timed and placed. According to ABARE's current forecasts, farm production is not expected to reach the high levels prevailing in the years immediately preceding the onset of the drought. Continuing dry conditions in some cropping areas prevented or delayed the sowing of winter crops and are likely to result in lower yields than is typical of recoveries from drought. Even so, ABARE expects crop production to rise by over 40 per cent in 2003/04. At the same time, conditions for livestock and irrigated-crop farmers are expected to remain difficult, with shortages of stored water persisting in many areas. ", " The 2003/04 Commonwealth Budget, presented in May, announced a small reduction in the expected surplus in both underlying cash and accrual terms. New policy decisions announced in the Budget included personal income tax cuts, increased spending on defence and domestic security, and reform of higher education and Medicare. Using the change in the underlying cash balance between financial years as an approximate indicator of the fiscal impact, the Commonwealth Budget is expected to add to growth by around ¼ per cent of GDP this financial year, compared with a contractionary effect of around ¾ per cent in 2002/03 (Graph 32). On a similar basis, state budgets are expected to have a combined expansionary impact of around ¼ per cent of GDP in the current financial year. ", " Over the past year, employment growth has been around trend, though lower in recent months. In the three months to July, the average level of recorded employment was 2.1 per cent higher than a year earlier, but lower than the average level in the previous three months (Graph 33). To some extent, recent trends in employment growth have been made more difficult to interpret by volatility resulting from changes to the Labour Force Survey. Notwithstanding this, and consistent with trend growth in employment, the unemployment rate has been largely unchanged over the past year, averaging 6.1 per cent in the three months to July. At this level, the unemployment rate is close to the cyclical lows reached during the past two decades. The participation rate has returned to around 63¾ per cent in recent months, following the bedding down of the changes to the Labour Force Survey. ", " Recent job vacancy and hiring intentions data have been providing divergent signals about the prospects for the labour market. Business surveys report that hiring intentions for the September quarter remain well above historical average levels (Graph 34). The ABS employer-based measure of job vacancies also appears consistent with firm labour demand. While the reported number of vacancies declined in the June quarter, the series has trended upwards for some time and in the June quarter was still more than 10 per cent higher than a year earlier. In contrast, the ANZ print-based vacancy measure has declined over the past year. On balance, these indicators appear consistent with relatively good employment outcomes, though employment growth in the near term appears likely to be lower than the pace recorded over the past 12 months. ", " Over the past year, South Australia and Queensland have had the strongest labour markets, with employment growth well above trend, and relatively large falls in their unemployment rates (Table 10). In contrast, employment growth has been weaker in New South Wales and Victoria, with the unemployment rates in these two states broadly unchanged over the year. ", " On an industry basis, growth in employment in the retail trade sector made the largest contribution to aggregate growth over the year to the June quarter (Table 11). The ongoing strength of employment outcomes for this industry is consistent with robust growth in retail sales. Large contributions to employment growth over the past year were also made by the public sector and the property and business services industry, which has benefited from robust sales activity in housing markets. Employment in the manufacturing and construction industries fell in the June quarter, following strong employment growth over the previous year. With the effect of the drought beginning to recede, there has been a marked turnaround in agricultural employment, but the level of employment in this industry remains well down on levels of a year ago in most regions. ", " Slow world growth and the effects of drought have weighed on exports recently, while strong domestic growth has underpinned demand for imports. As a result, Australia has recorded a substantial increase in its deficit on trade in goods and services over the past year and a half, with the deficit standing at around 3½ per cent of GDP in the June quarter, compared with around ½ per cent in late 2001 (Graph 35). The current account deficit is expected to have widened to around 6½ per cent of GDP in the June quarter (assuming that the net income deficit remains constant as a proportion of GDP). ", " Export values fell significantly in the June quarter to be down by nearly 10 per cent over the year. An important driver of this has been the fall in export prices, partly due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar, which on a trade-weighted basis averaged 8½ per cent higher than in the June quarter a year ago (see ‘<a href=\"#cp\">Commodity Prices</a>’ for a more detailed discussion of export prices). Data on export volumes are not yet available for the June quarter; however, with the exception of rural exports, volumes have been relatively flat over the past couple of years, after strong average growth through the 1990s (Graphs 36 and 37). ", " The fall in the value of exports has been broadly based, with declines in most classes of goods and services, and to most markets. The fall in rural exports has been especially sharp, with the value of exports in the June quarter down by over 27 per cent on the level of a year ago, largely reflecting the effect of the drought. In the June quarter, the weakness was compounded by lower wool exports, due to temporarily low demand from Chinese buyers owing to the SARS outbreak. The value of beef and veal exports also fell sharply in the quarter in response to weaker demand from the US. Looking ahead, a strong recovery in rural exports is expected in 2003/04, in line with the predicted rebound in agricultural production that will stem from harvesting the current winter crop. The increase in rural exports may, however, be somewhat smaller than that following the breaking of previous droughts, given downward revisions to the estimated size of the 2003/04 crop. The recovery in other classes of rural produce will be more muted as a result of their less favourable production prospects in the near term. ", " The value of resource exports also fell in the June quarter, to be around 9 per cent lower than a year ago. This follows several quarters in which resource exports were relatively flat. A key influence has been the subdued growth in the world economy, which has resulted in weak demand for many commodities, particularly metals. In addition, there have been declines in the world prices of some commodities and lower Australian dollar receipts, particularly in the June quarter. The value of manufactured exports fell by 2 per cent over the year to the June quarter, compared with average annual growth of around 15 per cent for much of the 1990s. ", " There was a marked fall in the value of Australian service exports in the June quarter, in line with the world-wide downturn in international travel associated with the Iraq war and the spread of SARS (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a> on ‘SARs’). Service exports were around 7 per cent lower than a year earlier. Early in the quarter, the number of overseas arrivals fell particularly sharply, to approach levels seen in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, driven largely by falling arrivals from Japan and SARS-affected countries in east Asia (Graph 38). Reflecting this, there has been weak demand for a range of tourism services consumed by international visitors. However, with the number of SARS cases having stabilised, overseas arrivals began to recover in June, with the increase in arrivals sourced largely from east Asia. Airport bodies report that this continued in July. While part of the recent increase reflects the carry-over of travel that had been planned for the period affected by SARS, forward bookings are also increasing and suggest the recovery may consolidate. ", " The value of imports increased over the year to the June quarter by around 3 per cent. With import prices lower in Australian-dollar terms, this implies that the volume of imports has increased solidly, in line with robust growth in domestic demand (Graph 39). A strong rise in the value of merchandise imports over the year offset a fall in services imports. Imports of consumption goods continue to grow rapidly, with imports of motor vehicles the main contributor to the strength, while capital imports remain volatile, owing to the periodic importation of civil aircraft. ", " The net income deficit narrowed significantly in the March quarter to stand at a near-decade low of 2.8 per cent of GDP. While lower global interest rates have helped contain debt-servicing costs, the past year or so has seen a significant increase in net dividend payments. This partly reflects relatively solid profit growth in Australia. ", " Australia's net foreign debt rose slightly in the March quarter, but remained around 48½ per cent of GDP. Net foreign equity liabilities also increased in the quarter, as the appreciation of the Australian dollar lowered the Australian-dollar value of foreign equity assets (Graph 40). The trend over the past few years of strong net debt inflows and moderate net equity outflows continued in the quarter. Overall, total net foreign liabilities rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.7 per cent</span>, to around 57½ per cent of GDP. ", " In SDR terms, rural commodity prices have fallen markedly since mid last year, to be at their lowest level in three years. Other commodity prices, while displaying some volatility, are only slightly lower than their levels of a year ago. In aggregate, commodity prices in the three months to July were 4.5 per cent lower than a year <span class=\"no-wrap\">ago (Graph 41)</span>. Despite this fall, the aggregate commodity price index is only slightly below the average of the past 10 years in SDR terms. The fall in commodity prices in Australian-dollar terms has, however, been much larger, reflecting the appreciation of the Australian dollar. ", " The weakness in rural commodity prices has been broadly based. In SDR terms, sugar prices fell by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 per cent</span> in the three months to July, to be nearly 12 per cent lower than a year ago, largely as a result of increased world production. Beef prices have also fallen since mid 2002, as drought in North America and Australia has induced higher slaughter rates. Wheat prices remain weak and in the three months to July were around <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> lower than the same period a year ago, though they spiked in late 2002 as a result of drought. In contrast, base metals prices have ebbed and flowed with changes in sentiment about the global economy, but have edged up in the past three months. Some other resource prices have also edged higher with, for example, the US dollar contract prices for iron ore for the Japanese fiscal year 2003/04 (beginning 1 April 2003) rising by around 9 per cent on levels of the previous year. The gold price remained roughly flat in the three months to July, though traded in a broad band. ", " Import prices have also declined recently, falling by around 6¼ per cent over the year to the June quarter in Australian-dollar terms; in SDR terms, they are around ½ per cent lower than a year ago. This weakness in world prices reflects low prices for a range of manufactured goods, combined with a trend of falling relative prices of information and communications technology goods, which account for a growing share of imports. In <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian-dollar</span> terms, falls in import prices have been proportionately greater than those for exports, so that there has been a rise in the terms of trade over the year (Graph 42). However, recent price data suggest the terms of trade are likely to have fallen slightly in the June quarter. ", " In contrast to weakness in most commodity prices, oil prices remain relatively high and volatile. Having peaked ahead of the Iraq war and fallen sharply following its commencement, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has since risen again, amidst uncertainty about the resumption and continuity of Iraqi export supply. At present, oil production in Iraq is still well below its pre-war level, though there are expectations that this will increase to around three-quarters of the pre-war level by the end of the year. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has averaged around US$30 per barrel in the past three months and is currently just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$32 per barrel (Graph 43)</span>. ", " The cycle in overseas markets over the past three months, as described in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International  and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, has been reflected in domestic markets. From early May to mid June, domestic bond yields followed global yields lower on concerns about potential deflationary pressures in the US and related expectations of easier monetary policy abroad and in Australia. Over these six weeks, Australian 10-year yields fell by 70 basis points, to a 40-year low of 4.59 per cent (Graph 44). ", " The decline in bond yields was more than unwound over the second half of June and July, again reflecting US market developments. By early August, the yield on 10-year bonds was 5.5 per cent, some 25 basis points above its level in early May. ", " Yields on inflation-indexed bonds have moved in a similar way to nominal yields since the last <em>Statement</em>. After touching a low of 2.7 per cent in June, yields on 10-year indexed bonds now stand at around 3.3 per cent, <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 basis points</span> higher than their level in early May. ", " While movements in yields on Australian government bonds have generally followed those in the US market, the spread between the two widened in early June when US yields fell particularly sharply (Graph 45). At one point, the spread reached 160 basis points. As US bond yields subsequently rose over the following weeks, the spread retraced, narrowing to around 110 basis points by early August. At this level, it remains around the average of the past couple of years. ", " Throughout the three months, the target cash rate has remained unchanged at 4.75 per cent. Expectations of monetary easing in the second half of the year increased in May and into early June, due to concerns about continued global weakness and upward pressure on the exchange rate. At one point, markets had priced in a cash rate of 4.0 per cent by year-end. Since then, improved sentiment about global prospects, the decline in the exchange rate and rising concerns about the rapid growth of housing credit have seen these expectations scaled back markedly. Consistent with these developments, yields on 90-day and 180-day bank bills have risen back to levels around the cash rate (Graph 46). ", " The relative movements of short and long rates have seen the shape of the yield curve change noticeably over the past three months (Graph 47). A pronounced negative slope for maturities out to three years emerged during May and June. In fact, at one stage, even 10-year yields were below the overnight cash rate, the first inversion of the curve in two and a half years. The subsequent improvement in market sentiment has restored the yield curve to a shape similar to that in early May; this has long yields above the cash rates, though yields on 2-year bonds remain around the cash rate. ", " Abstracting from changes in the composition of corporate bond indices, spreads between yields on government and corporate bonds have shown a small net decline over the past three months (Graph 48).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Despite brief increases in the first half of June and early August, spreads are now 10 to 20 basis points below the peaks seen in October–November 2002. Comparable measures of credit risk derived from credit default swaps have declined by even more (see ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2003/jul/2.html\">New  Measures of Credit Risk</a>’, Reserve Bank <cite>Bulletin</cite>, July 2003, for a discussion of these measures). The narrowing of spreads indicates growing optimism regarding corporate creditworthiness. In addition, investors have shown a greater willingness to invest in riskier bonds as they seek out relatively high-yielding investments in the low-yield environment. ", " The rise in government bond yields has, however, more than offset the decline in corporate spreads. As a result, yields on corporate bonds are about 30 basis points higher than at end April. ", " Variable indicator rates have remained unchanged since June 2002, reflecting the unchanged cash rate <span class=\"no-wrap\">target (Table 12)</span>. From around that time, fixed lending rates for both businesses and housing declined steadily; in June 2003, 3-year fixed business rates reached their lowest level since comparable data were first collected in September 1994. Since then, fixed business rates have increased, though by less than the rise in the cost of funding these loans. Banks' 3-year fixed housing rates have also moved slightly higher since June, but remain nearly 100 basis points lower than in mid 2002. Three-year fixed housing rates are now 60 basis points below the standard variable rate (Graph 49). Nevertheless, and despite increasing marginally in June, the share of fixed-rate housing loan approvals in total approvals remains low by historical standards. ", " Continuing the rebound in share prices which started in March, the Australian share market has risen another <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> in the past three months; the ASX 200 is up 16 per cent since mid March (Graph 50). While the Australian market has not kept pace with the rises seen in the US over recent months, over the longer term it has been considerably more stable; the ASX 200 is now around the same level as at the end of 1999, whereas the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by about one-third over that period. ", " The rise in share prices has been broadly based with all sectors apart from the consumer staples and utilities sectors rising over the three months. The materials, energy and telecommunications sectors have outperformed. The strength in the materials and energy sectors reflects a perceived improvement in prospects for export markets in the year ahead and speculation regarding mergers and acquisitions, while the rise in the telecommunications sector is due to a re-rating of Telstra. Within the financial sector, prices for the insurance industry continued to fall, due in large part to the sharp fall in AMP's share price in early June following the announcement of a de-merger of its UK and Australian operations. The insurance sector index has fallen by more than 20 per cent since the start of the year. ", " Following the end of formal hostilities in Iraq in April, the options market's assessment of likely share market volatility fell noticeably. In particular, the market has scaled back its view of downside risk, with the expected likelihood of a fall of 15 per cent or more over the next three months dropping from 8 per cent to 3 per cent. ", " The rise in share prices has come despite a marked increase in the number of profit warnings issued by Australian listed companies. Many of the considerations underlying these profit warnings had already been factored into share market valuations. The increase in profit warnings, from 77 in the six months to December 2002 to 117 in the six months to June 2003, is more than can be explained by the usual seasonality in profit warnings (Graph 51). The tourism/leisure and manufacturing/food industries saw the largest increases in the number of warnings, reflecting the outbreak of SARS in Asia, the Iraq war and weak global economy. Around a dozen warnings (mostly in the materials, industrials and consumer sectors) cited the appreciation of the Australian dollar as a contributing factor. The profit warnings have resulted in analysts' estimates of profits for the 2002/03 year being scaled back. The one-year-ahead forecast had also been scaled back but, at around 11 per cent, is similar to what it has been in the past (Graph 52). ", " The Australian price-earnings (P/E) ratio dropped in May to around 20 (Graph 53). This measure is based on trailing earnings over the prior year and the May fall largely reflects the ‘dropping out’ of the large losses recorded by News Corporation a year ago. The ratio is still a little above its long-run average. ", " The dividend yield on shares, at around 4 per cent, remains relatively attractive compared with the general level of interest rates. The dividend yield is in effect a real yield, so that the more direct comparison is with real interest rates. Through much of the 1990s, the dividend yield was below the real government bond yield, but recently it has moved noticeably above (Graph 54). ", " Bond issuance by Australian non-government issuers was again robust in the June quarter, driven by continued strong issuance into offshore markets (Table 13). Total bond issuance by these entities amounted to $33.8 billion in the June quarter, up slightly from the March quarter and well ahead of the quarterly rate in 2002. Financial institutions were the main issuers, accounting for over half the quarterly total, with the remainder fairly evenly spread between asset-backed vehicles and non-financial companies. ", " Domestic issuance by Australian entities was $7.3 billion, up a little on the previous quarter. A new record, of <span class=\"no-wrap\">$1.5 billion</span>, was set for issuance at a single maturity in the June quarter. Also, since late last year, two new types of bonds have appeared. The first is a property developer's issue of securitised debt backed by a revolving portfolio of off-the-plan apartment sales. The second is portfolio credit-linked notes. These are debt securities that package together a standard bond with a credit default swap. The interest rate paid on the credit-linked note reflects the creditworthiness of the company underlying the credit default swap. In the case of a portfolio <span class=\"no-wrap\">credit-linked</span> note, the rate reflects the combined creditworthiness of a portfolio of companies underlying the credit default swap rather than a single company. ", " At the end of June, the volume of outstanding non-government bonds in the domestic market was $131 billion, up from $127 billion in March (Graph 55). Commonwealth government bonds and state government bonds outstanding were little changed at $57 billion and $53 billion respectively. ", " Offshore issuance by Australian entities increased further in the June quarter, to $26.5 billion – that is, about four times as large as domestic issuance. The month of July, however, saw some slowing, in part because of a diversion to domestic issuance. ", " Most offshore issuance by Australian borrowers in the June quarter was denominated in foreign currencies <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 56)</span>, with US dollar debt continuing to account for the bulk of such issuance. However, a shift by financial intermediaries towards borrowing in euros and UK pounds, as they seek to diversify their funding sources, saw those currencies' share of offshore foreign currency issuance increase sharply to almost 30 per cent. Non-financial companies and asset-backed vehicles continued to predominantly borrow in US dollars. Even though these primary issues are mainly in foreign currencies, the bulk is subsequently swapped back to Australian dollars using derivatives markets. ", " As discussed in <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2003/may/1.html#box-d\">Box D</a> of the May 2003 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, spreads on cross-currency basis swaps fell sharply during 2002 making it more attractive for Australian borrowers to issue offshore (Graph 57). This fall in spreads was largely a result of the increase in Australian dollar issuance by non-Australian borrowers into the Japanese retail market (the uridashi market) which boosted demand to receive an Australian dollar interest rate under cross-currency swap agreements. Although these spreads have since risen from their lows, as foreign currency issuance by Australian corporates has picked up and the wave of uridashi issuance has peaked, they remained relatively attractive for Australian borrowers through the June quarter. That said, the recent pick-up in these premia is consistent with the easing in offshore issuance by Australian companies in the month of July. ", " Non-residents raised a total of $6.0 billion of Australian dollar securities during the June quarter, mostly in offshore markets. This was only about half the size of issues in the previous quarter, reflecting a considerable lessening of demand for Australian dollar paper by the Japanese retail market. ", " Domestic issuance of hybrid securities (that is, those securities that contain features of both debt and equity) has also been strong recently, with $0.8 billion issued in the June quarter, and a further $0.8 billion in July. Consistent with the pattern seen in 2001 and 2002, most issuance this year has been in the form of reset <span class=\"no-wrap\">securities (Graph 58).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup></span> ", " Total credit increased at an annual rate of 13.9 per cent over the six months to June, slightly faster than growth over the previous six-month period (Graph 59). The growth in total credit continues to mask divergent movements in its components, with credit to the household sector growing at an exceptionally strong pace, while borrowing by businesses has remained relatively subdued (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#credit-growth\">Credit Growth</a>’). The strong pace of household credit growth has been driven predominately by housing-related borrowing. However, personal borrowing for non-housing purposes has also been strong recently, increasing at an annualised rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">14.6 per cent</span> over the six months to June. The pick-up in growth has been concentrated in revolving finance and personal term loans, while growth in credit card lending slowed to an annual rate of 12¼ per cent in recent months, after running at an average annual rate of around 18 per cent over the past five years. As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic Activity</a>’, the subdued business borrowing largely reflects that businesses have been able to rely on strong profits to finance investment. ", " On the other side of intermediaries' balance sheets, growth in the broader monetary aggregates has remained fairly strong in recent months, to be running at an annualised rate of 11.8 per cent over the six months to June, slightly lower than growth in total credit (Graph 60). This strength has been partly driven by growth in wholesale deposits with banks. ", " Equity raisings were very strong in the June quarter with net issuance totalling $7 billion, the highest quarterly total on record (excluding privatisations; Graph 61). Issuance was dominated by two large raisings: Promina's <span class=\"no-wrap\">$1.9 billion</span> new listing and AMP's institutional placement of $1.2 billion (AMP raised an additional $500 million in July). In addition to these issues, other equity raisings were quite strong, with a number of private placements by property trusts and solid raisings through dividend reinvestment plans. ", " Credit has grown at an average rate of 11 per cent per annum since 1995 and 13 per cent over the past year. In comparison, growth in nominal GDP has averaged 6 per cent since 1995. The result of this extended period of rapid credit growth has been a strong upward trend in the ratio of credit to GDP (Graph 62). ", " Unlike the period of rapid credit expansion in the late 1980s, the current episode has been characterised by a strong increase in credit extended to the household sector, rather than to the business sector. Household credit has grown at an average annual rate of 14 per cent since the mid 1990s, and by almost 20 per cent over the past year. The result has been a doubling in the ratio of household credit to GDP since 1995. In contrast, business credit has recorded average annual growth of 7½ per cent since the mid 1990s and, as a share of GDP, has changed little in net terms since 1987. ", " The pace of credit growth in Australia has been unusually fast by international standards (Table 14). Of the major industrialised economies only the Netherlands and Spain have recorded broadly similar growth to that in Australia since 1995.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 3\">[3]</a></sup> In other countries, it has not been uncommon for credit growth to average between 6 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> per year over this period. If anything, the divergence between developments in Australia and elsewhere has become more pronounced over the past couple of years, with most countries experiencing a decline in the pace of overall credit expansion in line with the slowdown in economic growth. ", " The available international data indicate that in most countries growth in household credit has generally been around the same pace as that in total credit since the mid 1990s. Over the past year or so, however, household credit growth has generally picked up, partly in response to low interest rates and strong housing markets. Despite this, the scale of the divergence between household and total credit growth in Australia is unusual by international standards. Another unusual aspect of the Australian experience is the high proportion of total household credit growth accounted for by investors, with, for example, investors accounting for around <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> of the value of all new housing loan approvals over recent months. ", " There are a number of factors that help explain the persistently strong household credit growth in Australia. Innovation in the provision of mortgage finance and expectations of relatively attractive after-tax returns on residential property have played a role, as have cyclically low interest rates over recent years. A more important influence though is the continuing adjustment by the household sector to the structural decline in nominal lending rates since the 1980s. Importantly, this decline has allowed households to borrow roughly twice as much relative to income as was possible in the late 1980s, while maintaining a given debt-servicing ratio. In addition, greater stability in both interest rates and the economy has encouraged some households to increase their level of gearing. These changes have resulted in a significant upward shift in the ratio of household debt to GDP, and thus a period of above-average credit growth. However, at some point this transitional process must come to an end, which would require household credit growth to return to something more closely in line with the growth of nominal GDP. ", " There is no firm benchmark as to what constitutes a ‘normal’ relationship between credit growth and nominal GDP growth. A stable ratio of credit to GDP would require that they both grow at the same rate, but international evidence suggests that it is not unusual for credit to grow, on average, a little faster than nominal GDP. History and international comparisons provide some guide as to what might be seen as ‘normal’ in this context. While this guide is only approximate, the current pace of household credit growth in Australia exceeds any reasonable benchmark by a large margin. ", " In interpreting past experience, one needs to take into account that, over recent decades, financial systems in most countries have been liberalised. As constraints on the availability of credit were removed in the 1980s, there was a ‘catch-up’ effect as firms and households increased their borrowings. In addition, and partly as a result of financial liberalisation, the 1980s saw an unsustainable boom in business credit associated with rapid increases in asset prices, particularly commercial property. The result in a number of countries, including Australia, was average credit growth over the late 1980s almost 10 percentage points faster than the growth in nominal <span class=\"no-wrap\">GDP (Graph 63)</span>. ", " Ultimately, the credit and asset price boom of the 1980s led to financial difficulties in a range of countries. In Finland, Norway, Sweden and Japan, the outcome was a full-scale banking crisis, while in the United Kingdom and Australia financial institutions experienced significant losses. In the years immediately following these problems, credit outstanding grew more slowly than nominal GDP and, in a number of countries, fell in absolute terms as businesses and financial institutions sought to correct the excessive debt positions built up during the 1980s. It was not until the mid 1990s that the pace of credit growth again generally exceeded that in nominal GDP, although in Japan credit outstanding has continued to fall. ", " This turbulent history makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about ‘normal’ relationships. One country that may provide a guide is Canada, which has a long history of a relatively deregulated financial system and was not greatly affected by the financial excesses of the late 1980s. There, credit has grown on average by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ percentage points</span> faster than nominal GDP since 1980. ", " In Australia, the unusually rapid credit growth at present is confined to the household sector. At around <span class=\"no-wrap\">14 percentage points</span> above nominal GDP growth, household credit growth is clearly faster than is sustainable in the medium term. As a basis for comparison, between 1980 and 1995, household credit grew, on average, by around 3¾ percentage points faster than nominal GDP. Had this differential been maintained since 1995, the level of household credit outstanding would have been almost one-third lower than is currently the case (Graph 64). ", " While a continuation of the rapid pace of credit growth into the indefinite future is not sustainable, it remains unclear how the current episode of rapid credit expansion will be drawn to a close. Historically, credit booms have tended to end only after a protracted period of higher-than-average interest rates and/or a significant contraction in the economy. Neither of these events looks likely in the immediate future. While there is evidence of weakness in rents, there are, as yet, few signs that this is flowing through to house prices or to loan applications. ", " As discussed above, in the past when credit and asset price booms have ended, they have often resulted in financial and economic instability, with banks suffering losses and the business and household sectors cutting back spending as they repair their balance sheets. Notwithstanding this historical experience, as far as can be judged, recent developments in Australia do not pose a significant direct risk to the financial system. They do, however, make household consumption more sensitive to changes in economic conditions than in the past. Moreover, the longer the rapid increase in household borrowing continues, the greater is the risk that, at some point, households will need to adjust the structure of their balance sheets with potentially adverse consequences for the economy and financial institutions. ", " As has been the case for some time now, financial conditions are generally supportive of continuing growth in the domestic economy. ", " The target cash rate has been unchanged at 4.75 per cent since June 2002, and similarly, most variable lending rates have remained unchanged over this period. Measured in real terms, variable loan rates are as much as <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage point</span> below their average level over the past five years, and up to 2¼ percentage points below their average since the early 1990s (Graph 65). The low level of interest rates, relative to historical benchmarks, suggests that the setting of monetary policy is accommodative. ", " This assessment is supported by the continuing rapid growth in household credit (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#credit-growth\">Credit Growth</a>’). Over the past year, household credit has increased by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span>, and with the value of housing loan approvals continuing to rise over recent months, there seems little prospect for a near-term slowing in the pace of growth. Borrowing for housing has been the main driver behind the expansion of debt, with borrowing by investors rising by 29 per cent over the past year, continuing to outpace borrowing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">owner-occupiers</span>, which increased by 18 per cent. While some financial institutions have reportedly tightened their credit standards for loans to investors in inner-city apartments, finance remains readily available on attractive terms. ", " In the business sector, few firms report interest rates or access to finance as being significant constraints on investment activity. Further, corporate bond spreads have fallen recently to relatively low levels, suggesting that access to external finance is not being constrained by concerns over credit quality. Share prices have also risen over recent months on the back of a general improvement in market sentiment, with the ASX 200 returning to around its level of a year ago. While growth in borrowing by businesses has been relatively subdued over the past year, this primarily reflects the ready availability of internal funding that has resulted from solid profit growth. ", " Long-term bond yields have been quite volatile since the previous <em>Statement</em>, and in net terms are up slightly, although they remain around ½ a percentage point lower than in mid 2002. Fixed-term lending rates on housing and business loans have fallen over the past year. In response, there has been only a slight increase in the share of loans with fixed rates recently, suggesting that borrowers see little prospect of an increase in interest rates in the foreseeable future. ", " The fall in bond yields over the past year, combined with an unchanged target cash rate, has seen a flattening of the yield curve. In early August, yields on 10-year bonds were around 75 basis points above the cash rate, slightly less than the average differential since the mid 1990s (Graph 66). One interpretation of this is that monetary conditions are not as accommodative as is suggested by the level of real short-term interest rates. An alternative, and perhaps more likely, interpretation is that the market expects that the target cash rate will remain below its average over recent years for some time, and this expectation is reflected in bond yields. ", " Another element of domestic financial conditions is the exchange rate, which has appreciated, in trade-weighted terms, by around 18 per cent over the past year, reducing the stimulus provided to the traded goods sector. This appreciation has occurred at a time when the terms of trade is above its average level of the past two decades and has been on an upward trend over recent years. While significant, the appreciation follows a period in which both real and nominal exchange rates were considerably below their average values over the post-float <span class=\"no-wrap\">period (Graph 67)</span>. At its current level, the real trade-weighted index is around 3 per cent above its average over this period. Against both the US dollar and the euro, however, the value of the Australian dollar, in real terms, remains below its post-float average. In contrast, the real exchange rate against the currencies of non-Japan Asia is around 12 per cent above its average value, reflecting the depreciation of these currencies at the time of the Asian crisis, and more recently, their close link to the weakening US dollar. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was flat in the June quarter, and increased by 2.7 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Table 15, Graph 68)</span>. Measures of underlying inflation increased by ½ per cent in the June quarter and, with the exception of the <em>market goods and services excluding volatile items</em> measure, increased by between <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ and 3 per cent</span> in year-ended terms (Graph 69). Overall, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is running at around 2¾ per cent, in year-ended terms. ", " The main positive contributions to CPI inflation in the June quarter and over the year came from increases in the housing and health components. House purchase costs increased by 2 per cent in the June quarter and by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5¼ per cent</span> over the year, as ongoing strength in the construction sector resulted in rising costs of materials and labour. The cost of health services also increased strongly in the quarter, to be up by almost 9 per cent over the year, partly due to higher insurance costs for both consumers and service providers. The exclusion of health services, as well as a number of other services provided by the public sector, largely explains the relatively modest increase in the <em>market goods and services excluding volatile items</em> measure of underlying inflation over the past year. This measure has typically been more volatile than other underlying measures, for example showing a higher peak in inflation (adjusted for the effects of tax changes) in 2001. ", " Overall, food prices were flat in the June quarter as sharp falls in fruit and vegetable prices were balanced by price rises for most other items. Over the year, food prices rose by 4½ per cent, with above-average price rises being recorded for a number of commodities affected by the drought. ", " As anticipated, the recent moderation of world oil prices resulted in a fall in fuel prices of almost 10 per cent in the June quarter. This fall reversed an earlier rise, so that movements in fuel prices have had little effect on the year-ended CPI inflation rate. Domestic holiday travel and accommodation prices also fell significantly in the quarter, partly due to seasonal factors, and increased only moderately over the year. ", " The downward trend in the prices of audio, visual and computing equipment continued in June, due to falling world prices for these goods and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. Prices of these goods have declined by 17½ per cent over the year. The effects of the exchange rate are also apparent in the significant fall in prices for imported motor vehicles in the June quarter, and in the further moderation of tradable goods and services prices, which fell by almost 1 per cent in the quarter to be 1 per cent higher over the year. In contrast, the prices of non-tradable goods and services have increased by 1 per cent per quarter, on average, for the past year. ", " In general, producer price pressures eased significantly in the June quarter, largely because of the fall in prices of oil and related products, and the generalised downward pressure on the prices of imported goods resulting from the exchange rate appreciation (Table 16). Producer price inflation also moderated over the year, particularly at the earlier stages of production (Graph 70), even though the effect of movements in oil prices was fairly small over this period. ", " Growth in prices of domestically produced items eased in the quarter, but continued to be boosted by large increases in the prices of housing-related items such as construction and real estate services. In contrast, the appreciation of the exchange rate has led to widespread price falls for imported items at all stages of production. The falls have been particularly large for imported electronic equipment. ", " Indicators of upstream inflationary pressures from business surveys have also moderated. The NAB survey reported that growth in average purchase costs slowed to 0.3 per cent in the June quarter, more than unwinding the pick-up reported in March. Average purchase costs for the September quarter are expected to increase by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span>. Similarly, the ACCI-Westpac survey reported that a larger proportion of manufacturing firms experienced a fall in their costs per unit of output in the June quarter than in the previous quarter, while the proportion reporting cost increases remained fairly steady. ", " Most labour cost indicators continued to signal solid wages growth in the March quarter. The wage cost index (WCI) for total pay increased by 0.9 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, to be 3.6 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 71). At the industry level, the education sector recorded the fastest annual growth in the WCI at 5.1 per cent, while the smallest increase was again recorded in the communications <span class=\"no-wrap\">sector (1.5 per cent)</span>. ", " Preliminary indications are that wages growth remained firm in the June quarter. The NAB survey measure of wages growth, while typically showing slower growth than other indicators, picked up a little in the June quarter. The survey also indicates that firms are continuing to find it difficult to attract suitable labour. This is consistent with a recent increase in the ACCI-Westpac survey measure, and suggests that labour market conditions remain relatively tight. The latest Mercer <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em> suggests that annual growth in executives' base salaries also picked up to 4.4 per cent in the June quarter from 4.0 per cent in March. ", " Average weekly ordinary-time earnings of full-time adults (AWOTE) grew by 1.3 per cent in the March quarter, to be 4.6 per cent higher over the year. The national accounts measures of compensation both grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span> in the March quarter, but these relatively low outcomes appear to have been affected by the recent changes to the Labour Force Survey. Over the year, compensation per employee increased by 2.8 per cent and compensation per hour worked increased by 3.0 per cent. Unit labour costs (based on compensation per hour worked) increased by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter, to be 2.4 per cent higher over the year. ", " Most indicators point to subdued expectations for inflation in the period ahead. The latest Melbourne Institute survey suggests that consumers now expect lower inflation over the next year than was the case in the early part of this year (Graph 72). In line with this moderation in expectations, the NAB survey reports that firms expect near-term price rises for both retail and all final products to be smaller than the rises they expected over the past few years. In the September quarter, retail prices are expected to increase by 0.2 per cent, while final product prices overall are expected to rise by 0.3 per cent. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of investors have been similarly subdued; the difference between 10-year bond yields and indexed bonds continues to fluctuate within the 2–2½ per cent range it has remained in since mid last year. Over the past three months, the financial market economists surveyed by the Bank have made no substantial revisions to their near-term forecasts for inflation, with the median CPI inflation forecast for the year to June 2004 remaining unchanged at 2.3 per cent (Table 17). In contrast, trade union officials surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT) have revised down their forecasts for inflation by around ½ of a percentage point over the next year and now expect inflation of around 3 per cent over the next two years. ", " As indicated above, the Bank's assessment is that the underlying rate of inflation in the year to the June quarter was around 2¾ per cent, the same as in the year to the March quarter. At the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> the Bank judged that underlying inflation was likely to fall slightly to around 2½ per cent in the second <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of 2003</span>, and to remain around that rate over the following year. Since that time, while domestic sources of inflation pressure have evolved broadly as expected, there has been a further net appreciation of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar</span>. Largely as a result, year-ended underlying inflation now appears likely to decline to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> in the first half of 2004. Assuming no further change in the exchange rate, it would be expected to remain around that level during the second half of the year before edging up slightly in mid 2005 as the effects of the appreciation on prices begin to dissipate. ", " Given this path for underlying inflation, CPI inflation is expected to dip temporarily below 2 per cent in early 2004 as the large March 2003 CPI figure drops out of the year-ended calculation. Furthermore, the standard assumption that international oil prices will fall to the middle of the OPEC target band by mid next year also contributes to expected CPI inflation being lower than underlying inflation through much of 2004. As these effects abate in the first half of 2005, CPI and underlying inflation are expected to be more closely aligned. ", " Underpinning these inflation forecasts is an expectation of a continuation of wages growth around current rates. Over the past year, the rate of increase in wages has picked up moderately, consistent with a strong labour market. But a sustained further increase in wages growth is not anticipated with the economy expected to grow below trend in 2003. Overall, unit labour costs are expected to increase at an average rate of between <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ and 3 per cent</span> over the next couple of years. ", " Indicators of upstream price pressures, such as producer price data and business surveys, continue to suggest moderate rates of inflation. World prices of traded goods have been broadly unchanged recently. Moreover, the appreciation of the Australian dollar has led to declines in the prices of a number of intermediate goods, and there are some signs that it is already flowing through into consumer prices for imported goods. In contrast, domestic price pressures are evident in a number of areas. In particular, ongoing strength in the construction sector has led to significant increases in the cost of building materials and in house purchase costs. Rising insurance costs have also contributed to price increases, in particular for health services. ", " As has been the case for some time, the global economy remains a major source of uncertainty for the inflation outlook. While the risks to the global outlook seem more balanced than they have been for some time, the prospects for a pick-up in global growth remain subject to significant uncertainty. If the global recovery were to fall short of current expectations, prospects for the Australian economy would be adversely affected and global deflationary forces could gain momentum. The outcome would be weaker inflationary pressures in Australia. ", " Sources of upside risks to the inflation outlook include a stronger-than-expected construction sector and continuing housing price increases, together with firmer conditions in the Australian labour market. In a scenario with a reasonably benign world environment, these factors could see a strengthening of demand pressures and hence upward pressure on wage and price inflation. At present, the risks to the inflation forecast appear to be evenly balanced. ", " The world economy has been subject to a series of ‘one-off’ events over recent years, the latest of which has been the outbreak of the respiratory disease known as SARS in mid March. Initially, the disease spread quickly, sparking fears of a possible global health crisis. However, effective public health responses meant that by early July, the World Health Organisation (WHO) was able to declare the SARS outbreak contained and had lifted all SARS-related travel warnings. In total, around 8,500 cases of the disease have been detected and 800 deaths recorded, with countries in east Asia most affected (Graph A1). The number of cases has been considerably less than that initially feared and much less than the 250,000 to 500,000 deaths that occur worldwide from influenza each year. ", " International organisations generally estimated the adverse effect of SARS on GDP growth in non-Japan Asia to be around ½ percentage point, with the effect concentrated in the June quarter. The economic impact was quickly apparent in the international travel data. Given their heavy reliance on tourism, and their importance as business centres, Hong Kong and Singapore have been the hardest hit, with international arrivals falling by 70 per cent between March and May (Graph A2). The effect of this fall was compounded by a sharp drop in spending by domestic residents with retail sales falling by 8½ per cent in Hong Kong in April. While international arrivals and retail spending have since recovered somewhat, both the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Hong Kong and Singapore</span> economies appear to have contracted sharply in the June quarter. China's economy was also adversely affected by SARS in the June quarter, although year-ended growth remained almost 7 per cent. More generally, the economic effect of SARS on east Asian economies seems to have been less than was originally feared. ", " While SARS was largely confined to Asia, it led to a world-wide downturn in international travel that affected many countries, including Australia. Internal quarantine arrangements saw a sharp drop-off in international travel from SARS-affected countries, and by those travellers from Europe and the United States seeking to avoid Asian stopovers. There was also less outbound travel from those countries that are traditionally sensitive to travel warnings, such as Japan. For Australia, the drop-off in inbound travellers from Japan contributed significantly to the decline of around 20 per cent in international arrivals between January and May this year. In June, however, there was some pick-up in international travel with overseas arrivals increasing from south east Asia, while arrivals from China and Japan remained very low (see Graph A3 and the chapter on the ‘<a href=\"#balance-of-payments\">Balance of Payments</a>’). Furthermore, airport bodies report that the recovery in arrivals continued into July and that forward bookings for August are looking more positive. ", " The ongoing integration of China into the world economy is reshaping the trading patterns of many countries, including Australia. Over the past year, the value of China's international trade has risen by around 35 per cent, and in the March quarter, China surpassed Japan to become the third largest goods trading country in the world (Graph B1). China now accounts for around 5 per cent of world merchandise trade, up from 2 per cent 10 years ago. ", " The majority of China's trade is with countries in the Asian region, with around 65 per cent of China's imports sourced from the region, and around half its exports going to the region (Table B1). China's trade with a number of Asian countries, most notably Japan, Korea and Taiwan, has grown particularly strongly, and this has contributed to a 32 per cent rise in intra-regional east Asian trade since 1999. Excluding China, intra-regional trade has increased by a much more modest 13 per cent over this period. China has also recorded strong growth in trade with countries outside Asia, with exports outside the region more than doubling since 1999. In contrast, east Asia's exports (excluding China) to the rest of the world are broadly the same as they were in 1999. ", " China runs large trade deficits with most east Asian countries, but these are more than offset by trade surpluses with the United States and Europe. Overall, China's trade surplus has averaged around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> of GDP over recent years. ", " China's imports and exports are both dominated by manufactured goods, with intermediate manufactured goods, including machinery and transport equipment, comprising a higher share of imports than <span class=\"no-wrap\">exports (Table B2)</span>. In part, this reflects the increasingly important role that China plays in the processing of higher value-added goods. Both imports and exports of information technology and communications (ITC) equipment have grown strongly over recent years, with China now accounting for a larger proportion of world ITC equipment exports than any other country in the region except Japan. ", " Like a number of other countries, Australia has benefited from the rapid growth in China's trade, with its merchandise exports to China more than doubling over the past four years. China is now the fourth most important destination for Australia's exports, up from tenth position in 1990. The main impetus to this increase has come from China's demand for resources, with resource exports having grown at an average annual rate of 15 per cent over the past decade (Graph B2). As a result of this sustained growth, the share of Australia's total exports to China accounted for by resources has increased from 45 per cent in 1990 to around two-thirds today. Overall, Australia has maintained its share of Chinese imports since the late 1980s, with Australia accounting for around 10 per cent of China's resource and rural-based imports on average. ", " Australia's imports from China have also grown rapidly over recent years, with over 90 per cent of merchandise imports being manufactured goods, of which an increasing share is ITC equipment. The strong growth in low-cost imports from China has contributed to the relatively weak pricing pressures in the markets for many manufactured goods. ", " Since the devaluation in 1994, China has maintained its exchange rate within a 0.3 per cent band either side of its target rate<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnc1\" id=\"rc1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> (Graph C1). In the context of continuing trade surpluses, strong capital inflows and sharply rising official reserves (Graph C2), there have been calls from time to time from various commentators for China to free up its exchange rate, with the implication that it should appreciate. ", " Financial markets pricing suggests that market participants see the possibility of a revaluation of renminbi as having increased. This is evident in both implied volatilities from the currency options market and in non-deliverable forward (NDF) rates. The implied volatility from a currency option is a measure of the variability that the market sees in future movements in the exchange rate over the life of the option contract. In the context of a fixed exchange rate, implied volatility largely reflects the expectations of an upward or downward adjustment to the peg. Over the past year, on two occasions when US officials have talked about the possibility of China adopting a more flexible exchange rate, there has been a significant reaction in the options market. In June 2003, for example, implied volatilities on options to buy or sell renminbi rose sharply from around 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent for 1-year contracts, and from 0.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent for 3-month contracts (Graph C3). Also implied volatilities were larger for ‘out of the money’ options to buy renminbi, than for equally ‘out of the money’ options to sell the currency, thereby suggesting that the balance of expectations was skewed towards an appreciation of the Chinese currency against the US dollar. ", " Another gauge of the anticipated direction of a change in the value of renminbi is the NDF rates relative to the spot exchange rate. NDFs are forward contracts in which, at the expiry of the contract, the difference between the prevailing spot exchange rate and the contract rate is settled in cash. ", " Given that China has higher interest rates than the US, in the absence of expectations of a change in the target exchange rate one would expect the forward exchange rate (expressed as yuan per US dollar) to be higher than the spot exchange rate so as to eliminate the possibility of earning a risk-free profit over the term of the contract. However, since November 2002, NDF rates have typically been below the prevailing spot exchange rate. The discrepancy between NDF rates and the spot exchange rate was particularly pronounced in June 2003, when NDF rates temporarily fell 2 per cent below the spot exchange rate for one year contracts, and 0.4 per cent below the spot exchange rate for 3-month contracts (Graph C4). This suggests that investors had attached a higher probability to an upward revaluation of renminbi, with expectations being more pronounced at longer horizons.

Most of the major economies showed little or no growth in the final months of the year, although there have remained areas of relatively strong performance among the smaller and medium-sized economies, notably in parts of east Asia. Australia, too, has continued to perform quite strongly, though prospects will depend importantly on how quickly the momentum in the major economies is regained. ", " Whether the recent weakness in the major economies signals a sustained setback to the global recovery, or represents a more temporary pause in growth, remains to be seen, and in this respect the US economy will remain an important driver of global trends. Despite posting good growth on average in the first three quarters of 2002, the US still appears to be hampered to some extent by the imbalances that had earlier pushed the economy into recession. In particular, business profits are still weak, and corporate balance sheets remain in relatively poor condition. On the other hand, household spending has been quite resilient, and macroeconomic policies are providing considerable stimulus. In addition to the sharp reductions in official interest rates since early 2001, fiscal policy has made a strong contribution to spending growth over the past two years, with an additional package likely to add further to growth in the year ahead. It may well be that these measures are sufficient to generate a self-sustaining expansion. Certainly they have been well timed, in the sense of providing a powerful stimulus at around the low-point in the economic cycle. ", " Among the other main economic regions, growth has generally been disappointing. The euro area has grown only very modestly over the past year, and has shown little sign of generating any pick-up in domestic demand, though the recent reductions in official interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB) will provide some stimulus. The Japanese economy, despite being weighed down by longstanding structural problems, experienced some export-led growth during the first three quarters of 2002, but turned down again in line with the weaker global conditions towards the end of the year. The main exceptions to the generally disappointing international picture have been in east Asia, with China and Korea in particular both continuing to grow strongly. ", " The weakening in world economic growth in the closing months of 2002, reinforced by the uncertainties over Iraq, was reflected in three main developments in global financial markets: renewed weakness in equity prices, falls in bond yields, and a further decline in the US dollar. It also led to the resumption of monetary easing by a number of central banks, including importantly both the US Federal Reserve and the ECB. For the industrial countries as a whole, official interest rates are at average levels not previously seen in the post-war period. ", " Some of these recent international developments have had direct effects on Australian financial markets. Domestic long-term interest rates, which tend to be heavily influenced by those in the US, have fallen noticeably, for example. There has also been a tendency for markets to price in some possibility of an easing in domestic monetary policy, perhaps reflecting the tendency towards easing that seems to be apparent globally. In addition, the Australian dollar has risen against the weakening US dollar, though not against other major currencies, so the trade-weighted value of the Australian dollar (the most appropriate measure of the exchange rate) has risen only modestly. On the other hand, the Australian share market, while it has weakened a little, continues to be much more robust than most share markets overseas; the relative strength of the local economy has no doubt been a factor in this. ", " The Australian economy has continued to expand at a good pace in the recent period, despite the continued drag from the weak world economy and the drought. This outcome reflected continued strong growth in domestic demand, though the pace moderated somewhat in the second half of last year. The ongoing expansion of the economy has been sufficient to generate a further strengthening of the labour market, with the unemployment rate declining significantly during 2002. Another consequence of the strength in domestic demand, against the background of the weak global economy, is that Australia's current account deficit has widened significantly. ", " The business sector in Australia appears to be in much better shape than its counterparts abroad. Profitability is relatively high, and most surveys report that businesses are viewing current conditions as quite favourable. Notwithstanding some high-profile corporate failures during the past couple of years, businesses in aggregate are carrying low levels of debt, have strong internal funding, and have generally avoided the mistakes of over-investment that have characterised past business cycles. Against this background, it is not surprising that business investment is contributing strongly to expenditure growth at present or that employment is continuing to expand. Forward indicators of investment intentions and projects underway confirm that there are good prospects for further growth. The main risk to a continuation of these favourable trends would arise if there were a significant deterioration in confidence about future conditions associated with the international outlook. However, there is little indication that this is occurring at present; although there have been some signs of diminished confidence recently based on evidence from business surveys, they have generally been quite modest. ", " Household spending has also been contributing strongly to growth in the recent period, though the pace slowed to some extent in the second half of last year. The major determinants of consumer spending are supportive of continued growth. Consumer confidence remains above average, while real wage increases and strong employment growth have boosted household incomes in aggregate, though incomes in the rural sector have deteriorated sharply. Household borrowing has also continued at a rapid pace, a process that has been associated with rising housing prices. ", " The other major driver of the growth of domestic demand has been the upswing in housing construction. In some respects this has followed the pattern of a conventional housing cycle, though an important additional factor over the past couple of years was a much sharper run-up in investor demand than had been observed in earlier cycles. As has been discussed in previous <em>Statements</em>, this process has been closely inter-related with the increases in housing prices seen in recent years, with new investors being drawn to the market by expectations of continued capital gains. ", " Putting aside these short-run effects on household expenditures, the run-up in housing prices and associated expansion in housing-related debt were a source of concern for most of the past year, given the potential of such a process to remain disconnected from fundamentals and develop into a significant imbalance over time. These risks, however, appear to have eased somewhat in recent months. There is some evidence that investor activity, which had been a major driver of the market over the past two years, has moderated. Conditions of oversupply have led to cancellation of a number of multi-unit construction projects due to a lack of buyer interest, and there are signs that market pressures on housing prices have eased. ", " The Australian economy in aggregate looks set to continue to grow at a good pace although slower than last year. Indications are that the housing construction cycle will peak some time around the middle of this year, which would entail a slowing in domestic demand from its recent rapid pace. On the other hand, the weak external conditions are probably exerting close to their maximum negative impact on non-rural exports. Hence barring a renewed deterioration in the global outlook, the external sector should provide some offset to the slowing in domestic demand over time, which would represent a desirable rebalancing of growth. At some point, too, it must be expected that rural conditions will improve, though the timing of that event is of course highly uncertain. ", " Australia's inflation rate in the second half of 2002 evolved broadly in line with the near-term outlook presented in recent <em>Statements</em>. During the year to December 2002 underlying inflation was around 2½ per cent, having declined from just over 3 per cent at the end of the previous year. The main factor contributing to the decline in underlying inflation appears to have been the fading of the impact of the exchange rate depreciation that took place over the period 1998–2000. In addition to this impact from the traded goods sector, there was some easing in wage costs and upstream price pressures during much of 2002, though this appeared to have run its course by the end of the year. The Bank's current assessment is that underlying inflation is likely to remain close to its recent level of 2½ per cent over the next 18 months. This represents a slight downward revision to the forecast presented in the previous <em>Statement</em>. ", " CPI inflation, at 3 per cent over the past year, has been slightly higher than underlying measures, reflecting a number of sector-specific influences including airfares, insurance costs, oil prices, and the impact of the drought on food prices. While the latter two factors will remain in the CPI inflation rate for a while yet, they are expected to reverse over time, so that CPI inflation returns to the underlying rate over the forecast horizon. The risks around this inflation forecast are judged to be evenly balanced. ", " As discussed in the main body of the <em>Statement</em>, financial conditions at present are moderately expansionary, in that the level of short-term interest rates is below medium-term historical benchmarks, and finance is readily available to businesses and households. Under normal circumstances, conditions of above-average growth in domestic demand such as those prevailing over the past year would have suggested a case for moving to a less expansionary setting, in order to avoid contributing to inflationary risks. However, the case for doing so progressively weakened through the second half of 2002 as risks to the global recovery increased. ", " At the time of the February Board meeting, it was clear that the international outlook had not improved, with incoming information generally confirming the loss of momentum in the major economies late last year and a general increase in geopolitical uncertainty. There is thus a risk that the recent international weakness will become more protracted and will weigh more significantly on growth in Australia than it has done to date. In these circumstances, the Board judged that the best course was to leave the cash rate unchanged, while continuing to monitor the direction of the global and Australian economies. ", " The recovery in the world economy lost momentum towards the end of 2002. This occurred in the US through a slowing in domestic demand growth, led by weaker household consumption, while in Europe and Japan through a weakening in external demand growth. Non-Japan Asia continued to be an exception, though some countries in the region are now recording more modest growth. Forecasts of world economic growth have been revised down in recent months, with the most significant downward revisions being for the European economies. The latest Consensus forecasts are for growth in the G7 group of countries in 2003 of around 2 per cent, rising to around 2¾ per cent in 2004. In response to the weaker outcomes and uncertain outlook, policy settings have been adjusted in the major economies, with the US recently announcing a further expansionary fiscal package, and the ECB lowering its policy rate by 50 basis points in early December. ", " The quarterly profile of US economic growth through 2002 was volatile. Output rose strongly in the first and third quarters of the year, but growth was weak in the other two quarters. After rising by 1 per cent in the September quarter, GDP increased by 0.2 per cent in the December quarter, to be 2.8 per cent higher <span class=\"no-wrap\">over the year (Graph 1)</span>. ", " The main source of this volatility and of the slowdown in growth in the December quarter was household spending (Table 1). The weaker consumption growth towards the end of 2002 was especially marked for consumer durables, reflecting lower motor vehicle sales; abstracting from car sales removes much of the volatility. The slowdown in consumption growth is in line with the renewed weakness in the labour market. The unemployment rate rose back to 6 per cent in the quarter and non-farm payrolls fell significantly in both November and December, to be around the level recorded early in 2002 (Graph 2). A softer labour market and weaker equity prices are also likely to have affected sentiment. The Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence fell again in January, to around its lowest level in nine years. Notwithstanding these negative factors, growth in household disposable income has held up reasonably well, reflecting steady wages growth and tax cuts in mid 2001 and early 2002. ", " One area of relative strength in the US economy is the housing sector. Residential investment grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.7 per cent</span> in the December quarter, to be 6.1 per cent higher over the year. Dwelling starts and sales data from the end of last year remain at a high level, auguring well for activity in the beginning of 2003. ", " The robust rate of US household spending through most of last year underpinned a strong rise in US imports. Over the year to the December quarter, the volume of imports grew by 9.2 per cent. Growth in the volume of <span class=\"no-wrap\">US exports</span> has been lower over the same period, at 5.0 per cent. As a result of these trends, the external trade deficit increased further, to 4.3 per cent of GDP in the December quarter. ", " Indicators from the business sector generally suggest a continuation of soft conditions (Graph 3). Manufacturing output fell by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, though the low level of the inventories-to-sales ratio suggests a rise in production is likely in the future. In contrast to the decline in production, the ISM survey of businesses provided a more upbeat assessment of conditions around the turn of the year, with particular strength in the new orders component. There are some signs that the decline in business investment has come to an end. After decreasing for eight consecutive quarters, business investment rose by 0.4 per cent in the December quarter. Spending on equipment has recorded small rises for the past three quarters but spending on structures has continued to decline. ", " Primarily reflecting rising energy costs, consumer price inflation in the past few months has risen to be just under 2½ per cent in year-ended terms. However, the core measure of inflation has continued to drift down, and at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, is around ¾ of a percentage point lower than it was at the beginning of 2002. The divergence of inflation rates between prices of goods and services remains, with core services prices rising by 3½ per cent over the year to December and core goods prices falling by 1½ per cent. In line with softer labour market conditions, growth in labour compensation has continued to ease. The employment cost index increased by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, reflecting slower growth in the wage component, to be 3.4 per cent higher than a <span class=\"no-wrap\">year ago</span>. ", " In response to the continued uncertainty over the prospects for recovery, the Bush Administration is proposing an additional fiscal package worth US$670 billion over a decade, of which US$100 billion (1 per cent of GDP) is planned over the next year. This is in addition to the sizeable fiscal boost to the economy over the past two years, and the substantial monetary stimulus, equivalent to a cumulative 525 basis points since the beginning of 2001 (see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A: US Macroeconomic Policy Developments</a>’ for more details). ", " After growing modestly in the first half of the year, activity in the Japanese economy stalled in the latter part of 2002, as the strong pick-up in exports evident earlier in the year levelled out (Graph 4). This was reflected in weaker industrial production in the December quarter, though the level of production remains nearly 6 per cent higher than a year ago. With limited momentum in domestic demand, the services sector, as measured by the Tertiary Activity Index, remained weak in the second half of 2002. In line with these trends, the December quarter Tankan survey showed weaker sentiment in the services sector. ", " The weakness in those parts of the Japanese economy focused on domestic activity is consistent with difficult conditions in the household sector. Consumer confidence is well below long-run average levels, the unemployment rate has held close to the historical high of 5.5 per cent over the past six months or so, and employment resumed a downward trend in the latter part of the year, and is now nearly 2½ per cent lower than the most recent peak two years ago. In line with the weak labour market, earnings have continued to fall. Prices have fallen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> over the past five years and by 0.2 per cent over the year to December (Graph 5). ", " Non-Japan Asia was one area of relative economic strength through much of last year. But towards the <span class=\"no-wrap\">end of 2002</span> the rate of growth for the area as a whole appears to have slowed. There was also a moderation in export growth, which was concentrated among intra-regional exports; exports to countries outside the region have continued to grow strongly (Graph 6). Divergent trends between economies in the region also became more apparent over the latter part of last year (Table 2). While China and Korea continued to perform well, with production and exports remaining strong, industrial production in Malaysia and Taiwan stabilised and conditions in Singapore deteriorated. Consistent with ongoing strong productivity gains in China and surplus capacity in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Hong Kong</span>, prices continue to decline in year-ended terms, while in Singapore and Taiwan inflation is currently just above zero, following declining prices through most of 2002. ", " The New Zealand economy grew by 1.0 per cent in the September quarter and by 4.6 per cent over the year. Growth was supported by domestic demand, with higher household expenditure on consumer items and new housing construction and a build-up of inventories more than offsetting a contraction in exports. Year-ended inflation in the December quarter, at 2.7 per cent, remains towards the top of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's target band. ", " For some time now the euro area economy has been growing at a rate well below potential. GDP in the euro area barely increased in the September quarter, to be 0.8 per cent higher than a year earlier. Much of the growth over the year relied on a pick-up in exports, as domestic demand remained subdued, though in the September quarter there were some signs of a more evenly balanced composition of growth. These aggregate developments mask diverse cyclical positions among the euro area countries. While many of the smaller euro area economies have recorded reasonable growth outcomes, the German economy has continued to stagnate. German output is estimated to have risen by just 0.2 per cent in 2002, implying broadly flat output in the December quarter. Indicators suggest that industrial output growth in Italy and France was also weak in the latter part of 2002. ", " Euro area consumer confidence has declined for several months now, to reach a five-year low (Graph 7). Business sentiment surveys in all the euro area countries except France also weakened towards the end of last year, although the European Commission area-wide measure has remained relatively stable. Notwithstanding slow growth, the labour market has remained resilient, with the unemployment rate in December only <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.5 percentage</span> points above its trough in 2001, at 8.5 per cent. Year-ended employment growth has slowed in all the large euro area economies, especially in Germany, where the number of employees has declined for the past 12 months. ", " Higher oil prices contributed to volatility in consumer price inflation over the past year. However, core consumer price inflation, which excludes oil, has remained broadly steady at around 2¼ per cent over the year to December <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 8)</span>. Reflecting the lack of inflationary pressures and sluggish economic activity, the ECB cut its policy rate by 50 basis points in December. But despite the weak economic growth, the scope for discretionary expansionary fiscal policy is curtailed in a number of euro area countries because fiscal balances are already close to, or in breach of, the limits set by the Stability and Growth Pact. ", " Growth slowed towards the end of 2002 in the United Kingdom, with GDP expanding by 0.4 per cent in the December quarter, to be 2.2 per cent higher over the year. Divergent trends in the manufacturing and service sectors, evident for several years now, continued in the December quarter, with manufacturing activity declining while growth in services output remained strong. Continued strong consumption growth has been underpinned by solid labour market outcomes – with unemployment falling further in the second half of 2002 to historically low levels – as well as by higher house prices and low interest rates, spurring greater borrowing against rising house values. Year-ended inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) rose to 2¾ per cent in December, from around 2 per cent in the middle of last year. Fiscal policy is expected to be expansionary both this year and next year, and follows a stimulus equivalent to nearly 2 percentage points of GDP in 2002. ", " Oil prices have risen sharply since the beginning of December, though they remain below the peaks reached around the time of the Gulf war (Graph 9). The rise in oil prices has primarily reflected the general strike in Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter, and the tensions in the Middle East. With the price of crude oil above the upper end of the OPEC target price range, OPEC members decided in mid January to raise official production quota levels by 1.5 million barrels per day from the beginning of February, although this announcement had little effect on prices. ", " If these higher oil prices are sustained for an extended period, world output growth would be adversely affected and inflation would be higher. IMF estimates suggest that a sustained increase in the oil price of US$5 per barrel would reduce world growth by at least 0.3 percentage points in the following year or so. There is more variation in the impact on inflation across countries: the IMF estimates the rise would be greatest in the US, reflecting its high energy intensity of production, while in Japan a more subdued impact is likely. (For more details on the effect of oil prices on the world economy,  see <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2000/nov/1.html#box-a\">Box A</a> in the November 2000 <em>Statement of Monetary Policy</em>.) ", " Reflecting the possible stalling in economic growth noted in the previous chapter, central banks in the US and the euro area resumed easing monetary policy towards the end of 2002. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, to 1.25 per cent, in November and the European Central Bank cut by 50 points, to 2.75 per cent, in December. ", " The current level of policy rates in the US is unusually low – the lowest since the early 1960s. Nonetheless, markets are starting to price in the possibility of further rate cuts by the US Fed, amid concerns that economic weakness in the US could persist longer than earlier thought (Graph 10). ", " The level of policy rates in the euro area is also relatively low, though the period to which one must look to find similarly low rates in Europe (Germany) is only October 1999. Financial markets are very strongly of the view that there will be rate cuts in Europe in the months ahead. ", " Outside the euro area, a couple of other European countries have also cut rates recently (Table 3). Sweden cut rates by 50 points over the December quarter, to 3.75 per cent. It had been one of the countries raising rates in the first half of last year, but the recent change in the international economic outlook and in its domestic inflation outlook was enough to cause it to change direction. Norway, which had also raised rates in the first half of 2002, cut rates by 50 points in both December and January. ", " Among the other developed economies, official rates have been held steady since around the middle of <span class=\"no-wrap\">last year (Graph 11)</span>. In most cases these countries had been raising rates in the first half of 2002, as their economic activity returned to normal rates of expansion, but they subsequently paused as international uncertainty grew. Among this group, Canada, which still has relatively low interest rates (2.75 per cent) has recently signalled that it may need to raise rates further if the strength of its domestic economy continues. Others, however, seem to be closer to easing. In the UK, some members of the Monetary Policy Committee have been voting in favour of a cut for some months now, while in New Zealand, which has relatively high interest rates and a sharply appreciating exchange rate, the central bank has signalled that it may ease if current trends continue. ", " Among emerging market economies, a clear distinction can be drawn between Asia and Latin America. Official interest rates in Asia are for the most part at low levels and recent moves have all been in the downward direction. The central banks in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand all cut rates in recent months. In Latin America, in contrast, interest rates are at high levels in the main economies (20–25 per cent) due to continuing economic difficulties. In the case of Argentina, these levels are well down on those reached in the peak of the crisis a year ago, though Brazil has raised its official rates by about 750 basis points over the past few months as the central bank tries to quell resurgent inflation. ", " Global long-term interest rates are again falling after having stabilised for a while in late 2002. In the US, for example, after the Fed cut official rates in November, 10-year bond yields rose to 4.25 per cent, as the share market recovered and sentiment about the economy more generally improved. But, in recent weeks, yields have fallen back below 4 per cent (Graph 12). While this is still above the low-point of 3.57 per cent last October, when economic pessimism was at its peak, it is down by about 110 basis points from a year earlier. This is a large fall in bond yields and gives some indication of the extent to which economic sentiment deteriorated through 2002. The fall in yields has reflected not so much a reduction in inflation expectations, but a fall in real yields, as indicated by indexed bonds. Yields on 10-year indexed bonds are now around 1.9 per cent, less than half the level at their peak in early 2000 and the lowest reading since indexed bonds were introduced in the mid 1990s. ", " European long-term interest rates did not fall as much as those in the US in the second half of 2002 as the downward revisions to the US growth outlook, for a time, were more pronounced. As such, by the end of that year European yields were 40 basis points higher than corresponding US yields, whereas at the start of the year the level had been fairly similar in both regions. More recently, however, with market analysts being surprised by the weakness in European growth, long-term yields in that region have fallen quite sharply and the gap between US and European yields has narrowed again to a few basis points. ", " In Japan, bond yields have been on a steady downward trend since early 2002 as markets increasingly came to the view that the economic recovery would be anaemic. The yield on 10-year government bonds fell to an historical low of 0.76 per cent in late January. ", " Spreads between US corporate bonds and Treasuries have narrowed significantly in recent months from their previously elevated levels. The easing is noticeable across all of the credit ratings, with the spread between ‘junk’ bonds and Treasuries falling from a peak of about 900 basis points in October to around 630 basis points now; that on A-rated paper has fallen from 200 points to 120 points (Graph 13). These falls have seen spreads narrow to levels that prevailed before the 2001 recession in the US. Normally such a narrowing in spreads could be taken as a sign of a significant decline in risk aversion in markets, but on this occasion such an assessment does not seem consistent with other developments in markets, such as the nervousness pervading share markets. In part, the narrowing in spreads probably reflects the passing of the extreme uncertainty that gripped markets last year after a few high profile corporate collapses, but it also probably reflects the tendency of investors to chase relatively high yields in a generally low-yield environment. In 2000, for example, if yields on BBB-rated US corporate bonds were expressed as a ratio of yields on US Treasuries, they averaged around 40 per cent higher; by late 2002, they reached 100 per cent higher, a relativity not seen since the early 1940s. Such a large gap may have encouraged some investors to the view that the premium for credit risk was attractive given the rates on offer elsewhere. ", " Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt have narrowed by around 120 basis points over the past three months, reflecting improved perceptions of sovereign risk in both Latin America and the emerging European economies. Spreads on Asian sovereign debt also narrowed, and remain at much lower levels than in the other two regions (Graph 14). ", " Equity markets seemed to get a boost in late 2002 both by the anticipation and the announcement of the Fed easing. Some commentators came to the view that the market had finally bottomed. By December, however, the upward move in share prices was starting to lose momentum and, in the past month or so, equity prices around the world have been falling noticeably again (Graph 15, Table 4). The main factor in this renewed weakness is the disappointing run of economic data and corporate profit announcements, though uncertainty about the likely conflict with Iraq may also have made investors more cautious. ", " In 2002, broad stock indices in the major markets recorded their third consecutive annual decline, for the first time since 1939–41 in the US and since 1929–31 in Germany. While the broad-based Japanese indices have also fallen for three consecutive years, this continues the trend seen since the bubble burst in 1989, with the Topix falling in 9 of the 13 years since then. ", " After three years of falls accumulating to 40–60 per cent, history would suggest that share prices were at or near their bottom. There has only been one occasion in the past 130 years in the US when share prices have fallen for four years in a row; that was during the Depression years. Yet on various methods of valuation, share prices still look high compared with historical norms. For example, the P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 remains around 27, which is around twice the long-run average (Graph 16). Similarly, the ratio of share market capitalisation to GDP in the US also remains higher than normal. It seems that share markets are continuing to overestimate rates of growth of nominal GDP, and therefore corporate profitability. Even though <em>real</em> GDP growth over the past couple of years has held up better than in the recession of the early 1990s, this is not the case for <em>nominal</em> GDP, which for share markets is more relevant than real GDP. In 2001, nominal GDP growth was only half that seen in 1991 and even though there was a pick-up in nominal GDP growth in 2002, the growth rate remained around that seen in 1991. In this environment, it is not surprising that analysts' expectations of corporate profits have been overly optimistic. The National Accounts measure of net corporate profits in fact fell in the first three quarters of 2002 (the latest period for which data are available) and the level of profits is only about the same as in 1996 (Graph 17). ", " As in the US, European equity markets have fallen recently, as continued uncertainty surrounding both the economic outlook and developments in the Middle East weigh on investor confidence (Graph 15). While much of the weakness seen in European equities over the course of 2002 was driven by concerns in the banking and finance sectors, these sectors recovered in the later stages of 2002 and have generally performed in line with the broad market over recent months. The recent weakness appears to be driven by a re-evaluation of the cyclical economic prospects, with the retail and consumer sectors particularly hard hit. At the same time, rising oil prices have impacted negatively on the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sectors. ", " In Japan, equity markets remain weak. Although the major indices appear to have stabilised somewhat after the steady declines seen over the second half of 2002, they remain near the 18-year lows seen in December 2002 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 15)</span>. The Bank of Japan commenced stock purchases from banks in early December and by late January had purchased around <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>380 billion (out of its announced program of <span class=\"yen\">¥</span>2 trillion). ", " In the Asian emerging markets, stock markets have fallen slightly on average since the last <em>Statement</em>, although this reflected a mixed performance across the region. The Taiwanese equity market performed best, with prices up 10 per cent, followed by an increase of 6 per cent in Indonesia. These gains were offset by declines of <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> in Singapore, 9 per cent in Korea, and 3 per cent in Hong Kong. In contrast to other markets, share prices in Latin America generally rebounded strongly over the past three months. The Argentinean stock index increased by 30 per cent over this period, while stock indices in Chile and Peru each rose by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span>. ", " A significant development in international financial markets over recent months has been the resumption of the depreciation of the US dollar. In trade-weighted terms, it has now fallen 13½ per cent from its early 2002 peak with about half that fall coming in the past few months (Graph 18). The recent decline has been attributed to various specific factors, including heightened concerns about the sustainability of the US's current account deficit, the anaemic economic recovery and concerns about the potential impact of any war in Iraq. More generally, however, it appears that interest rate differentials are again emerging as an important influence on exchange rates. This is in contrast to the second half of the 1990s and into 2000, when equity investment was important in global capital flows and the impact of interest rate differentials on exchange rates seemed to diminish. ", " The decline in the US dollar has been broadly based, with falls of 2 per cent against the yen, 8 per cent against the euro and Swiss franc, and 4½ per cent against the pound since the end of October (Table 5). ", " The euro, on the other hand, appears to have been independently strong, appreciating against all major currencies. From its October 2000 trough, it is now up about 22 per cent in trade-weighted terms and about <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span> bilaterally against the US dollar. ", " Outside Europe, one of the strongest currencies has been the New Zealand dollar, which has risen to a three-year high of 0.55 against the US dollar. It has also risen strongly against the Australian dollar, with the bilateral rate appreciating to 1.076 from 1.13 at end November. ", " Asian currencies have not risen as much as some others against the US dollar over recent months, continuing their more stable relationship over recent years. Latin American currencies were also flat on average against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span>, with an 11 per cent rise in the Argentine peso offset by a 26 per cent fall in the Venezuelan bolivar. ", " The Australian dollar has strengthened against the generally weakening US dollar over the past few months, particularly in January when it rose 5 per cent. The exchange rate is currently around US59 cents, its highest level against the US currency since August 2000 (Graph 19). Since the lows reached in April 2001, the exchange rate has appreciated by 23 per cent against the US dollar. ", " The picture in trade-weighted terms is, however, very different as the recent strength of the Australian dollar against the US dollar is in large part due to the latter's weakness. The TWI has risen only 2½ per cent since the end of November 2002 (Graph 20). The rise against the US dollar has been offset by falls against the euro, pound, Swiss franc, Swedish krona and the New Zealand dollar (Table 6). The current level of the TWI (53.5) remains below that of mid 2002. ", " Demand for Australian assets from Japan has been very strong, reflected in record amounts of uridashi issuance ($6.2 billion during January and early February) (Graph 21). Short-term speculative positions on the Chicago futures exchange have also moved long, as they did in early 2002 when the market was <span class=\"no-wrap\">rising (Graph 22)</span>. ", " Taking a longer-term view of the exchange rate, the current level of the TWI (the most appropriate measure to look at) is marginally below the long-term average. Since the mid 1980s depreciation, the TWI has been within a band between 49 and 62 for most of the time, with an average of 55.5. It is now about 3½ per cent below that average (Graph 23). ", " The Bank's market and other purchases of foreign currency in recent months have more than covered the Government's requirements. There have been net purchases of some $960 million over the past three months. Earnings on foreign reserves added a further $490 million over this period, but valuation effects reduced reserves by around $400 million. Net reserves currently stand at $12.1 billion, up from $7 billion this time last year. Foreign currency swaps outstanding have declined a little recently as, for liquidity management reasons, the Bank has repaid some swaps. Swaps outstanding at end January were $24 billion, down $2.2 billion over the past three months and around $5.6 billion over the past year. Gross reserves – i.e. net reserves plus foreign currency held under swaps – were $36 billion at the end of January, about the same as a year earlier. ", " According to the latest national accounts, real GDP rose by 0.9 per cent in the September quarter, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.7 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier (Table 7). Growth in domestic final demand was particularly strong, increasing by around 6 per cent over the year, reflecting solid growth in consumer spending coupled with the continued upswing in housing activity and a recovery in business investment. A marked divergence between domestic and external demand remains a feature of Australia's recent economic performance (Graph 24). Some of the growth in domestic demand has been met by a sharp rise in import volumes, which, together with a fall in export volumes owing to subdued external demand, has resulted in net exports subtracting around 3 percentage points from growth in GDP over the year to the September quarter. The first noticeable effects of the drought on agricultural production were also evident in the quarter, with farm GDP subtracting 0.4 percentage points from overall output growth. ", " Some slowing in output growth is expected in coming quarters as the full force of the drought is felt. Output of the farm sector, which typically accounts for about 3 per cent of total production, is projected to fall by about one-third over the year to the June quarter. This will also have an adverse effect on other parts of the economy with strong linkages to agriculture. The outlook for the rest of the economy, however, remains positive. Forward indicators suggest that activity in the dwelling sector will peak around the middle of the year, but other sources of demand should remain solid. Conditions in the non-farm business sector remain quite positive, with most measures of business confidence at levels typically associated with around trend growth in output. Capital expenditure intentions and the large number of non-residential construction projects in the pipeline indicate that the strong growth in business investment over the past year should continue in the period ahead. Consumption should remain supported by favourable conditions in the labour market, though employment growth is likely to moderate from its current rapid pace. ", " Growth in household spending eased back towards more sustainable levels in the second half of 2002, with retail sales volumes growing at an annualised rate of 3 per cent over this period, compared with 8 per cent over the first half of the year (Graph 25). The strength in consumer spending over 2002 has largely been in discretionary items, with the volume of sales at clothing and soft goods retailers rising by 10 per cent over the year. Growth in sales of household goods eased in the second half of the year, though sales remain at a high level, underpinned by the strength in dwelling investment. Household spending on motor vehicles fell towards the end of the year, though this followed a period of very strong sales. ", " Further solid growth in consumption seems likely in view of the strong growth in employment, which should continue to support household incomes. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment remains well above its long-run average level, though it has eased from the very high levels recorded in the first <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of 2002</span>. The latter reflects a trend that is also evident in the business sector, with the indices of sentiment relating to an individual's situation remaining above their long-run average levels, while views about general economic conditions have tended to become less optimistic over the course of 2002. ", " Consumer spending also continues to be supported by increases in the value of household assets and increased borrowing. The value of household assets rose by 14½ per cent over the year to the September quarter, largely reflecting strong gains in dwelling prices (Table 8). The rising value of household assets, together with the low cost of borrowing, have contributed to a rapid increase in household borrowing, with credit to households increasing by 18 per cent over the year to December 2002. While most of the recent strength in household borrowing has been for the financing of house purchases, it is likely that some of the rise in mortgage-secured borrowing has been directed towards consumption. ", " Reflecting the strong growth in borrowing over the past few years, household debt has increased from around <span class=\"no-wrap\">80 per cent</span> of household disposable income in 1997 to 122 per cent currently (Graph 26). An alternative indicator of household gearing is the ratio of household debt to household assets. This ratio has also risen over the same period, but by considerably less, reflecting the concurrent strong increases in house prices, and currently is around 15 per cent (Graph 27). ", " Borrowing secured against housing has accounted for nearly all of the increase in household debt since 1997. An unusual feature of this period is that the rise was split more evenly between lending to owner-occupiers and lending to investors than in earlier periods. Lending to investors has increased at an annual rate of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">21 per cent</span> since mid 1997, compared with a rate of 13 per cent for lending for owner-occupation. Despite having grown rapidly over the past five years, credit card debt has accounted for only a small part of the rise in debt given its small share of total household debt. Some of the growth in household debt reflects an increase in the number of borrowers, as the shift to a low inflation/low interest rate environment has broadened the availability of credit to households. However, much of the increase relates to an increase in the average size of borrowing, which has been associated with rising house prices: the average size of a new housing loan approval for owner-occupation has risen from $118,000 in 1997 to $175,000 in 2002. ", " Dwelling investment has continued growing apace, rising by a further 3 per cent in the September quarter, to be 23 per cent higher than a year earlier. Much of the growth has been in the construction of new dwellings, but spending on alterations and additions, which accounts for more than 40 per cent of dwelling investment, has also experienced a rapid pick-up in the last couple of quarters to be 16 per cent higher over the year. ", " Dwelling commencements and the stock of work outstanding continued to rise in the September quarter, indicating further near-term growth in dwelling investment. Further out, however, some fall in housing activity is likely, with the value of owner-occupier housing loan approvals for new construction falling by 17 per cent over the year to November (Graph 28). Local government building approvals for new houses resumed their downward trend in the December quarter after rising sharply in the previous period (Graph 29). The trends are less apparent in the multi-unit sector, where building approvals reached a record level in October. Nonetheless, there are other signs of an easing in activity, with the announcement of several cancellations of major inner-city apartment projects in Melbourne and Brisbane as a result of poor pre-sales. ", " The prospective decline in new housing construction is likely to be partially offset by continued growth in spending on alterations and additions. Loan approvals for alterations and additions have surged in recent months, while the value of building approvals for large alterations and additions is higher over the year. The rise in house prices over recent years has increased the incentive to renovate, and activity in this segment of the market should also be supported over the course of 2003 by an easing in capacity constraints in the building sector. ", " There are some tentative signs of an easing of price pressures in the housing market, after the strong rises over recent years. The value of monthly loan approvals to owner-occupiers for existing dwellings has remained relatively flat for over a year. Auction clearance rates have fallen in Sydney and Melbourne and there has been a fall in the number of properties being auctioned. Declining clearance rates in the past have tended to be associated with weaker demand and a slowing in dwelling prices. ", " Much of the pressure in recent years has been associated with demand from investors, but there are also signs of an easing in pressures in the sectors favoured by investors. Loan approvals to investors appear to have levelled out in recent months, after rising rapidly over the preceding two years. Consistent with an increase in the supply of rental properties, the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) reported that median house and multi-unit dwelling rents were flat or declined somewhat in Sydney and Melbourne in recent quarters, while signs of weakening rental markets have emerged in other cities. In addition, rental vacancy rates as measured by REIA are currently at high levels in most capital cities and have generally been on an upward trend over the past three years. ", " Data available on dwelling prices for the December quarter have been mixed (Table 9). The Residex repeat sales index, which abstracts from compositional changes in the stock of dwellings being sold, suggests that house prices in Sydney rose modestly, while house prices in Melbourne and Brisbane fell. The data also suggest that unit prices rose modestly in the December quarter in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. In contrast, Commonwealth Bank data recorded further strong rises in the December quarter in most cities across Australia, with house prices increasing by 8 per cent and unit prices by 15 per cent in the quarter. However, these data appear to have been affected by the compositional change associated with the declining share of first-time purchasers in the market, who tend to purchase lower-priced properties. ", " Growth in the goods sector continues to be buoyed by the strength in construction and related manufacturing industries (Graph 30). The high levels of consumption spending and construction activity have also underpinned growth in the wholesale trade and transport and storage industries. In contrast, growth in the service sectors has been more subdued, driven largely by weakness in business services. However, the sharp deceleration of growth in business services, which had been evident for much of the past eighteen months as firms reduced discretionary spending, appears to have been arrested. Both business services and tourism are now showing tentative signs of improved conditions. ", " Consistent with this positive tone, business surveys are generally reporting business conditions consistent with strong growth in the non-farm economy (Graph 31). Business conditions, as reported in the broadly based NAB survey, are well above average levels, with firms more exposed to the domestic economy continuing to report the most favourable conditions. The ACCI-Westpac and AIG surveys of the manufacturing sector are also reporting solid business conditions, with indicators of production, employment and new orders around or above their long-run average levels. An exception is the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey, where respondents continue to be pessimistic about most indicators of actual and expected activity. In all the surveys, businesses are less confident about the future than they are about current conditions, but in most surveys business confidence is around its long-run level. ", " The farm sector continues to be severely affected by the drought. ABS projections, based on the most recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecasts of farm production, imply that real farm output is likely to fall by 34 per cent over the year to the June quarter 2003, a decline similar to that experienced in previous major drought episodes (Graph 30). Farm stocks and stocks held by farm marketing authorities, which were built up sharply owing to the very large 2001/02 wheat crop, are also being unwound as the crop is exported. Expectations for farm income and investment, as measured by the Rabobank rural confidence survey, remain very subdued. ", " Corporate profits, as measured by gross operating surplus (GOS), rose by 3¼ per cent in the September quarter and as a share of GDP they remained at levels above the average of the past decade (Graph 32). Strong activity in the retail, wholesale and construction industries was reflected in significant rises in profits in those sectors in the quarter, whereas profits declined in these sectors more exposed to the global economy, in particular mining. The profits of small businesses, as measured by the GOS of unincorporated enterprises, have fallen slightly over the past two quarters, mainly reflecting the effect of the drought on the farm sector, with small businesses in the retail and residential construction sectors faring relatively better. Business surveys generally show that firms in the non-farm sector remain upbeat about the outlook for profits. ", " The high level of corporate profits has boosted retained earnings, with business internal funding reaching <span class=\"no-wrap\">7½ per cent</span> of GDP in the three quarters to September (Graph 33). Non-intermediated debt and equity raisings have also remained at a high level, but recourse to intermediated debt has been relatively low. Business credit increased by 3½ per cent over 2002. While the debt-to-equity ratio for the private non-financial corporate sector rose slightly in the September quarter, this measure of gearing still remains considerably below its average level of the past few years. Accordingly, the interest burden of the business sector remains quite low. ", " The relatively low level of the capital stock as a percentage of GDP, strong growth in domestic demand and the availability of low-cost funding have supported the year-long recovery in investment spending, with business investment rising by 13 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Spending on both machinery and equipment and buildings and structures has increased strongly, while there are also some signs of a recovery in technology investment, with expenditure on computer software growing by around 9 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span> to the September quarter. ", " Further growth in investment spending is likely. While investment as a share of GDP has risen over the past year, it remains well below previous cyclical peaks. Indicators of investment intentions point to a similarly bright outlook. The September quarter ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey suggests that investment in machinery and equipment is expected to grow by around 11 per cent in nominal terms in the current financial year, assuming a five-year average realisation ratio (Graph 34). The pick-up is expected to be concentrated in the mining, manufacturing and transport and storage sectors, with investment in civil aircraft expected to contribute strongly to overall growth in 2002/03. The drought and associated fall in farm income are likely to induce weaker spending on agricultural equipment, providing a restraining influence on overall investment in machinery and equipment. However, the ability of farmers to smooth their pre-tax income using Farm Management Deposits may result in a less pronounced fall in farm investment than has occurred in previous droughts. ", " Forward-looking indicators of investment in buildings and structures remain positive, with activity expected to be underpinned by a considerable build-up of work in the early stages of construction. Resource-related commencements rose to a record high in the September quarter, while spending on infrastructure projects should remain buoyant owing to the large number of major projects commissioned by various state governments (with significant private-sector involvement), particularly in the transport and utilities sectors, but also including preparations for the Commonwealth Games. The recent surge in forward indicators for non-residential construction has resulted in a sizeable amount of work in the pipeline in this sector, particularly relating to office construction and the retail sector. The Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em> also shows a number of sizeable projects in the early stages of planning (mainly resource-related). ", " The ongoing expansion of economic activity is evident in the labour market, with employment increasing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.9 per cent</span> in the December quarter, to be 2.5 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 35). In contrast to the previous year, full-time employment made a significant contribution to total employment growth, accounting for about 40 per cent of the jobs created over the year. Part-time employment continues to grow strongly, increasing by 1.9 per cent in the December quarter to be 5.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. The unemployment rate has fallen by 0.7 percentage points from its recent peak in the December quarter 2001 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.1 per cent</span>. ", " All states experienced positive employment growth and a decline in their unemployment rates over 2002 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 10)</span>. Employment outcomes have been strongest in Queensland, with employment growing by 3.3 per cent over the year to the December quarter, and the unemployment rate in that state falling by one percentage point. A similar sized fall in unemployment rates was also recorded in Victoria and South Australia. In Tasmania unemployment persists at a significantly higher rate than in the rest of the country. ", " Industry trends in employment have been generally consistent with the pattern of output growth. Employment growth in the goods sector has remained buoyant over the past year, driven largely by increases in employment in the manufacturing, retail trade and construction sectors, though growth in construction employment has decelerated markedly over the past couple of quarters (Table 11). The largest contribution to employment growth over the past year was made by the property and business services sector, following a particularly sharp slowdown over 2001. Employment in industries exposed to tourism, such as transport and storage and accommodation, cafes and restaurants, has been very weak, though it appears to have turned around more recently. Reflecting the effects of the drought, agricultural employment fell by around 18 per cent over the year to the December quarter. Falling farm employment has been evident in most states, but has been most acute in northern and western NSW, where the drought is especially severe. ", " The pick-up in employment over 2002 has been associated with a slowing in the growth of labour productivity from the rapid pace recorded in 2001, though most measures of productivity remain around the trend growth rates observed over the 1990s. Over the year to the September quarter, output per person employed increased by 1.7 per cent. On an hours-worked basis, labour productivity rose by 2.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter, reflecting the continued decline in average hours (Graph 36). ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand have generally eased over the past few months, and suggest that in the near term, employment growth is likely to moderate from its current rapid pace. The ABS employer-based measure of vacancies fell by 3.5 per cent in the December quarter, but remains 10 per cent higher over the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 37)</span>. Measures of print-based vacancies have also slowed in recent months, though they are still above the levels of a year ago. The ANZ Bank series fell in the three months to January, but is 2½ per cent higher than the same time last year. The DEWR measure of skilled vacancies in the three months to January was 5½ per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. With the exception of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey, survey-based measures of employment intentions generally remain at levels consistent with above-trend employment growth. ", " The slow growth experienced by Australia's trading partners and the effects of the drought resulted in a much weaker than average export performance over 2002, with export growth close to zero through the year. Over the same period, the strength in domestic demand in the Australian economy was reflected in strong growth in imports. As a result of these developments, the trade deficit widened to around 3 per cent of GDP in the December quarter, compared with a deficit of about ½ per cent of GDP a year earlier. Assuming the net income deficit as a proportion of GDP remained constant in the December quarter, the current account deficit is likely to have reached around 5¾ per cent of GDP (Graph 38). ", " While the value of exports was broadly unchanged over 2002, it was around 6½ per cent lower than the peak in mid 2001 (Table 12). The weak global economy has contributed to falls in the prices of resource exports, and has also resulted in growth in the volume of manufactured exports being substantially lower than the average <span class=\"no-wrap\">over the 1990s</span>. The notable exception is exports of transport equipment, which rose by around 34 per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">over 2002</span>. Service exports have also been adversely affected by the global economy, as well as by the negative impact on international tourism arising from heightened concerns about safety. ", " More recently, there was a large drop in the value of resource exports in the December quarter, which primarily reflected lower volumes, particularly of crude oil and LNG, after some growth in the middle of 2002 from the oilfield development in the Timor Sea. However, the medium-term prospects for growth in natural gas exports are favourable. A major contract to supply LNG to China was awarded last August, in January another long-term contract was secured to supply LNG to Japan, and a preliminary agreement was reached to supply over <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 million tonnes</span> of LNG annually to Korea over seven years. ", " The drought continues to have a significant adverse impact on the economy in general (see ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2002/nov/1.html#box-a\">Box A: Economic Effects of the Drought</a>’ in the November 2002 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>) and on rural exports in particular, although a draw-down of stocks has helped to limit the scale of the fall in the value of rural exports to date. Over the year to the December quarter, the value of rural exports fell by 8 per cent, while the volume is estimated to have dropped by about 4 per cent. The falls were especially large for cereals, where the value exported declined by around 21½ per cent in the December quarter, to be about 34 per cent lower over the year. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) is forecasting a wheat crop in 2002/03 of just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 million tonnes</span>, a drop of almost 60 per cent from the previous year's crop. The sustained dry conditions have also limited water supplies available for irrigated crops, such as cotton and rice, and have resulted in smaller areas planted and lower yields on other winter and summer crops. ABARE's latest forecast implies a fall of 36 per cent in aggregate crop production in 2002/03. A number of agencies have indicated that current weather patterns are typical of an El Niño that breaks down in autumn, though weather patterns through February will be an important guide to the probability of that occurring. ", " Whereas the drought conditions have resulted in an immediate decline in crop production, meat production in the short run has been boosted, as farmers raised slaughter rates in response to the rising cost of feed. Consequently, the value of meat exports rose by around 8 per cent in the December quarter. Conversely though, once the drought breaks, crop production is expected to recover faster than meat output, owing to the need to rebuild stock numbers. Wool exports have also been affected by the drought, with export volumes around 3¼ per cent lower in the December quarter, as flocks continue to shrink. Notwithstanding the fall in volumes, the value of wool exports rose by about 11½ per cent, as the tight supply conditions have led to sharp increases in <span class=\"no-wrap\">wool prices (see the following section on commodity  prices)</span>. ", " Merchandise exports to many of Australia's markets declined through 2002 (Graph 39). The falls were especially steep in exports to the Middle East, following two years of double-digit growth. Exports to Japan have also been weak, reflecting the state of that economy. In contrast, the value of exports rose to those economies that have recorded stronger growth outcomes, with merchandise exports over 2002 up by more than 20 per cent to China, around 8 per cent to India and about 5¼ per cent to New Zealand. An exception to this general pattern is that exports to the EU rose sharply in the December quarter, to be 15 per cent higher over the year, despite weak domestic demand in the EU. ", " Continued robust growth in domestic final demand has underpinned further solid growth in imports. Over the year to the December quarter 2002, import volumes are estimated to have increased by around 16¼ per cent, with the growth in the value of imports somewhat lower, reflecting the decline in import prices. The strength in imports in 2002 was broadly based, with the increase in capital imports especially strong at 28½ per cent. Imports of civil aircraft have driven the increase in capital imports, with machinery and equipment imports also contributing significantly, reflecting the strong growth in business investment over the year. Over the year to the December quarter, growth in merchandise imports was broadly based, but was particularly strong from China and <span class=\"no-wrap\">Hong Kong (Table 13)</span>. ", " The net income deficit widened slightly in the September quarter, but expressed as a share of GDP remained around the level of recent years at 2.8 per cent. In the September quarter, the level of Australia's net foreign liabilities rose by 4.8 per cent, to be around 56 per cent of GDP, but remains close to its average over recent years <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 40)</span>. The increase primarily reflected the continuation of the recent trend of strong net debt inflows, raising net foreign debt to around 48 per cent of GDP. Net foreign equity liabilities also rose slightly, mainly as a result of valuation effects associated with the Australian share market outperforming equity markets abroad in local currency terms. The ratio of net income payments to exports, a measure of Australia's ability to service its liabilities, at 14 per cent, remains close to the lowest level of the past two decades. ", " In aggregate, commodity prices have risen modestly in recent months, with the RBA Commodity Price Index up by around 1 per cent in SDR terms in the three months to January, to be 1¼ per cent higher than a year ago <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 41)</span>. The recent increase was largely driven by higher base metals prices, with the largest price increases being for nickel, as stainless-steel production surged, and copper, in response to production cuts and strong demand from China. The differential between thermal and coking coal prices widened, as coking coal prices rose by 1¼ per cent in the three months to January, to be 2½ per cent lower than a year ago, while thermal coal prices fell by 5 per cent in the same period, to be almost 20 per cent lower over the year. Reflecting the escalating tensions in the Middle East and on the Korean peninsula, gold prices have risen by around 11 per cent in SDR terms since the beginning of November. As discussed in detail in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-economic-developments\">International Economic  Developments</a>’, oil prices have also risen rapidly in recent months. ", " Rural prices in aggregate rose sharply in the second half of 2002, though this masks divergent trends in specific commodities (Graph 42). Wool prices have continued to rise strongly in recent months, to be 57 per cent higher than a year ago – their highest level since June 1990. In contrast, and after rising significantly over the preceding five months, wheat prices have fallen by more than 20 per cent since October, partly in response to increased global supplies and reports of a favourable US wheat crop for the next harvest. Beef prices have continued to fall, as drought-induced slaughtering adds to supply and export demand remains relatively weak. ", " Official interest rates in Australia have remained unchanged since the last <em>Statement</em>, at 4.75 per cent. The last time rates were changed was in June, when they were raised by 25 basis points. Market yields on short-term securities have, however, generally drifted down over recent months (Graph 43). To a large extent, this seems to have reflected developments in US markets rather than domestic developments. Yields on 90-day bank bills have fallen from around 4.85 per cent in early November to around 4.80 per cent now. Yields on longer-term money market securities have fallen by more than those on shorter terms; for example, yields on 180-day bills fell from around 4.85 per cent to 4.70 per cent over the same period. The current structure of short-term rates in Australia suggests that markets are pricing in some probability of a cut in official interest rates over the next <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span> (Graph 44), though these expectations have fluctuated considerably, especially, as noted, in response to US news. ", " Yields on long-term bonds have shown a similar pattern to short-term rates. The yield on 10-year government bonds fell to the year's low of 5.15 per cent in late December before rising to around 5.45 per cent in mid January and then falling back to around 5.15 per cent. At this level, bond yields are around 45 basis points lower than their level of three months ago and 135 basis points below their peak level in 2002 (Graph 45). ", " While the run of domestic news, particularly the strong domestic employment outcomes for November and December, has tended to put upward pressure on bond yields, the flow of news from abroad has worked in the other direction. Another factor contributing to the rally in bond yields has been the high level of Australian dollar debt securities issued offshore, particularly in Japan. While the main impact of this issuance has been to reduce swap rates (since issuers use the swap market to hedge their Australian dollar interest obligations), downward pressure has also flowed through to government bond yields as market-makers in the swap market have in turn hedged some of their interest rate risk by buying government bonds. ", " The slope of the yield curve has flattened considerably since the beginning of 2002, with the cash rate being increased twice in the first half of the year and bond yields falling significantly over the period as a whole <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 46)</span>. While the spread between 10-year bond yields and the cash rate remains positive at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 basis points</span>, it is currently lower than its average over the past decade. Moreover, yields out to four years are at levels below the cash rate. The implications of these developments are discussed in the chapter ‘<a href=\"#assessment-of-financial-conditions\">Assessment of Financial Conditions</a>’. ", " The spread between 10-year bonds in Australia and the US has moved down noticeably from its peak of nearly 200 basis points in mid October (Graph 47) but remains considerably above its average over recent years. In part, the recent narrowing reflects a lessening of the high level of risk aversion which appeared to characterise the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US bond market</span> in mid October when 10-year yields in that country fell to four decade lows. The downward pressure on Australian yields arising from offshore bond issues has also played a role. ", " In contrast to the nominal yield spread, the spread between inflation-indexed bonds in Australia and the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United States</span> has widened since the previous <em>Statement</em>, reflecting the continuing run of good economic news in Australia and weak news in the US. Real long-term yields in the US are currently less than <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, which is more than 1½ percentage points below the level at the start of 2002. In contrast, real bond yields in Australia currently stand at around 3¼ per cent, down only slightly on levels a year ago. ", " Credit spreads on Australian corporate bonds have narrowed over recent months, reflecting the continuing solid performance of the Australian economy and a decline in spreads abroad (Graph 48). At current levels most spreads are slightly above levels at the beginning of 2002 but around their historical averages. The exception is for BBB-rated bonds for which spreads are lower than they were a year ago. Credit spreads in Australia for a given credit rating remain well below spreads in the US, although the differential has narrowed recently (Graph 49). ", " Australian equity prices have declined over recent months but have shown a smaller net fall than have US equity prices since the previous <em>Statement</em>. Over a longer period the Australian market has considerably outperformed its US counterpart, with the ASX 200 falling by 6 per cent over the past three years compared to a fall of <span class=\"no-wrap\">43 per cent</span> in the S&amp;P 500 (Graph 50). ", " The Australian equity market has been much less volatile than the US market. Over the past three months, the daily change in Australian equity prices has exceeded 1 per cent on 11 occasions, compared to 32 occasions in the US. The recent stability of the Australian market has led to expectations of low levels of volatility going forward. In particular, options prices suggest that the market sees a lower probability of a large decline in the ASX 200 than was the case in late October (Graph 51). At that time the market thought there was a 21 per cent chance of share prices falling by more than 10 per cent. The probability of such a fall is now put at 15 per cent. Options prices also suggest that the Australian market is expected to remain considerably less volatile than the US market over coming months. ", " The Australian price/earnings (P/E) ratio has declined over recent months due to both a decline in prices and an increase in reported earnings. At its current level of 23, the P/E ratio is around the average level since 1994 and below the US ratio, which has remained around 28 (Graph 52). Moreover, the Australian ratio is being held up by the large write-offs undertaken by News Corporation last year mainly as a result of its foreign operations; excluding News Corporation, the Australian P/E ratio is only 14, which is broadly in line with its long-run average. The relative levels of P/E ratios in Australia and the US suggest that domestic share valuations are more soundly based than those in the US. ", " Analysts expect earnings per share for ASX 200 companies to grow by around 10 per cent over 2002/03. This compares with an actual rise of 13 per cent over the last fiscal year and seems more achievable than the recent forecasts for US profits growth over the same period. ", " The performance of the various industry sectors since the last <em>Statement</em> has been mixed, though the majority of the sectors have recorded price falls since end October (Table 14). The materials and utilities sectors have been the strongest performers. Metals and mining companies in particular performed well, reflecting rises in commodity prices prompted in part by political tensions in the Middle East. There was no net change in the consumer discretionary sector index with a rise in News Corporation's share price (in response to a pick-up in US advertising) offsetting falls in the value of hotel, leisure and retailing companies. In contrast, the financial sector index was down 7 per cent, with banks down 9 per cent, largely reflecting the expected slowdown in housing lending and concerns about the profitability of the banks' funds management operations. The insurance (sub) index has also fallen – it is down 18 per cent since the last <em>Statement</em> – on continuing concerns about investment income and losses arising from bushfires. ", " Intermediaries' indicator variable interest rates have been unchanged for more than six months reflecting the constant target for the cash rate (Table 15). In contrast, banks' fixed rates for small business have fallen by around half a per cent since the previous <em>Statement</em>. This has followed the general decline in long-term market rates during the second half of 2002. Fixed rates on housing loans have declined only marginally since end October, but are about 40 basis points lower than levels six months ago. ", " Gross domestic issuance of non-government bonds remained strong in the December quarter, underpinned by record issuance of asset-backed securities (Graph 53 and Table 16). Issues of bonds by non-financial entities were steady, with a number of infrastructure providers and property trusts tapping the market. The bulk of bonds, however, were issued early in the quarter with the seasonal decline in December significantly more marked than has been the case in previous years. In part, this decline reflects the attractive pricing that a number of issuers have been able to obtain in offshore markets. There have also been signs that domestic investors have had their appetites temporarily sated for some types of bonds, particularly credit-wrapped bonds, with a number of issuers either postponing or reducing the size of their issues. There has been no non-resident issuance into the Australian market since July 2002. ", " Despite the high level of issuance in the quarter as a whole, the volume of non-government bonds outstanding has remained broadly unchanged, reflecting a relatively high level of maturities (Graph 54). Currently, the level of private sector bonds outstanding is $125 billion, which exceeds Commonwealth and state government bonds outstanding by $20 billion. ", " Offshore issuance of bonds by Australian entities was strong through the final quarter of 2002 (Graph 55) and showed no signs of slowing down in December. In total, $15 billion of new bonds were issued in the quarter, bringing the total for the year to $58 billion, up 30 per cent on the total for 2001. Financial institutions remain the largest borrowers, accounting for around 60 per cent of total offshore borrowing over the past few years. Moreover, financial institutions have relied increasingly on offshore markets, with around 90 per cent of all bonds issued by them in the second half of 2002 being issued offshore, compared with an average of 75 per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">since 1997</span>. In part this reflects the ability of financial institutions to react quickly to the favourable offshore funding opportunities that have arisen in recent times. Most offshore raisings are in foreign currency but with foreign exchange risk being offset by swaps back to Australian dollars. ", " As noted earlier, issuance of Australian dollar debt securities offshore, particularly in Japan, has been very strong. Uridashi issuance amounted to $4.2 billion in the December quarter, and reached a monthly record of $4.3 billion in January. ", " Issuance of hybrid securities (i.e. those that contain both debt and equity elements) has also been quite strong recently (Graph 56). Issuers have found these securities an attractive way of raising capital without diluting earnings per share. The relatively stable capital value and steady income stream offered by these securities has attracted strong investor interest, with recent issues being oversubscribed. ", " Equity raisings were relatively subdued during the December quarter, with $2.4 billion raised (Graph 57). Most issuance was in the form of placements and dividend reinvestments; initial public offerings totalled just $0.2 billion. Given recent trends in equity prices, investors have shown a preference for established companies rather than companies approaching the market for the first time. A total of $1.9 billion of initial public offerings was <span class=\"no-wrap\">made in 2002</span>, constituting only 15 per cent of net equity issuance, compared to an average of over 25 per cent <span class=\"no-wrap\">in the 1990s</span>. ", " Reflecting continued low borrowing interest rates, credit growth continues at a strong pace overall, though it has moderated slightly over the past three months (Graph 58). Total credit grew at an annualised rate of 7.9 per cent over the December quarter 2002, down from the 13.4 per cent annualised growth recorded in the previous quarter. A further pick-up in the growth of household borrowing was offset by a slowing in business credit. ", " Increased borrowing for housing remains the predominant driver of growth in household credit with borrowing for investment housing being particularly strong. The value of investor housing loan approvals has begun to moderate recently, consistent with other signs of an easing in housing market pressures, which in due course should result in a slowdown in the growth of investor housing credit. Personal credit rose at an annualised rate of 10.2 per cent over the six months to December 2002. ", " Growth in business credit, which had been increasing for much of 2002, slowed in the December quarter, reflecting reduced demand for credit from businesses in part because of a high level of internal funding resulting from continuing strong profit growth. As such, overall business funding levels remain quite high, suggesting that firms are still well placed to fund future investment. ", " On the other side of financial institutions' balance sheets, year-ended growth in the broader monetary aggregates has been relatively stable in recent months. Year-ended growth in broad money, at 9 per cent, is below growth in total credit, the difference reflecting the reduced reliance of financial institutions on funding sources that are included in broad money (Graph 59). ", " Margin lending for equities and managed funds has been flat for the past three months, in part reflecting the relatively weak performance of the equity market (Table 17). While the number of clients with margin loans increased slightly in the December quarter, this was offset by a small decline in the average loan size. The value of the security underlying margin debt has also changed little, as has the average gearing level. Margin calls were <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> lower in the December quarter than in the previous quarter, reflecting the fall in equity market volatility (Graph 60). ", " By most benchmarks, the level of short-term interest rates remains relatively low. The nominal cash rate was increased by a total of 50 basis points in May and June last year, and these increases were also reflected in the main variable borrowing rates of financial intermediaries. These policy adjustments removed some of the monetary stimulus then in place, but the cash rate remains below its recent medium-term averages, both in nominal and real terms, as have the indicator rates of financial intermediaries. At present, on a range of measures, real short-term interest rates are around ¼ to 1 percentage point below their averages over the past five years, and somewhat further below average if a 10-year reference period is used. Conclusions based on these historical benchmarks are necessarily imprecise, since they are partly dependent on the exact reference period chosen and also on the measure of inflation expectations used in the calculation. Nonetheless, it is clear from a range of alternative measures and time periods that short-term rates are moderately below the averages prevailing over the historically relevant recent period. ", " An alternative benchmark for assessing the policy stance is the slope of the yield curve, which can be broadly summarised by the difference between the cash rate and the yield on 10-year bonds. A strongly upward sloping yield curve would normally be considered to be characteristic of an expansionary policy setting, since it indicates that the cash rate is currently low relative to its expected level in the medium-term future. Conversely, a downward-sloping yield curve is indicative of contractionary monetary policy. As set out in the previous chapter, the slope of the Australian yield curve remains positive at present, but it has flattened considerably since the beginning of 2002. This has been partly a result of the increase in cash rates, but the yield curve has continued to flatten in the period when cash rates have been stable, as long-term bond yields declined. ", " The decline in bond yields has a number of implications for the assessment of the policy stance. Lower bond yields do impart some stimulus to the economy to the extent that they flow on to the interest rates paid by fixed-rate borrowers – for example fixed-rate mortgage borrowers or corporate bond issuers. But because bond yields embody expectations of future short-term rates, they also convey information about the market's assessment of where the cash rate will be in the future, which in turn will depend on expected economic performance. As noted in the chapter on ‘International Financial Markets’, the recent decline in bond yields has been a global phenomenon, and has reflected generally more pessimistic assessments about prospects for the major economies, with associated downward revisions to the expected path of policy interest rates. Australian bond yields have in fact declined by less than those in the major economies, but have not been immune from the general reassessment of prospects. The flatter yield curve now prevailing suggests that as a result, the market's assessment is that the cash rate is not as far below its expected medium-term path as had previously been the case. ", " In summary, then, the current level of interest rates is still relatively low when measured against recent historical benchmarks but, based on the movement in the yield curve, could be interpreted as less expansionary than before. The conclusion that financial conditions remain favourable to growth is supported by broader developments in credit markets. The relatively low level of interest rates charged by financial intermediaries has supported a strong pace of expansion of credit to households, particularly in the form of housing-related loans. While borrowing by businesses from intermediaries has been more subdued, there is no sign that business access to external finance is being constrained from the supply side. Aggregate external funding of businesses has remained at quite a good level throughout 2002, notwithstanding some easing of non-intermediated debt and equity raisings towards the end of the year. Narrowing credit spreads in recent months suggest that the availability of funding to businesses is not being hampered by concerns about credit quality. ", " In addition to these developments, movements in the exchange rate over recent months signal some reduction in the stimulus provided to the traded sector of the economy, though the level of the exchange rate remains on the low side of historical averages. The exchange rate appreciated during much of the second half of last year and rose further in January, both in trade-weighted terms and against the US dollar. In trade-weighted terms, which is the more relevant measure for assessing the impact on the traded sector, the recent movements in the exchange rate have, however, been relatively small. At present the TWI is around 3 per cent above its average <span class=\"no-wrap\">level in 2002</span>, but it remains below longer-run benchmarks such as its average over the past decade. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.7 per cent for the third consecutive quarter in December to be 3.0 per cent higher over the year (Table 18, Graph 61). The various measures of underlying inflation increased by between ½ and ¾ per cent in the quarter, and most measures suggest that underlying inflation is around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> in year-ended terms (Graph 62). The underlying inflation measure based on the CPI excluding volatile items is slightly higher, at 2.9 per cent, but it has eased from over 3½ per cent earlier in the year. The statistical measures of underlying inflation based on the distribution of year-ended rather than quarterly price changes are also slightly higher at around 2¾ per cent. Overall, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is currently around 2½ per cent. ", " The largest contributors to the increase in the CPI in the December quarter were a 2 per cent increase in fuel prices, which were around 8 per cent higher over the year, and a further large increase in vegetable prices, in part related to the effects of the drought. The drought also contributed to price rises for a number of other food items, including bread and cereal products, fruit and spreads. In year-ended terms, the most significant contributions to CPI inflation were made by petrol prices, the cost of overseas travel and accommodation (primarily reflecting a large increase earlier in the year) and house purchase costs, reflecting the high level of activity in that sector. Ongoing increases in the cost of insurance have also contributed to price rises in a number of items in the CPI. There were a few notable price falls. In particular, audio, visual &amp; computing equipment prices fell by 5 per cent in the quarter and by more than 10 per cent over the year. ", " The price increases in the quarter came from both external and domestic sources with tradable and non-tradable prices both increasing by 0.7 per cent in the quarter. However, over the past year, the rise in tradable prices has been lower than that of non-tradable prices, reflecting subdued world price pressures and relatively strong domestic conditions. There has also been a continued divergence in the rate of increase of goods prices, which increased by 1½ per cent over the year (excluding volatile items), compared with service prices which rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>. ", " Upstream inflationary pressures remained moderate in the December quarter, with the exception of higher oil prices, although the declines evident earlier in 2002 appear to have been reversed. Final-stage producer prices increased by 0.5 per cent in the quarter, and were 1.4 per cent higher over the year (Table 19, Graph 63). Construction prices continued to make the largest contribution to the rise in final-stage prices and underpinned the 0.9 per cent increase in domestic final-stage prices in the quarter. In contrast, the imported component of the final-stage price index fell by 0.9 per cent, reflecting further falls in the prices of electronic equipment and in part the appreciation of the exchange rate. ", " In the December quarter, prices at both the intermediate and preliminary stages of production increased at their fastest pace since June 2001, but remain well below the growth rates recorded at the end of 2000. Large positive contributions were made by price increases for agricultural products such as wheat, reflecting the effects of the drought, and petroleum. Excluding petroleum prices, the imported components of these series continued to fall. ", " The various business surveys indicate that upstream price pressures also remain moderate at present. The NAB survey reported that growth in purchase costs was unchanged at 0.4 per cent in the December quarter, and businesses expect a similar modest rise in the March quarter. The net balance of firms experiencing cost increases according to the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers has ticked up, having been on a downward trend for the past 18 months or so. ", " Consistent with the recent tightening in the labour market, signs have emerged that the wage cycle has passed its trough, although most labour cost indicators suggest that wage pressures remain generally moderate. In the September quarter, the wage cost index (WCI) for total pay increased by 0.9 per cent in quarterly seasonally adjusted terms, to be 3.3 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 64). At the industry level, the WCI recorded the fastest annual wage growth in mining (4.3 per cent), and the slowest in transport and storage (2.3 per cent) for the third consecutive quarter. ", " Business surveys also point to some pick-up in the pace of wage growth. Growth in the NAB survey measure of total labour costs picked up slightly over the year to December, and firms are expecting a similar pace in the next quarter. The NAB survey also reports that firms are having some difficulty in attracting suitable labour, although the ACCI-Westpac survey suggests that conditions are somewhat easier in the manufacturing sector. ", " Similarly, data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations indicate that new federal enterprise agreements ratified in the September quarter provided an average annualised wage increase of 4.1 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in the June quarter, although part of the increase reflects a shift in the industry composition of new agreements from lower-wage sectors to higher-wage sectors (particularly from retail trade to finance). Wage increases for the stock of existing agreements remained at 3.8 per cent in the September quarter. According to the latest Mercer <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em>, executives' base salaries rose by 4 per cent over the year to December, marking a somewhat slower pace than the 4½ to 5 per cent range that has existed over much of the past few years. ", " The various wage-bill measures continue to give divergent readings. (For a discussion of the interpretation of wage-bill measures, see ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2002/aug/1.html#box-b\">Box B: Measures of Labour Costs</a>’ in the August 2002 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.) Average weekly ordinary-time earnings of full-time adults (AWOTE) grew by 1.4 per cent in the September quarter, to be 4.9 per cent higher over the year. The national accounts measure of compensation per employee also grew by 1.4 per cent in the September quarter, but was 3.4 per cent higher over the year. On a per hour basis, compensation grew by 1.8 per cent in the September quarter, to be 4.1 per cent higher over the year, reflecting a decline in average hours worked. Reflecting strong productivity growth, unit labour costs rose by only 0.2 per cent in the September quarter, to be 2 per cent higher over the year. ", " Most measures of inflation expectations remain contained. The latest NAB quarterly survey reported that businesses expect inflation in retail and other final product prices to be 0.4 per cent in the March quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 65)</span>. Similarly, subdued expectations were reported in the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers. In contrast, consumer inflation expectations, as measured by the Melbourne Institute survey, picked up in the December quarter and remained at the same level in January. While this measure of expectations can be quite volatile, higher outcomes in recent months may reflect expectations of higher petrol prices associated with the risk of war in the Middle East, and higher food prices associated with the drought. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of investors, measured by the difference between 10-year bond yields and indexed bonds, declined to around 2¼ per cent over the second half of 2002, and have edged down over the March quarter to date. Financial market economists surveyed by the Bank have revised up their median inflation forecast for the year to June 2003, from 2.6 per cent to 2.8 per cent (Table 20). This partially reflects upward revisions to expected oil prices in the near term. For the year to June 2004, the median forecast fell marginally to 2.4 per cent. The median CPI inflation forecast of trade union officials, as surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training, has been revised down from 3.5 per cent to 3.3 per cent for the year to June 2003. The median forecast for the year to June 2004 has been revised up by ½ percentage point to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.0 per cent</span>. ", " As discussed in the introduction, inflation in underlying terms has passed the peak reached in 2001 and, in recent quarters, has been close to the middle of the target range. Over the year to the December quarter, underlying inflation was 2½ per cent, and the Bank's assessment is that it is likely to remain around that level during the next 18 months. This represents a slightly lower forecast than was presented in the previous <em>Statement</em>, principally reflecting the appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate that has taken place over the past few months. Following our normal practice, the forecasts assume that the exchange rate remains around recent levels, and international oil prices gradually return to the middle of the OPEC target range. ", " While the Australian economy continues to grow at a good pace, evidence of inflation pressures at present remains quite limited. The pace of upstream price increases eased during most of last year, before strengthening only modestly in the December quarter. Aggregate wage increases picked up slightly in the second half of 2002, but they remain at a pace consistent with the inflation target. While there have been isolated areas where strong demand has generated upward pressure on wages and prices, notably in the housing construction sector, these pressures have not spread across the economy more widely. Prospects at this stage are that inflation will remain contained. Given the weak international environment, the overall pace of growth of the Australian economy appears unlikely to generate significant capacity constraints in the period ahead. With the trade-weighted exchange rate now moderately higher than its average in 2002, and global inflation subdued, there is likely to be little if any inflationary pressure from import prices. ", " The CPI inflation rate, currently 3 per cent, is likely to remain higher than underlying measures in the short term. The difference between the CPI and underlying measures has reflected a number of sector-specific influences during the past year or so, including the effects of higher oil prices, insurance costs and airfares, as well as the impact of the drought on food prices. Some of these influences are now dissipating but others will continue to affect the CPI inflation rate for a few quarters. The full impact of the drought has not yet flowed through to final food prices; in addition, international oil prices have increased further from their average level in the December quarter, though this effect has been partly dampened by the stronger exchange rate. The impact of food and fuel prices is assumed to fade over the forecast horizon so that CPI inflation returns to around the underlying rate. ", " One risk to the inflation outlook is that these temporary influences may become incorporated into ongoing inflation expectations, and therefore begin to influence wage and price developments more widely. This risk would be amplified in the event that international oil prices were to rise significantly further. Another source of upside risk to inflation is the growth of domestic demand, which remains strong and could contribute to faster-than-expected growth in the economy overall. The main downside risk to growth and inflation is associated with the international outlook. The global economy is currently experiencing a period of weakness which, at this stage, is expected to be relatively short-lived. However, there is a significant risk that this recent weakening of conditions in the major economies will become more protracted, resulting in a less favourable environment for growth in Australia. In that scenario inflation in Australia would be lower than currently expected. At present these risks to the inflation outlook are judged to be evenly balanced. ", " There has been a substantial easing of both monetary and fiscal policy in the US over the past two years in response to the recent recession. Since the beginning of 2001, the Fed funds rate has been reduced by a total of 525 basis points (Graph A) and expansionary fiscal packages were enacted in 2001 and 2002, with a further package currently before the US Congress. In the case of fiscal policy, the easing was both earlier and larger than in previous recessions; in the case of monetary policy, the easing may not have started earlier, but the speed of the interest rate reductions was much faster than in the previous recession. ", " The easing in monetary policy commenced in January 2001, slightly ahead of the peak in economic activity, which the NBER dates as occurring in March 2001. This was not as early in the business cycle as it was in the early 1990s' recession, but the overall change in the stance of policy was more decisive on this occasion. Most of the easing in monetary policy in the current cycle occurred during 2001 and, by late 2001, the Fed funds rate was at its lowest level in 40 years. Following a pause of almost a year, the Fed eased by another 50 basis points late in 2002, which took the Fed funds rate to 1¼ per cent. ", " The change in the fiscal balance (an approximate measure of the boost to the economy from fiscal policy) from 2000 to 2002 has totalled nearly 4 per cent of GDP, as the balance has moved from a surplus of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.4 per cent</span> of GDP in 2000 to a deficit of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2002.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> According to the Congressional Budget Office, around half of this change in the fiscal balance has resulted from the automatic response of the budget to the weaker economy. Most of this was due to lower revenues as individual and corporate income taxes and capital gains tax receipts were all significantly lower in the past two years. The other half has resulted from discretionary measures taken by the Bush administration, primarily reflecting the 2001 tax cuts, the worker-assistance package in 2002 and the emergency assistance provided following the September 2001 terrorist attacks. In contrast to earlier downturns, the timing of the discretionary measures was not subject to significant lags; for example, tax rebates commenced relatively soon after the peak in the economy in March 2001. ", " In response to the continued uncertainty over the prospects for recovery, the Bush administration is proposing an additional fiscal package worth US$670 billion over the next 10 years, of which US$100 billion (1 per cent of GDP) is planned over the next 12 months. The package includes: continuing funding for the extension of unemployment benefits (which has already been enacted); bringing forward the reductions in income tax rates that were due to be implemented in 2004 and 2006, with these to take effect retroactively from 1 January this year; eliminating the double taxation of dividends; tripling the value of equipment investment that businesses can write off each year as expenses; and financing job retraining and support programs.

While this has been generally expected to be temporary in nature, concerns about the loss of momentum were for a time amplified by uncertainties related to the situation in Iraq. In particular there seemed a significant risk in the early months of the year that there would be a prolonged conflict and, consequently, a sustained period of high oil prices which might further hamper world growth. The relatively quick resolution of the conflict during April, and the associated decline in oil prices, has thus removed a significant risk factor for the global economy. ", " With these uncertainties now largely resolved, attention is again focused on the underlying prospects for growth in the major economies. At this stage, while modest growth appears to be continuing, there are few signs that the pace is picking up yet. The US economy, after quite a promising performance in the early phase of its recovery, slowed towards the end of last year and has broadly maintained this slower pace into 2003. The household sector has generally remained quite resilient through the recovery to date, and the economy is receiving considerable stimulus from monetary and fiscal policies. The main factor continuing to constrain growth is the condition of the business sector, where spending in the past couple of years has been dampened by low profitability and an overhang of capacity. While these imbalances are gradually being wound back, it is uncertain how long this process will take before generating the conditions for a sustained pick-up in business investment. ", " The performance of other parts of the world economy has remained disappointing in the recent period, though the non-Japan Asian region has been an important exception to this. In the euro area there has been only very modest growth over the past year. The Japanese economy had a better performance during much of 2002, largely as a result of strong export growth, but this does not appear to have been sustained. In contrast the <span class=\"no-wrap\">non-Japan</span> Asian region has generally performed strongly and, in particular, the two largest economies in the region, China and Korea, have continued to record a good pace of growth underpinned by domestic demand. Other economies in the region have also performed relatively well, though the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has had an effect in some economies, notably Hong Kong, Singapore and China. ", " Developments in international financial markets have broadly reflected the evolving prospects for the global economy. In recent months markets have been heavily influenced by the unfolding events in Iraq, as these prompted shifting assessments of the global economic risks. Sentiment deteriorated in the early months of the year as markets focused on the risks of a prolonged conflict, but there has subsequently been a noticeable improvement in sentiment as these concerns were resolved. As a result the declines in equity prices and in bond yields that occurred in the lead-up to the war have generally been reversed. Looking through these relatively short-lived movements, equity prices and bond yields have been broadly stable since late last year in most of the major markets, but they remain well below their levels of mid 2002. ", " Australian financial markets have been affected by many of the same factors influencing global markets and, as in other markets, equity prices and bond yields first fell then rose over the past couple of months. However, the overall movement in bond yields and equity prices over the past year has been noticeably smaller in Australia than in the US and in some other major countries. This is likely to have reflected the relative strength of the Australian economy and, consistent with that, smaller adjustments in market expectations about the future path of short-term interest rates. Another important development in recent months has been the appreciation of the Australian dollar. In trade-weighted terms this has brought the currency back to around its post-float average, after a number of years when it had been well below that level. ", " The Australian economy has continued to perform relatively well against the background of a difficult international environment. While growth declined to a 3 per cent pace during 2002, much of that slowing was attributable to the impact of the drought. Growth of the non-farm economy, which in these circumstances gives a better indication of the underlying trend, remained strong at almost 4 per cent during the year, though this pace is likely to have eased a little during the early part of 2003. The overall pace of non-farm growth has been sufficient to generate a decline in unemployment, bringing the unemployment rate to a level of just over 6 per cent in recent months. ", " A feature of Australia's growth performance in the recent period has been the sharply contrasting influences of domestic and external demand. With aggregate exports declining over the period since mid 2001, the external sector has acted as a significant drag on growth. This effect has been offset by an exceptionally rapid expansion in domestic demand. Total domestic demand expanded by 7 per cent during 2002, while private demand grew by almost 8 per cent, which was close to its fastest pace in the past two decades. One consequence of the combination of strong domestic demand and a weak external sector has been a substantial widening of the current account deficit over the past year. ", " The overall performance of the Australian economy has been underpinned by the strong condition of the business sector, which has largely avoided the imbalances that constrained growth in the US and other major economies in recent years. In particular, profitability of Australian businesses has remained high, and balance sheets are generally in sound shape with businesses in aggregate carrying relatively low levels of debt. In these circumstances businesses proved well placed to expand their investment spending over the past year from what had been a relatively low base. Indications are that the current upswing in business investment has some way yet to run. Business surveys suggest that further expansion in aggregate investment is planned over the next year or so, and there is a large volume of work outstanding in a range of resource and infrastructure projects which will continue to support growth in activity in the period ahead. While indicators of general business sentiment have eased in recent months, possibly reflecting temporary war-related concerns, they have generally remained at levels consistent with good growth of the economy. ", " Household spending also grew rapidly last year, with both consumption and housing investment contributing strongly to growth. There are signs of consumption slowing in the early part of 2003, though the extent of any slowing should be limited, given that consumer confidence remains high, while household incomes continue to be supported by rising employment and real wages. In the housing sector, forward indicators of building activity have been pointing to a downturn for some time now. This is expected to be fairly gradual, as activity is underpinned by a backlog of unfinished work and strong demand for renovations. ", " In contrast to the business sector, households have markedly increased their use of debt in recent years. This has been largely housing-related, though it appears also to have contributed to the funding of household consumption spending. Although loan approvals for housing have levelled out in the past few months, they remain at a high level consistent with housing-related credit growth of over 20 per cent, which will not be sustainable in the longer run. ", " Apart from the weak external conditions, the main factor holding back growth of the Australian economy in the recent period has been the effect of the drought. However, prospects for the rural sector have improved in recent months following widespread rainfall in February. While there have been some significant regional variations in the extent of follow-up rains, conditions are improving in a number of regions and current indications are that there should be a rebound in rural production in 2003/04. ", " Broader growth prospects for the Australian economy will depend both on the evolution of international conditions and on the extent to which domestic demand slows from its recent very rapid pace. The most likely scenario for the global economy involves a continued modest recovery, and hence a gradual lessening of the impact on Australia's export sector. At the same time, it would be surprising if the recent very rapid growth in domestic demand were to be maintained for long, and indeed it would not be desirable that demand should continue to outstrip the growth of the economy's productive capacity by such a large margin for an extended period. Indications are that there has been an easing in the pace of domestic demand so far in 2003 and that this is likely to continue in the near term. Hence the prospects are for a more balanced composition of growth emerging in the period ahead, with less reliance on domestic demand and a smaller drag from the external sector. This will probably entail some overall slowing in the non-farm economy in the near term, although the impact on GDP should be cushioned by the expected rebound in the farm sector. ", " Australia's inflation rate as measured by the CPI has gradually drifted upward in the recent period to reach an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the March quarter. Part of this movement has reflected temporary factors including sharp increases in petrol prices, driven by developments in international oil markets, and in vegetable prices, associated with the drought. Various underlying measures designed to abstract from extreme price movements are giving somewhat lower measures, and the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation has moved up to around 2¾ per cent. Hence there has been slightly more inflationary pressure than was envisaged at the time of the February <em>Statement</em>, when underlying inflation had been expected to remain stable at around 2½ per cent. ", " Looking forward, there are forces acting in both directions on underlying inflation though, on balance, inflation pressures appear likely to ease slightly in the period ahead. While there has been some pick-up in aggregate wage growth over the past year, as well as in other business costs, these pressures have at this stage remained quite modest. Inflation expectations remain relatively stable, and moderating demand pressures combined with the appreciation of the currency should have a dampening effect on costs and prices. Taking these influences into account, underlying inflation is expected to ease back to the middle of the target range over the remainder of this year and to remain at that level into 2004. If oil prices remain around current levels, petrol prices should reverse the bulk of their March quarter increase, which should bring the CPI more closely into line with underlying measures later this year. The risks around this inflation outlook are judged to be evenly balanced at present. ", " As discussed in detail in the main body of the <em>Statement</em>, financial conditions remain supportive of growth in spending and activity, with the general level of interest rates still close to historical lows. Households and businesses are clearly not constrained by the cost and availability of credit, and indeed credit to the household sector is continuing to grow rapidly. ", " In assessing the required stance of policy at its recent meetings, the Board has taken into account the shifting prospects for the global economy as well as the various other influences affecting the domestic growth and inflation outlook. Internationally, the Iraq situation appeared for a time to pose a significant downward risk to the global outlook, though this risk has since dissipated. Nonetheless the global environment remains a difficult one, and the expected improvement in export growth could be slow in coming. Domestically, while the recent CPI suggested slightly more inflation pressure than had been expected, inflation still seems likely to ease to around the middle of the target over the coming year. In these circumstances the Board judged that it would be prudent to maintain the current moderately expansionary setting, and hence has left the cash rate unchanged, pending further reassessment of economic developments in Australia and abroad. ", " In its latest assessment of the world economic outlook, released in early April, the IMF lowered its forecast for growth in the G7 countries in 2003 by around half a percentage point to 1.7 per cent, around the same <span class=\"no-wrap\">rate as in 2002 (Table 1)</span>. However, most of this revision reflected weaker outcomes to date, rather than a poorer outlook. Conditions are still expected to improve from the second half of this year, with growth returning to its long-run average in 2004. Nonetheless, the balance of risks is considered to be on the downside, with much depending on the US economy regaining momentum despite the persistence of constraints on spending resulting from past over-investment and falls in equity markets. The IMF forecasts were based on an assumption of oil prices being somewhat above current levels and a more protracted conflict in Iraq. The IMF has subsequently noted that the dissipation of these risks would boost world growth in 2003. ", " Oil prices have been especially volatile in recent months, peaking at almost US$38 per barrel in early March, before falling to below US$28 per barrel a couple of weeks later (Graph 1). The increase in oil prices in the first part of the year was mainly the result of escalating tensions in Iraq, although disruptions to Venezuelan and Nigerian supply, and increased demand for oil in the US owing to an unusually cold winter, added to the upward pressure on prices. ", " The sharp fall in prices in mid March occurred just before the start of military action in Iraq. The relatively low level of prices since then reflects a combination of limited damage to Iraq's oil-production infrastructure, the resumption of production in Venezuela to near pre-strike levels and milder weather in the US. Moreover, Saudi Arabia has increased production recently, to some extent offsetting the pause in Iraqi oil exports. In late April, OPEC members announced increased quotas and smaller-than-expected cuts in production, effective 1 June, resulting in a further fall in prices. Box A on ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Global Oil Supply                          and Capacity</a>’ provides more information on the current and longer-term supply-demand balance in the world oil market. ", " The US economy has yet to show signs of a sustained pick-up in activity following the loss of momentum towards the end of last year. GDP recorded an increase of 0.4 per cent in the March quarter to be 2.1 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 2). In the quarter, there was strong growth of residential construction but consumption growth remained weak and business investment fell (Table 2). Both exports and imports declined in the quarter. The trade deficit, expressed as a ratio to GDP, was unchanged at 4.5 per cent. ", " The weakness in household consumption growth during the March quarter was consistent with some weakening in the labour market. Employment has fallen in recent months, with the unemployment rate rising back to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> in April, although there was a pick-up in growth in the employment cost index in the March quarter. The sharp rise in oil prices is also likely to have constrained spending for much of the quarter, while the uncertainty surrounding the war in Iraq affected sentiment, which fell to its lowest level in nine years in March before rising sharply in April (Graph 3). ", " Residential building activity, on the other hand, has continued to be boosted by historically low mortgage interest rates and increasing house prices. Leading indicators such as housing starts and permits remain at high levels, despite a fall in permits of late, suggesting growth in this sector should be sustained in coming quarters. Mortgage refinancing activity was also very strong in the quarter, reaching a new high in early March. Some of this refinancing has helped support consumption. ", " Manufacturing output has continued to fall in 2003 and, despite rising through the first half of 2002, is now <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> lower than in mid 2000 (Graph 4). Capacity utilisation in March was at its lowest level since 1983. Sentiment, as recorded by the ISM survey, more than retraced the increases recorded in late 2002 to be at its lowest level for over a year, suggesting there may be further weakness in manufacturing output in the near term. Business investment declined in the March quarter with expenditure on equipment falling, after having picked up a little through most of 2002, and expenditure on structures falling further. One positive sign is that new orders of capital goods (excluding defence and aircraft) picked up. ", " The discretionary fiscal stimulus for 2003 as a whole is likely to be a little larger than expected several months ago. Congress may reject certain measures included in the fiscal package announced in January but has approved a request from President Bush for US$79 billion (¾ of a percentage point of GDP), mostly to fund operations in Iraq. ", " Largely because of the rise in energy costs, consumer price inflation has increased further in the past few months, to 3 per cent over the year to March. However, the core measure of inflation has edged down to 1¾ per cent, with core services inflation moderating a little to be just over 3 per cent over the year to March and core goods prices continuing to fall by around 1½ per cent in year-ended terms. ", " It is unclear whether the growth recorded in Japanese GDP over 2002 has been sustained. Exports, while volatile month to month, have been essentially unchanged since the middle of 2002, with stronger exports to Asia, particularly exports of machinery and equipment to China, recently offset by weaker exports to the US. Consistent with the flat trend in exports, industrial production has gained little ground in the past nine months or so, after picking up in the first half of 2002 (Graph 5). There are, however, some signs of modest improvement in other indicators of manufacturing sector activity: machinery orders data have been stronger in recent months; operating profits increased solidly over the year to the December quarter; and business sentiment, as reported in the Tankan survey, has improved further. In contrast, the non-manufacturing components of these measures have shown little improvement over the past year, consistent with the Tertiary Activity Index, which has remained broadly unchanged. ", " The labour market also has remained weak. Despite increasing in the past couple of months, employment has been broadly unchanged over the past year, with increases in services employment largely offset by declines in the manufacturing sector. The unemployment rate has been between 5¼ and 5½ per cent for most of the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 months</span>. On a somewhat brighter note, and consistent with some of the partial indicators for manufacturing noted above, there has been a substantial improvement in manufacturing hours worked, overtime paid and bonuses over the past year. ", " The Japanese economy continues to experience deflation. Reflecting higher prices for fresh food and petroleum products, the CPI fell by only 0.1 per cent over the year to March, compared with a fall of 1 per cent over the previous year. Excluding these items, inflation has remained around −¾ per cent in year-ended terms. ", " The economies of non-Japan Asia on the whole have continued to perform well, with the two largest economies, China and Korea, recording particularly strong growth (Table 3). The strength in China and Korea has been supported by domestic demand as well as exports, with demand in China in particular helping to boost exports from other east-Asian countries. Capital spending has been solid in China and picked up again in Korea, following some construction-induced weakness in the middle of last year. Korean household consumption, which had been boosted by rapid growth in house prices and indebtedness, appears to have moderated in the new year following a government-directed tightening in lending criteria late last year. ", " There have been some differences in performance in other parts of the region, largely reflecting differences in trade performance. In particular, growth in Indonesia has slowed following a sharp fall in tourism in the aftermath of the Bali bomb attacks, while the strength of output in Hong Kong in the second half of 2002 was driven by a large pick-up in tourism and other trade-related services. While more recent data suggest industrial production and merchandise exports have continued to hold up in aggregate (Graph 6), the recent outbreak of SARS is likely to dampen activity, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore, both of which have responded with fiscal measures, and has affected travel and confidence more generally across the region. While China has experienced the largest number of SARS cases, tourism and other service industries account for a smaller share of China's economy than elsewhere in the region. ", " Despite higher oil prices, consumer price inflation in most of the region's countries has eased in recent months and prices continue to decline in Hong Kong. In contrast, year-ended inflation has returned to positive territory in China and, abstracting from food and energy prices, has remained around 3 per cent in Korea. ", " In New Zealand, output recorded another strong increase in the December quarter, to be 4.5 per cent higher than a year earlier. Private consumption and business investment rose strongly in the quarter, partly offset by a large increase in imports. Although the labour market remains tight, with the unemployment rate around record lows, year-ended inflation fell to 2.5 per cent in the March quarter, after being around the top of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's target of 1–3 per cent for about a year. Citing a more recent slowing in growth and an easing in inflationary pressures, the central bank cut its key policy rate by 25 basis points in late April. ", " There has been little growth in the euro area economy since mid 2002. GDP expanded only slightly in the December quarter, with output in the services sector rising modestly and output in the manufacturing and construction sectors falling. More recently, industrial production has remained flat and business confidence has fallen further (Graph 7). Weakness has been particularly apparent in Germany, with the IFO measure of industrial confidence weaker than sentiment indicators in other countries, while the construction sector has continued its protracted downward trend. ", " Euro area household consumption continued to expand in the December quarter, with retail trade holding up fairly well in the new year, despite a deterioration in the labour market. The euro area unemployment rate rose to <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.7 per cent</span> in March. Employment continues to fall in Germany and to record little growth in France and Italy. Consumer confidence has also fallen further, to be around nine-year lows. ", " Euro area inflation was only slightly above the ECB's reference rate, at 2.1 per cent over the year to April, and core inflation has fallen a little further (Graph 8). The easing in underlying inflationary pressures, associated with continued weakness in activity, combined with downward revisions of its forecasts for euro area growth, led the ECB to cut its key policy rate by 25 basis points to 2½ per cent in March. On the fiscal front, the European Commission has begun the ‘excessive deficit’ procedure for France, after its 2002 budget deficit exceeded the <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> of GDP ceiling prescribed by the Stability and Growth Pact. However, France has stated its intention to proceed with planned tax cuts rather than commit to bringing the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP within two years. ", " Conditions in the United Kingdom remain a little stronger than elsewhere in Europe despite growth slowing further in the first quarter of 2003. Services sector output weakened, following several years of solid expansion, and industrial output remained subdued. Despite a strong labour market – the unemployment rate is around historic lows – and increased household borrowing against rising house values, retail sales rose by only 0.1 per cent in the quarter. ", " Although year-ended inflation (excluding mortgage costs) has remained around the top of the Bank of England's target range, forecasts for a weaker outlook and lower inflation prompted the Bank of England to reduce its policy rate by 25 basis points in February to 3¾ per cent. The fiscal deficit is expected to remain around 2½ per cent of GDP this year before decreasing by around ¼ of a percentage point next year. ", " Developments in international financial markets during the past three months mainly reflected the ebb and flow of news about Iraq. Early in the period, markets exhibited increased risk aversion as international tension grew. Key elements included a switch from equity investments to bonds, a move out of US dollars, particularly into currencies such as the Swiss franc which have a ‘safe haven’ reputation, and speculative buying of gold and oil. One important consideration weighing on markets was the likelihood that the sharp increase in oil prices had significantly increased the downside risks to economic growth. These trends gathered momentum through February and into March. By mid March, however, sentiment had swung to the view that the impending war would be over relatively quickly and these trends were sharply reversed. ", " Markets paid less attention than usual to economic data through this period, though once the war was over the general assessment seemed to be that the data in the major regions of the world, with the possible exception of non-Japan Asia, had mostly been disappointing. As such, even though markets are no longer exhibiting the extreme pessimism seen in early March, they do not as yet show much conviction that a pick-up in world economic growth is occurring. Abstracting from the volatility during the periods of heightened uncertainty, bond yields and share prices in most industrial countries have been on a generally flat trend over the past six or so months and remain lower than their levels of a year ago. ", " The economic noise generated by the events of recent months has made it more difficult to read the underlying economic trends. The US Fed has responded to this by keeping its policy rate unchanged at 1.25 per cent. This is the lowest level since the early 1960s. While the Fed did not present a policy bias following the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in March, saying that it could not usefully characterise the balance of risks, markets expect the Fed to ease monetary policy again. The Fed funds futures market is currently pricing in a <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis point</span> easing in the second half of the year (Graph 9). ", " In Europe, where signs of economic weakness have recently been more pronounced than in the US, a number of European central banks have eased monetary policy (Graph 10, Table 4). The European Central Bank in March cut rates by a further 25 basis points to 2½ per cent, a level which, apart from a brief period in 1999, is the lowest in the post-World War II period. Market participants expect a further easing in coming months, with futures markets pricing in a 25 basis point cut by June. ", " In the UK, the Bank of England surprised financial markets in February when it cut its policy rate by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.75 per cent</span>. Since then it has kept rates on hold, although futures markets continue to price in a further 25 basis points of easing by June. The policy rate in the UK is now at its lowest level <span class=\"no-wrap\">since the late 1950s</span>. ", " The central banks of Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark have also eased monetary policy in recent months. Concern about the growth outlook for the world economy, and particularly the euro area, was cited as a major reason for the reductions, though in the case of the Swiss central bank, the strength of the Swiss franc was also an important factor. ", " The Reserve Bank of New Zealand reduced its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 per cent in April. ", " In Japan, the central bank has maintained the cash rate at zero and has announced further measures to try to stimulate monetary expansion. These include an increase in the amount of share purchases it intends to undertake from banks, from JPY2 trillion to JPY3 trillion, and the planned purchase of asset-backed securities. Also, the target range for bank reserves was increased further in April. ", " The only industrial country increasing interest rates is Canada. The Bank of Canada raised its policy interest rate by a further 50 basis points to 3.25 per cent in two steps over March and April, citing persistent above-target inflation and strong final domestic demand. These follow tightenings totalling 75 points in 2002. After the US, Canada had undertaken the largest easings during 2001, which had left it with an unusually low level of interest rates. The subsequent tightenings have reversed only part of the earlier easing. ", " Interest rates have been broadly stable at low levels in Asian emerging markets. The exception was Indonesia, which lowered rates by a total of just over one percentage point, to 11 per cent, reflecting lower inflation outcomes in recent months. In Latin America, official interest rates have generally remained unchanged. ", " The Iraq war was the main influence on bond yields in most industrial countries over the past three months. As noted, the build-up to the war saw rising risk aversion in financial markets, resulting in increased demand for government bonds which caused their yields to fall (Graph 11). Once it became clear that the war was likely to be over quickly, bond yields rose again. ", " While most countries experienced this cycle in bond yields, its severity varied. In the US, yields on US 10-year government debt fell by around 40 basis points in the run-up to the war, to a 45 year low of 3.56 per cent. All this move has since been reversed and yields are now much the same as they were early in 2003. This remains a low level by historical standards. ", " In Europe, the cycle in bond yields caused by the war was less pronounced than in the US, but overlaid on this has been a downward trend in yields as disappointment about economic growth in Europe has been more marked than in the US. Bond yields in Europe are now 40 basis points lower than they were six months ago, though they are still above comparable yields in the US. ", " Japanese bond yields experienced very little ‘war’ impact and the dominant influence seemed to be pessimism about the Japanese economy and the Japanese share market. Even though yields were already at unprecedented lows at the start of the year, they have since fallen noticeably further. Ten-year yields are currently 0.6 per cent, down from 1.0 per cent six months ago and 1.4 per cent a year ago. ", " Spreads on US corporate debt to US Treasuries have continued to narrow over recent months (Graph 12). The easing was noticeable across all credit ratings with ‘junk’ bond spreads falling by 140 basis points over the past three months, and AAA spreads narrowing by 40 basis points. Spreads had risen to very high levels in the second half of 2002 due to the extreme uncertainty associated with a number of high profile corporate collapses in the US. This has now been fully reversed. ", " Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt have narrowed by around 150 basis points over the past three months, reflecting continued improvement in perceptions of sovereign risk in both Latin America and emerging Europe (Graph 13). In particular, Brazilian spreads have fallen by 500 basis points to around 10½ per cent. Spreads on Asian emerging market sovereign debt, which are at much lower levels than in other emerging markets, showed little net change. ", " The pattern in equity markets was fairly consistent with that in bond markets, again reflecting the importance of war news. Broad measures of US share prices fell by 6½ per cent over February and early March, but have since rebounded strongly to be 5 per cent higher than at the start of the year (Graph 14). US corporates have generally announced stronger-than-expected March quarter earnings, which has helped to support the share market in recent weeks. On the other hand, the underfunding of company pension schemes remains a major issue which still needs to be resolved and could be a significant drag on profits in the period ahead. Also, the US financial accounts data show that over the past two years the non-financial corporate sector has been paying out more in dividends than it has earned in profits, reducing internal funds which would otherwise have been available for investment (Graph 15). ", " European equity markets have also taken their lead from events in Iraq recently, though they have generally underperformed the US market (Table 5). Since the middle of 2002, the Euro STOXX and UK S&amp;P indices have fallen by 23 and 15 per cent respectively, compared with a fall of 6 per cent for the US S&amp;P 500. The major driver of this underperformance has been the financial sector, with the Euro STOXX and UK S&amp;P financial sub-indices falling by 26 and 18 per cent respectively since June 2002, compared with a fall of 6 per cent in the comparable sub-index for the US. Within the financial sector the insurance sector has performed particularly poorly in Europe. This mainly reflects the high proportion of investments held in equities by insurance companies in the euro area and the UK, as well as the proliferation of life insurance policies with guaranteed returns. More generally, insurance companies worldwide have experienced large losses associated with an increase in asbestosis claims and claims associated with directors' liabilities. During the second half of the 1990s some of the credit risk on bank balance sheets was also transferred to insurance companies (mainly via credit derivatives). A longer-term perspective on international equity markets is given in <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>. ", " Japanese equity prices were relatively unaffected by global events. While the broad-based Japanese indices fell over February and early March, they did not benefit from the rebound seen in the other major markets over the second half of March. Indeed the Topix index fell to a 19-year low in April. The declines resulted in a range of official proposals being mooted to support stocks, although the proposals are yet to be finalised. The Bank of Japan continued its stock purchase program from banks, and by late April had purchased around JPY1.2 trillion in shares. As noted previously, the ceiling on total stock purchases was raised to JPY3 trillion from JPY2 trillion in March. ", " Asian equity markets have generally fallen since the end of January owing first to uncertainty about the world economic outlook and more recently to fears regarding the economic impact of the SARS virus. The largest declines were experienced in Taiwan (16 per cent), China (7 per cent) and Malaysia (5 per cent). In contrast to Asia, Latin American markets rose by between 10 and 20 per cent over the past three months, with the exception of Venezuela which remains affected by political turmoil. ", " The build-up to war added to the move out of US dollars and the trade-weighted value of the US dollar fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> over February into early March, reaching a new three-year low (Graphs 16 and 17). There was a brief respite when it became clear that the coalition forces would achieve a quick and decisive victory, but by mid April the market was again selling the dollar. In trend terms, the US dollar has moved sideways against the Japanese yen over much of the past year, but against the euro it has fallen by about 24 per cent since early 2002. ", " Other European currencies have generally also risen against the US dollar, particularly the Swiss franc which experienced strong ‘safe haven’ demand for a time. The UK pound has largely gone down with the US dollar recently, the downward move being particularly pronounced after the Bank of England surprised markets with a rate cut in February. ", " Asian currencies were broadly steady against the US dollar over recent months, maintaining the sideways trend which has prevailed since early 2001. Latin American currencies generally appreciated against the US dollar, with the Argentinean and Brazilian currencies rising by nearly 20 per cent. Following a 30 per cent fall in the currency over January, Venezuela fixed the bolivar against the US dollar. ", " The Australian dollar has continued to recover in recent months from the unusually low levels to which it <span class=\"no-wrap\">fell in 2001</span>. At the end of that year, the exchange rate against the US dollar was around US51 cents. By the <span class=\"no-wrap\">end of 2002</span>, it had risen to about US56 cents; and in 2003 to date it has risen to over US63 cents. ", " Just as the unusually low exchange rate against the US dollar in 2001 was to a large degree a reflection of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar's</span> strength at that time, the subsequent rise of the Australian dollar has in large part reflected the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar's</span> fall over the past year or so. For example, even though the Australian dollar has risen by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> against the US dollar since the end of 2001, it has fallen against most European currencies over the same period – the notable exception being the British pound. Accordingly, the trade-weighted index of the Australian dollar has risen less than the rate against the US dollar (Graph 18). The increase nonetheless has been substantial, partly because the Asian currencies, which have quite a high weight in the index, have slipped against the Australian dollar over the past year or so, as they tend to follow (or be directly linked to) the US dollar. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Since the end of 2001</span>, the TWI is up by about 13 per cent, of which about <span class=\"no-wrap\">10  per cent</span> has occurred in 2003 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 19)</span>. Despite this rise, the current level of the TWI is only broadly in line with its post-float average. The exchange rate against the US dollar, of course, remains well below its long-run average. ", " As in the case of equity and bond markets, there has been some volatility in the foreign exchange market in recent months due to the war. The Australian dollar rose strongly in late February and early March as part of a general move away from the US dollar, but this was reversed in mid March as the US dollar recovered. Since then, the downward trend in the US dollar and the upward trend in the Australian dollar have resumed. <span class=\"no-wrap\">The Australian</span> dollar's exchange rate against the euro has remained in a tight range through most of 2003, around 0.56 euros. ", " One of the factors supporting the Australian dollar has been strong overseas demand for Australian dollar bonds, particularly by Japanese retail investors. This overseas demand reflects relatively attractive interest rates and, related to that, a stable and well-performing economy. Australian dollar eurobond issuance averaged $4.4 billion a month in the first four months of this year, compared with a monthly average of just under $2 billion in 2002 and less than $1 billion in earlier years. Uridashi issuance, which refers to bonds issued into the Japanese retail market, has accounted for much of the increased interest although market participants report robust demand for Australian dollar denominated debt from investors in Europe and <span class=\"no-wrap\">non-Japan Asia</span>. (See chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’ for more detail on bond issuance.) ", " Another supportive factor has been an upgrade of Australia's foreign currency debt ratings to AAA by Standard and Poor's in February. Australia now has a AAA rating from both Moody's and S&amp;P (Moody's lifted its rating for Australia to AAA in October last year). Fitch also raised its sovereign foreign currency rating for Australia in February, though only from AA to AA+. The upgrades reflect Australia's sound financial position, including its strong public finances and an absence of foreign currency exposure on external finances, as foreign debt is largely hedged to Australian dollars. ", " The RBA continued to rebuild its foreign currency reserves by making market purchases over the past few months which more than covered the Government's requirements. In the three months to April, net purchases amounted to around $480 million, while earnings on foreign reserves added some $360 million. Valuation effects, however, reduced reserves by $990 million. Current net reserves stand at around $12 billion, up $4 billion from a year ago. The Bank also made substantial use of foreign exchange swaps during the past few months to manage domestic liquidity. The swap position has fluctuated in a $5 billion range in 2003, though in net terms it has shown little change, and currently stands at around $26 billion. Total reserve holdings (i.e. reserves held outright plus reserves held under swap agreements) currently total $37 billion. ", " The latest national accounts show that real GDP rose by 0.4 per cent in the December quarter, to be 3 per cent higher over 2002 (Table 6). While the pace of growth slowed from rates seen earlier in the year, this largely reflected developments in the farm sector, with the drought directly subtracting 0.9 percentage points from growth over 2002. Overall, activity continued to be underpinned by strength in domestic demand, which posted a rapid 7 per cent gain over 2002. This strength remained broad-based; while consumption growth eased in the latter stages of 2002, the upswing in business investment gathered pace and housing activity remained strong. ", " Rapid growth in domestic demand, particularly the import-sensitive machinery and equipment component of investment, underpinned a marked increase in imports. In contrast, export volumes remain constrained by subdued global conditions and drought-induced weakness in rural exports. As a result, net exports subtracted <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.3 percentage points</span> from GDP growth over 2002 (Graph 20). ", " Domestic demand is expected to slow from the rapid pace recorded in 2002 to a more sustainable growth rate during 2003. Forward indicators suggest that dwelling investment has peaked, but at this stage the downturn in this sector is expected to be mild compared with previous cycles. Growth in consumption is expected to be supported by continued employment growth and the recent easing in oil prices. Strength in business investment should continue in the period ahead, with capital expenditure intentions and the amount of work in the pipeline suggesting that the recovery in investment has further to run. However, the effect of the drought will continue to be felt in the next few quarters, with a further fall in farm production projected to reduce GDP by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.4 percentage points</span> in the first half of 2003. ", " Household consumption grew by 4.1 per cent over the course of 2002, with the very rapid growth in the first half slowing to a more sustainable pace in the second half. Recent indicators suggest that this more moderate pace of consumption growth has continued into the first few months of 2003 (Graph 21). The volume of retail sales, which accounts for more than a third of household consumption, decreased by 0.2 per cent in the March quarter. The easing in growth has been particularly marked in recreational and household goods; the latter suggests that the impetus from buoyant levels of housing activity may be waning. However, motor vehicle sales, which are not included in the retail figures, increased strongly in the quarter. ", " The outlook for consumption remains favourable. Higher wages and strong employment growth have been partly offset by the effects of the drought on farm incomes. Lower farm incomes are likely to persist into mid 2003, despite the easing in drought conditions. Consumer sentiment has been volatile in the past few months, reflecting consumer reactions to events in Iraq and movements in petrol prices, but has returned to above its long-run average. Growth in consumption also continues to be supported by increases in household borrowing and wealth. ", " The fast pace of household debt accumulation has continued into 2003, increasing by 19½ per cent in annualised terms over the three months to March. The increase in housing-related debt has exceeded net new spending on housing assets, implying that households are continuing to draw on their accumulated equity in the housing stock. The rate of housing equity withdrawal in the December quarter remained at its high level of recent quarters.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " The value of household assets has continued to grow strongly, increasing by 15 per cent over the year to the December quarter (Table 7). Most of the growth is explained by strong increases in dwelling prices. The value of household financial assets increased slightly in the December quarter, but remained around 3 per cent lower over the year, mainly reflecting the decline in equity markets. The strong growth in dwelling prices has also meant that a measure of household gearing – the ratio of debt to assets – was roughly unchanged over the year, at close to 15 per cent. ", " The increases in interest rates in the first half of 2002 and rising level of household debt have raised households' debt-servicing requirements (Graph 22). In the December quarter 2002, households' gross interest payments are estimated to have reached 7½ per cent of household disposable income, close to the highs over the past decade. Some aspects of the measurement of aggregate interest payments are discussed in more detail in <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>. ", " The upturn in the housing sector continued in the December quarter, with dwelling investment rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.2 per cent</span> in the quarter to be 21 per cent higher over the course of 2002. Construction of new dwellings rose by 28 per cent over the year, while expenditure on alterations and additions was 11 per cent higher. Looking ahead, some easing in housing activity is expected given the downturn in a range of leading indicators, but at this stage the downturn is likely to be smaller than in previous cycles. The large amount of medium-density construction work in the pipeline and ongoing growth in renovation activity should support building activity in the period ahead. ", " Building approvals for detached houses have been on a downward trend for the past year and a half, and the number of commencements declined in the December quarter (Graph 23). However, builders report that commitments to construct new houses, while down from their recent peak, remain at high levels. The number of loan approvals to owner-occupiers for new construction has risen in recent months although it remains well below its peak. ", " Building approvals in the multi-unit sector, where investor interest predominates, have been at a high level. A large number of apartments remain under construction or committed for construction in the near future. The amount of work yet to be done has risen sharply and, for the first time, significantly exceeds that for detached housing. However, there is anecdotal evidence of a slowing in investor demand in the apartment market and the value of housing loan approvals to investors has levelled out in recent months. Oversupply in the rental market is likely to further dampen investor activity. Rents have been declining in real terms and vacancy rates remain around historically high levels. In recent months there has also been a significant reduction in the number of units planned, particularly in the inner-city apartment markets in Melbourne and Brisbane. ", " Ongoing growth in renovation activity, boosted by rising dwelling prices and land supply shortages in some cities, may partly offset any decline in new dwelling investment in the period ahead. Expenditure on alterations and additions now accounts for around 40 per cent of overall dwelling investment. Loan approvals for alterations and additions have risen in recent months, and the value of building approvals for this purpose has increased to be more than 10 per cent higher in the March quarter compared with a year earlier. ", " Other indicators of activity in residential property markets are consistent with some easing in demand pressures. The value of total loan approvals to owner-occupiers, which includes loans for the purchase of existing dwellings, has broadly levelled out over the past year and a half; as noted above, a similar, although much more recent, pattern is apparent in loan approvals to investors (Graph 24). Auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne so far this year have remained below their averages of the first half of 2002. The number of properties being offered for auction has also declined, with the number of properties sold at auction around 20 per cent lower in the first four months of 2003 than a year earlier. Credit extended for housing has continued to grow quite strongly however, largely reflecting the earlier rapid growth in the value of loan approvals. ", " According to most measures, house prices continued to rise strongly in the December quarter 2002, extending the large gains of the previous two years. Within the national average, there was some variation across cities, with price growth in Melbourne clearly slowing in the second half of 2002. More recent indicators have been mixed. Data from the Commonwealth Bank suggest that house prices continued to rise rapidly across mainland Australia over the year to the March quarter, though they declined in Sydney and Canberra in the latest quarter. Unit prices fell in the March quarter, entirely reflecting a sharp fall in Melbourne, but this followed a very sharp rise in the previous quarter, and year-ended growth in unit prices remained strong overall. Preliminary data on repeat dwelling sales from Residex, which attempt to abstract from compositional change in the stock of dwellings sold, indicate little change on average in prices for houses and units in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in the March quarter, though these data can be subject to significant revision. ", " Rapid growth in domestic demand underpinned rising production in most non-farm industries over 2002. Year-ended growth in the goods sector has eased, but remains robust, particularly in the construction sector and related manufacturing industries (Graph 25). Conditions in the services sector remain subdued, reflecting soft discretionary demand for business services from other firms. Output growth in the household services sector has increased slightly from its recent trough, but external factors may compound the weakness in the overall services sector in the near term. These factors include the constraints imposed by weaker world growth on the budgets of foreign-owned firms, and the effects on tourism services of concerns over the conflict in Iraq and the spread of SARS. The drought has resulted in agricultural production falling by more than one-quarter over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span>, and has had an adverse effect on industries exposed to agriculture. ABS projections, based on the most recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecasts of farm production, imply that farm output is expected to fall by 27 per cent in 2002/03, comparable to the contraction in the early 1980s' drought. ABARE forecasts suggest that farm output could rise by over 20 per cent in 2003/04. ", " Business surveys continue to indicate that current business conditions and businesses' assessment of their own prospects remain positive (Graph 26). However, they report heightened concerns about future developments in the broader economy. The NAB survey, ACCI Survey of Investor Confidence and ACCI-Westpac survey of the manufacturing industry all recorded a decline in business conditions in the March quarter, but remain consistent with trend growth in the non-farm economy. Indicators of new orders, capacity utilisation and employment reported in the ACCI-Westpac survey remain well above long-run average levels. In contrast, measures of business confidence are weaker, with the NAB survey measure falling below long-run average levels and the ACCI-Westpac survey reporting a sharp fall in confidence among manufacturing businesses, to its lowest level since the <span class=\"no-wrap\">beginning of 2001</span>. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey continues to provide a more downbeat reading than other surveys, though in contrast to the other surveys it showed an improvement in conditions in the latest quarter. The latest Rabobank rural confidence survey reported a significant improvement in the outlook for the farm sector, particularly in cropping, and in farmers' investment intentions (Graph 27). ", " Measured on a national accounts basis, in the half year to December 2002, the gross operating surplus (GOS) of the private corporate sector was up 13 per cent on the corresponding period in 2001. Profit growth was robust in industries such as construction, retail trade and transport &amp; storage, reflecting strength in the domestic economy. In contrast, profits continued to fall in the property and business services sector, and mining profits remained lower over the year despite some recovery in the past couple of quarters. The decline in small business profits in the December quarter, as measured by the income of unincorporated enterprises, mainly reflected a 28 per cent fall in farm incomes caused by the drought. Excluding farm income, small business profits grew by around 10 per cent over the year, reflecting favourable conditions in the residential construction and retail sectors. ", " Profit growth reported by listed companies was weaker than that reported in the national accounts (Graph 28). In aggregate, net income for the top 100 companies was down 3 per cent compared to the corresponding <span class=\"no-wrap\">period in 2001</span>. This fall in income was due to write-downs of assets by several large mining, financial and telecommunications companies. ", " The national accounts measure relates to profits earned in Australia and excludes the effects of asset <span class=\"no-wrap\">write-downs</span>. As such, it gives a better indication of the underlying profitability of Australian enterprises. The divergence between this measure and the reported profits of listed companies is due to the large asset <span class=\"no-wrap\">write-downs</span>, weakness in offshore earnings and the impact of the appreciation in the Australian dollar on the value of Australian listed companies' offshore operations. ", " External business funding picked up in the March quarter but still remained lower than the strong levels in the middle part of 2002. The recent pick-up has primarily reflected increased non-intermediated debt raisings; equity raisings have been at a low level for some time. However, the level of corporate internal funding has remained high, owing to the continued increase in profits. Corporate debt interest payments are still around historically low levels as a share of GOS, and consistent with this, business loan arrears remain low. ", " Business investment rose by 10 per cent in the December quarter and by close to 20 per cent over 2002, underpinned by sound corporate profitability and the availability of low-cost funding (Graph 29). There was rapid growth in spending on machinery and equipment (in part reflecting the purchase of a number of aircraft) and buildings and structures. The nascent recovery in spending on computer software also gathered pace, with growth over 2002 climbing to around 12 per cent. ", " Indicators of investment intentions suggest that the current upswing in business investment has further to run, though some pull-back could occur in the near term, as the large jump in civil aircraft deliveries in the December quarter is partially unwound. The December quarter ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey suggests that investment in machinery and equipment is expected to grow by around 11 per cent in nominal terms in the current financial year. Continued growth is also likely in the following year; using a five-year average realisation ratio, the Capex survey suggests growth in spending of around 5½ per cent in 2003/04. However, there is uncertainty regarding how firms' investment plans will evolve in light of global economic developments and the war in Iraq, though business surveys suggest that investment intentions have proven resilient to date. The mining, manufacturing and transport &amp; storage sectors are expected to remain strong contributors to growth in equipment investment in the next financial year, together with an anticipated recovery in investment by the service sectors. A modest recovery in agricultural equipment investment may also occur, on the assumption that the drought is breaking. ", " Most indicators suggest further growth in spending on buildings and structures in both the current financial year and 2003/04 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 30)</span>. After rising by almost 60 per cent through 2002, growth in engineering construction is expected to remain robust in the near term, underpinned by a considerable stock of resource and infrastructure work in the pipeline. These projects include the private sector's contribution to numerous state government infrastructure projects, such as preparations for the Commonwealth Games in 2006. However, even with the likely commencement of further large projects, engineering construction activity may well level <span class=\"no-wrap\">out during 2004</span>, as many sizeable projects are near completion and some government projects could still be deferred. The value of non-residential building work in the early stages of construction remains large, and with the volume of approvals reaching 13-year highs in the second half of 2002, building activity is set to remain strong in the period ahead. This outlook for expenditure on buildings and structures is supported by the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em>, which has reported continued solid growth in the value of projects recently commenced, with a number of significant projects poised to come on stream in the period ahead. ", " Employment increased by a sizeable 3 per cent over the year to the March quarter (Graph 31), with good rises in both full-time and part-time employment. Recent labour force numbers appear to have been affected by the introduction of a new sample, making them more difficult to interpret than usual. However the unemployment rate, which is often less volatile than other indicators, clearly signals that there has been genuine strength in the labour market, having fallen ½ of a percentage point since the March quarter last year. The participation rate reached its highest level on record of 64.4 per cent in the March quarter. ", " All mainland states enjoyed employment growth of 1 per cent or more in the March quarter, and significantly above-trend growth over the year (Table 8). Employment has remained strongest in Queensland, rising by nearly 4 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Most mainland states also experienced a significant decline in their unemployment rates over the year. Tasmania continues to lag the other states in terms of both employment and unemployment outcomes. ", " Outcomes for employment by industry were generally in line with the pattern of output growth over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Table 9)</span>. Employment growth was particularly strong in construction and retail &amp; wholesale trade, consistent with strength in dwelling investment and consumer spending. However, employment in the accommodation, <span class=\"no-wrap\">cafes &amp; restaurants</span> sector contracted over the year, reflecting subdued conditions in the tourism sector. The drought has resulted in a marked decline in agricultural employment, with declines in farm employment most acute in northern and western NSW where the drought has been especially severe. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand have reported mixed signals in recent months, but overall point to continued employment growth in the near term, though at slower rates than have been experienced <span class=\"no-wrap\">recently (Graph 32)</span>. The ABS employer-based job vacancies series reported a very strong rise of 15 per cent in the three months to February, to be 22 per cent higher over the year. In contrast, both the ANZ and DEWR print vacancies series were broadly flat in the quarter and over the year, after accounting for the possible effects of public holidays. The latest readings of the NAB, ACCI-Westpac and Dun &amp; Bradstreet surveys all indicated a slight increase in employment intentions for the coming quarter. ", " The continuation of robust growth in demand in Australia but subdued demand abroad has led to a widening in the trade deficit over the past year and a half, although it narrowed in the March quarter. Assuming that the net income deficit as a proportion of GDP remained constant in the quarter, the current account deficit is likely to have narrowed to around 5¾ per cent of GDP, from 6.2 per cent of GDP in the December quarter (Graph 33). ", " The subdued growth in demand in much of the rest of the world has resulted in falls in the value of resources and manufactured exports over the past year (Table 10). Resources exports did however record a rise of around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> in the March quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in exports of metal ores and minerals. Coal and gold exports, in both value and volume terms, also rose over the past six months. ", " The effects of the weak world economy on services exports have been compounded by heightened concerns about international travel; the modest growth that has occurred in service export earnings over the past year is largely accounted for by price rises. The number of short-term overseas visitor arrivals remains below August 2001 levels (Graph 34) and is likely to continue to be weak in the period ahead, with ongoing fears about terrorism and the spread of SARS. ", " The value of rural exports fell by nearly 20 per cent over the year to the March quarter, reflecting the continued impact of the drought. Drought-related shortages of cereals and wool resulted in higher prices for these exports, partially offsetting the effect of the drought on export volumes. Conversely, meat prices have fallen while volumes have risen strongly as a result of the drought. ", " The Bureau of Meteorology declared in early May that the El Niño event is over. While some areas of the country have not yet had significant follow-up rain to the falls in February, the Bureau believes most drought-affected areas should see appreciably more winter and spring rains in 2003 than in 2002. ABARE is predicting a strong recovery in farm production in 2003/04, though not quite to levels prevailing prior to the drought. The wheat crop in 2003/04 is expected to be more than twice that of the previous year, but slightly less than the <span class=\"no-wrap\">crop in 2001/02</span>. Production of crops such as rice and cotton, however, is unlikely to bounce back in the short term, owing to continuing shortages of irrigation water. The recovery of meat and wool production is also likely to be gradual, given the need to rebuild depleted herds and flocks. ", " The strength of domestic demand, and particularly business investment, in Australia resulted in import growth of around 10 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Imports of capital goods rose by around 9 per cent over the year, notwithstanding a decline in the March quarter as the value of aircraft imports returned towards a more normal level (Graph 35). Imports of consumption goods have been boosted over the past year by a strong rise in motor vehicle imports, in line with the growth in domestic motor vehicles sales, while the sharp rise in imports of intermediate goods in part reflected the sharp rise in the price of oil over the past year. ", " The net income deficit widened slightly in the December quarter, to around 3.2 per cent of GDP. The ratio of net income payments to exports, a measure of Australia's ability to service its liabilities, has risen over the past couple of years but, at 16 per cent, remains low by historical standards. Australia's net foreign liabilities rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1½ per cent</span> in the December quarter, to around 56½ per cent of GDP. An increase in net foreign debt, primarily reflecting a continuation of the recent trend of strong net debt inflows, offset a small decline in net foreign equity liabilities. ", " Commodity prices have fallen since the beginning of the year (Graph 36). Rural commodity prices have declined by more than 9 per cent since their peak in October 2002, and have broadly unwound the drought-related price increases that occurred in 2002. Wheat prices have fallen by around 25 per cent over this period in expectation of the breaking of the droughts in the US and Australia. Beef and veal prices have fallen further because of the combination of weak external demand and increased domestic slaughter rates, but are expected to rise sharply in the near term as a result of rainfall returning to more normal levels. ", " The war in Iraq has resulted in significant volatility in the prices of oil and gold in recent months. The price of gold rose to over US$380 per ounce in early February, but has subsequently declined by more than 10 per cent. Oil price developments are discussed in detail in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-economic-developments\">International Economic  Developments</a>’. After rising sharply in February, base metals prices have fallen to below their level at the beginning of the year. The rise in February and the subsequent fall have primarily resulted from movements in the prices of aluminium and nickel. ", " A major contract for the export of Australian hard coking coal to Japan this year was settled in late March, with prices 4.3 per cent lower than in 2002 in US dollar terms (Graph 37). Australian thermal coal producers also concluded a major contract negotiation for the Japanese market, agreeing on a 6.8 per cent price fall from <span class=\"no-wrap\">last year</span>. ", " As in offshore markets, the predominant influence on domestic financial markets for much of the past three months has been the Iraq situation, rather than the usual flow of economic news. Bond yields and share market prices fell through February and the early part of March, reflecting rising uncertainty as military preparations gathered pace (Graph 38). In mid March, once it became clear that war was imminent, domestic markets experienced the same sharp reversals seen in other countries, with share prices and bond yields rising. The reversal reflected the prevailing view that the war would be over quickly and that therefore the downside economic risks to the world economy were limited. Domestic bond yields and equity prices ended the period slightly above the levels prevailing at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>. ", " Short-term interest rates, particularly in the six to twelve month maturities, declined ahead of the commencement of hostilities in Iraq, as uncertainty about the nature of the conflict and its possible economic impact mounted. The 180-day bank bill yield, which was around 4.75 per cent at the end of January, reached a low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.60 per cent</span> near the middle of March. However, the subsequent sharp rise in rates means that there has been little net change in short-term market yields over the past three months. ", " The target cash rate has remained unchanged at 4.75 per cent over the past three months. Money market expectations of a monetary policy easing that existed three months ago have persisted, but they have been pushed back somewhat. The money market is currently factoring in a reduction of 25 basis points in the target cash rate during the third quarter of this year (Graph 39). In early March, when concern about the economic impact of a conflict in Iraq was at its peak, the market began to price in a second reduction in the target cash rate by the end of the year. However, this proved short-lived. ", " As noted, movements in domestic bond yields over the past three months have also been heavily influenced by developments in the Iraq situation. Despite a continued run of generally positive domestic economic news, 10-year government bond yields declined through February and early March, reaching a two-year low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.98 per cent</span>. They then rose sharply to almost 5.60 per cent in the middle of the month as government bond yields in the US moved higher on the prospect of a short military campaign. This rise has since been partly reversed as investors have refocused their attention on the global economic outlook. Yields on 10-year government bonds were around 5.25 per cent in early May, close to their average level in January (Graph 40). ", " The yield curve in Australia remains relatively flat. The spread between 10-year government bond yields and cash is now around 50 basis points, around half its long-run average. Yields out to maturities of three years remain at levels below the cash rate (Graph 41). This pattern in the yield curve suggests that markets attach a greater probability to falling, rather than rising, interest rates in the period ahead. ", " The move lower in government bond yields in February and early March was less pronounced in Australia than in the US, reflecting among other things the stronger economic news domestically. As a result, the 10-year nominal yield differential between these two markets widened significantly around that time, touching a six-month <span class=\"no-wrap\">high of almost</span> 170 basis points. Since then, the spread has narrowed to 140 basis points as US yields have risen. The current spread remains well above the average spread of about 50 points that prevailed <span class=\"no-wrap\">between 1997 and 2001 (Graph 42)</span>. ", " Like nominal yields, real bond yields in Australia declined through February and early March, the yield on 10-year government indexed bonds falling by around 30 basis points from end January to 2.85 per cent. This was a much smaller fall than that in US real yields and, as a result, the 10-year real bond yield spread between the two markets widened from 120 basis points in January to 165 basis points in mid March (Graph 43). As in the case of the nominal yield spread, some of this was subsequently reversed as US real yields rose. In early May, the real 10-year bond yield spread stood at just over 115 basis points. ", " Credit spreads on Australian corporate bonds have continued to narrow over the past three months (Graph 44). Factors contributing to this have included the diminished supply of new debt (see below), some switching from equities into bonds by investors, and some general decline in risk aversion since late last year. The narrowing of credit spreads in the Australian market mirrors trends seen in the US. Spreads on some non-residents' issues (particularly non-resident financial institutions) have narrowed significantly. Credit spreads are now around <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> below the peaks seen in October last year and slightly below their historical averages. ", " After tracking sideways for much of the December quarter, domestic equity prices began declining in January on the back of some company-specific news and more general concerns about weakness in the global economy. Fears about the possible economic fall-out from a war in Iraq weighed increasingly on the equity market through February and early March. By mid March, the ASX 200 index was down 10 per cent from the start of the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 45)</span>. As prospects for a quick resolution of the Iraq conflict strengthened, the market rebounded strongly and in early May equity prices were around the same level as at the start of the year. By comparison, the US S&amp;P 500 is 5 per cent higher than its level at the start of the year. Over the longer term, however, the Australian market has held up well compared to its US counterpart, with the ASX 200 falling 4 per cent over the past three years compared to a fall of 37 per cent in the S&amp;P 500. ", " The recent rebound in equity prices has been broadly based, with all sectors rising since mid March. The energy, consumer staples, financial and utilities sector indices are currently back above their early January levels, while other sector indices remain below their end-January levels. Within the financial sector, the index of bank share prices has risen while the comparable index for insurance companies has fallen. The insurance sector index of the ASX 200 is currently around half its peak level in June 2001. ", " Uncertainty relating to the Iraq situation saw measures of future equity market volatility derived from options rise noticeably through early 2003 (Graph 46). The rise in volatility was associated with the market factoring in a greater likelihood of large falls in equity prices. These concerns also led to high levels of trading activity in the futures market throughout March. In line with the rebound in sentiment in the equity market itself since mid March, much of the rise in volatility and perceived downside risk has since been reversed. Expected volatility remains above the levels seen at the start of the year, though only around half the volatility in the US market, and well below the volatility that was evident in the late 1990s. ", " The recent rise in equity prices coupled with a fall in reported earnings (refer the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-activity\">Domestic Economic  Activity</a>’) has seen a slight increase in Australia's P/E ratio, to 28 (Graph 47). Losses reported by News Corporation during the past 12 months continue to affect the aggregate P/E ratio; excluding News Corporation, the ratio is around 18, which is around its long-run average. ", " Reflecting the outcomes for the six months to December and some scaling back by companies of expected future earnings, analysts have revised down their forecasts for earnings per share for 2002/03. Year-on-year growth of just 1 per cent is now expected for the ASX 200 companies (down from 10 per cent in January). Downward revisions were most pronounced for the financial, telecommunications and health care sectors. Earnings per share forecasts for 2003/04 have also been revised lower, although not to the same extent as forecasts for the current financial year (Graph 48). As a result, earnings per share are forecast to increase by 22 per cent in 2003/04. ", " In recent years, companies have generally maintained or increased their dividend payouts and the aggregate dividend payout ratio and dividend yield have risen. The aggregate dividend yield is now broadly similar to the returns paid on money market securities, a situation which is quite unusual compared with the experience of the past 20 years (Graph 49). ", " Intermediaries' interest rates on variable-rate loans have been unchanged since June 2002 reflecting the constant target for the cash rate (Table 11). In contrast, banks' indicator fixed rates for housing loans have declined considerably over this period. Since the previous <em>Statement</em>, banks' 3-year fixed housing rates have fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span>. This decline largely reflects a delayed response to falls in the swap rate in late 2002. While fixed housing rates are now almost half a percentage point lower than standard variable rates, the proportion of approvals for fixed-rate loans has declined in recent months. This perhaps suggests that home owners remain of the view that interest rates could fall further in the future. Fixed interest rates on loans to small businesses have changed little so far in 2003, though they remain 105 basis points below the level prevailing at the <span class=\"no-wrap\">end of June 2002</span>. ", " Overall financing activity remains robust due to the continued strong growth in intermediated credit, particularly household credit. Overall bond issuance also remains strong, though there has been a switch from domestic to offshore issuance reflecting favourable borrowing conditions in offshore markets. Financing activity in the equity market, however, remains at a low level. ", " Total credit increased at an annual rate of 11.8 per cent over the six months to March, continuing the strong pace of growth evident over the past year (Graph 50). The strength in growth in total credit has continued to be underpinned by strong growth in household credit, particularly for housing-related purchases. Growth in business credit has been fairly subdued in recent months. ", " Housing credit increased at an annualised rate of 21.2 per cent over the six months to March, slightly faster than the pace in the previous six months. This is in line with earlier strength in housing loan approvals, which rose strongly over 2002 driven mainly by a rise in approvals to investors. Consistent with this, growth in credit for investor housing has continued to outpace growth in housing credit for owner-occupation. While remaining at very high levels, loan approvals for both owner-occupiers and investors have levelled off recently. Personal credit continues to grow at a more moderate pace than in the middle of 2002, though growth has picked up in recent months. ", " After showing some strength around the end of 2002 and into 2003, growth in business credit has been more subdued over recent months. Over the three months to March, business credit increased by 5.5 per cent in annualised terms, compared with annualised growth of 8.6 per cent over the three months to January. A trend fall in commercial loan approvals over the past six months suggests that growth in business credit is likely to remain moderate. ", " On the other side of financial intermediaries' balance sheets, growth in the broader monetary aggregates has remained firm over the past few months (Graph 51). Over the six months to March, broad money grew by <span class=\"no-wrap\">12.4 per cent</span> in annualised terms, compared with annualised growth of 9.1 per cent over the six months to September. Growth in broad money over the past three months has been broadly in line with growth in credit. ", " Total bond issuance for the March quarter was $30.6 billion, somewhat larger than both the outcome in the previous quarter ($24.5 billion) and the quarterly average for 2002 ($24 billion). Financial institutions and <span class=\"no-wrap\">asset-backed</span> vehicles were the main issuers. ", " The noticeable characteristic of the quarter was the switch from domestic to offshore issuance. Non-government debt issuance in the domestic market slowed to $6.2 billion, about one-third less than average quarterly issuance over the past four years (Table 12). Offshore issuance, in contrast, was a record $24.5 billion, up almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">60 per cent</span> compared to the December quarter. April has seen a continuation of the March quarter trend of subdued domestic issuance and strong offshore issuance. ", " The strength of offshore issuance reflects strong overseas demand for Australian dollar securities. This is encouraging many non-residents to issue Australian dollar debt that they then swap back into their own currency. In doing so, they have moved swap spreads in a way that has made it very attractive for Australian borrowers to issue foreign currency debt and swap it into Australian dollars (see <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>). The bulk of offshore issuance by Australian borrowers was denominated in foreign currencies (and subsequently hedged) (Graph 52). As is usually the case, offshore issuance has been dominated by financial institutions. ", " Domestic non-government bond issuance over the quarter was just sufficient to match maturities, leaving the volume of non-government debt little changed at $125 billion (Graph 53). Total debt outstanding has held steady around this level since October last year. ", " The slowdown in equity market issuance since the peak in the June quarter of 2002 continued in the most recent quarter (Graph 54). During the March quarter just $1.1 billion was raised by non-financial companies. Raisings were again dominated by secondary issues, particularly private placements, dividend reinvestment plans and rights issues. In addition to the AMP capital raising currently underway, the Promina insurance group is due to list on 12 May and is expected to raise up to $2 billion. A public listing by Virgin Blue airlines has also been proposed. ", " With the cash rate unchanged since June last year, the general structure of short-term interest rates remains much as was described in the February <em>Statement</em>. Prior to the two increases in mid 2002, the cash rate had been at a historical low of 4.25 per cent, and its current level of 4.75 per cent remains towards the lower end of the range in which it has fluctuated during the past decade. Variable interest rates of financial intermediaries have generally moved in line with the cash rate in recent years, and are similarly close to their historical lows. Measures of real interest rates confirm the picture that levels of short-term rates are relatively low in historical terms. Based on a variety of alternative measures of inflation expectations, the cash rate and indicator rates of financial intermediaries in real terms are currently as much as 1 percentage point below their averages of recent years <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 55);</span> they are somewhat further below average if the comparison is made over a longer time period. Hence the increases which took place in mid 2002 have brought short-term interest rates up from their recent lows, but based on a range of historical benchmarks they remain at levels that are relatively expansionary. ", " Long-term bond yields have declined markedly over the past year, with the bulk of the decline occurring in the second half of 2002. This movement occurred at a time when bond yields were declining around the world, reflecting downward reassessments of growth prospects in the major economies and, consequently, downward revisions to the expected medium-term path of short-term interest rates. The decline in bond yields contributed to a flattening of the yield curve in Australia over the past year, though this has broadly stabilised in the past few months. With bond yields generally fluctuating in a range between around 5 and 5½ per cent recently, the yield curve has been relatively stable in the past few months, and has remained moderately upward sloping. ", " Reflecting borrowing rates that are close to historical lows, businesses and households do not appear to be constrained to any significant degree by the cost and availability of credit. As discussed above in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’, credit to the household sector is growing at an exceptionally fast pace at present. Borrowing by businesses has been more subdued, but this does not seem to reflect any difficulty in accessing credit, and, with a high level of aggregate profitability, businesses appear to have ample funding available for their investment plans. Credit spreads in corporate bond markets have declined in recent months to a relatively low level, suggesting that concerns about credit quality are unlikely to be hampering businesses' access to capital markets. Overall, then, the indications are that conditions in Australian financial markets continue to be supportive of growth in spending and activity. ", " In addition to these developments in domestic financial markets, there has been a further appreciation of the Australian dollar in recent months, following a lengthy period when the currency had been well below historical average levels. Since the start of the year the currency has appreciated by around 10 per cent in trade-weighted terms, though coming from a relatively low base. The current level of the trade-weighted exchange rate is around its post-float average and would appear to be roughly neutral in its impact on the traded sector of the economy at present. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 1.3 per cent in the March quarter to be 3.4 per cent higher over the year (Table 13, Graph 56). Measures of underlying inflation ranged between ½ and 1 per cent in the quarter and between 2 and 3 per cent in year-ended terms (Graph 57). Differences between these measures can be explained in terms of the treatment of items that have experienced relatively large price rises in the quarter and over the year. Overall, the Bank's assessment is that, in year-ended terms, underlying inflation is currently around 2¾ per cent, implying a slight pick-up from the previous quarter. ", " The largest contribution to the rise in the CPI in the quarter was made by fuel prices, which increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">8½ per cent</span> in the quarter and by 17½ per cent over the year. More recently, world oil prices have fallen back to their levels in late 2002, suggesting that much of the increase in fuel prices this quarter will be reversed in the June quarter. Higher vegetable prices also made a significant contribution to CPI inflation in the quarter, increasing by almost 12 per cent, primarily as a result of ongoing supply problems related to the drought. The prices of a range of other food items were also affected by the drought, including eggs, bread, cereals and lamb. House purchase costs, which have a large weight in the CPI, rose by 1½ per cent in the quarter and by 4¼ per cent over the year, reflecting rising construction costs as a result of the high level of housing activity. Rental prices, however, rose only slightly in aggregate and fell in Sydney and Darwin. ", " Several other categories of the CPI also recorded large price increases in the quarter: the price of pharmaceuticals increased by almost 12 per cent, in large part due to the seasonal operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; electricity prices increased by over 5 per cent, partly reflecting deregulation of the electricity industry in South Australia; and education prices rose by 4½ per cent. ", " Partly offsetting these increases, a number of categories recorded price falls in the quarter. Audio, visual and computing equipment prices continued their steady decline, falling by 4½ per cent in the quarter and by over <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> over the year. In addition, there were broad-based price falls in clothing, footwear, furniture and household appliances, in part reflecting the influence of the exchange rate appreciation. ", " As noted above, differences between the various measures of underlying inflation can be explained in terms of the treatment of items that have experienced relatively large price movements in the quarter and over the year. The <em>CPI excluding volatile items</em> measure of underlying inflation excludes the influence of movements in fuel and fruit &amp; vegetable prices, which made strong positive contributions to the CPI; this measure rose by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span> over the year to March. The <em>market goods and services excluding volatile items</em> measure, which is at the lower end of the range of measures, excludes these items plus a number of other items that experienced above-average price rises in the quarter, including pharmaceuticals, electricity and education. This measure appears to be understating inflationary pressures at present. ", " The statistical weighted median and trimmed mean measures exclude extreme price movements in both directions. When based on the distribution of quarterly price changes, these measures have recorded increases of 0.9 and 0.8 per cent in the quarter and 3 per cent and 2½ per cent, respectively, over the past year. ", " Producer price increases at all stages of production have picked up in year-ended terms, in part reflecting movements in oil prices (Graph 58). Excluding the effects of oil-related price movements, there was still a noticeable increase in upstream inflationary pressures in domestically produced items (Table 14). There were large increases in construction prices in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength in this sector, and relatedly, in the cost of real estate agent services. Other notable price increases in the quarter were recorded for major agricultural items such as beef, and for utilities such as electricity and gas. ", " The increase in domestically sourced price pressures has been partly offset by price falls in a broad range of imported goods at all stages of production owing to the appreciation of the exchange rate. Large price falls were particularly noticeable for electronic equipment, reflecting the combined effects of the exchange rate appreciation and falling world prices for these commodities. ", " Indicators of upstream price pressures from business surveys remain moderate, but also have risen in recent quarters. The NAB survey reported that purchase costs increased by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter, having averaged 0.4 per cent in the previous four quarters. Expectations for the increase in purchase costs in the June quarter also rose to 0.5 per cent. The ACCI-Westpac survey reported that the net balance of manufacturing firms experiencing an increase in costs per unit of output also picked up for the second consecutive quarter, although it remains well below recent peaks. ", " Tighter labour market conditions over the past year have led to a slight pick-up in wage growth in recent quarters, although most labour cost indicators suggest that wage pressures generally remain contained. In the December quarter, the wage cost index (WCI) for total pay increased by 0.9 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier (Graph 59). At the industry level, the WCI recorded the fastest annual wage growth in electricity, gas &amp; water (4.6 per cent), and the slowest in communication services (3.0 per cent). ", " Business surveys also point to some increase in the pace of wage growth. According to the NAB survey measure, growth in total labour costs picked up over the year to March, and a broadly similar pace is expected in the next quarter. The NAB survey also reports that firms are having some difficulty in attracting suitable labour, although the ACCI-Westpac survey suggests that conditions are somewhat easier in the manufacturing sector. ", " Consistent with these developments, data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations indicate that the pace of wage growth in new enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) picked up in the second half of last year to 4.1 per cent. While part of the increase reflected a shift in the composition of new agreements from low-wage to high-wage industries, there appears to have been a slight increase in the underlying pace of new EBA wages over the past year. Wage increases for the stock of existing agreements remained at 3.8 per cent in the December quarter. The latest Mercer <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em> suggests that annual growth in executives' base salaries remained unchanged at 4 per cent in March. ", " The various wage bill measures continue to give divergent readings. Average weekly ordinary-time earnings of full-time adults (AWOTE) grew by 1.1 per cent in the December quarter, to be 4.8 per cent higher over the year. (For a discussion of the interpretation of wage-bill measures, see ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2002/aug/1.html#box-b\">Box B:  Measures of Labour Costs</a>’ in the August 2002 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.) The national accounts measure of compensation per employee grew by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter to be 3.2 per cent higher over the year. On a per hour basis, compensation grew by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span> higher over the year, reflecting a decline in average hours worked. Unit labour costs (based on compensation per hour worked), increased by 1.1 per cent in the December quarter to be 2.8 per cent higher over the year. ", " In its Safety Net Review decision, announced on 6 May, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission granted a $17 per week increase in award rates up to and including $731.80 per week, and a $15 per week increase in higher award rates. Consequently, the federal minimum wage increased by 3.9 per cent to $448.40 per week. ", " Inflation expectations generally remain contained. According to the latest NAB quarterly survey, businesses continue to expect modest inflation in the near term; retail and other final product prices are expected to rise by 0.4 per cent in the June quarter (Graph 60). Having pointed to slightly higher inflation expectations since late last year, the most recent Melbourne Institute survey suggests that consumers have revised down their expectations to a level consistent with the average of their expectations over the inflation-targeting period. ", " Longer-term inflation expectations of investors, measured by the difference between 10-year bond yields and indexed bonds, have been between 2 and 2½ per cent since August 2002. Financial market economists surveyed by the Bank after the March quarter CPI was released have revised their median inflation forecast for the year to June 2003, from 2.8 per cent to 3.2 per cent (Table 15). For the year to June 2004, their median forecast fell marginally to 2.3 per cent, partly reflecting expectations of a further appreciation in the Australian dollar. Trade union officials surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT) have revised their near-term median inflation forecast up to 3.5 per cent and expect inflation to remain at this level over the year to June 2004. ", " The Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation was around 2¾ per cent over the year to March, and that it is likely to ease in the second half of 2003 to around 2½ per cent and remain around that rate over the following year. The difference between this expected path of underlying inflation and that reported in the previous <em>Statement</em> largely reflects the assessment that the March quarter CPI outcome indicated more inflationary pressures in the economy than had been anticipated, although these will be partly offset by the recent appreciation of the exchange rate. These projections are based on the assumptions that the exchange rate remains around current levels, and international oil prices remain around the middle of the OPEC target range. ", " This outlook is consistent with recent wage outcomes which, despite picking up in recent quarters, have remained moderate. Other cost pressures have increased modestly in the recent period. Producer price data and business surveys indicate that upstream price pressures have increased a little over the past couple of quarters. Inflationary pressures from rising oil prices and domestic sources, such as higher house purchase costs, have been present both in producer prices and in the CPI, although some of these pressures are expected to ease in the period ahead. The increases in domestic inflationary pressures have been offset to some extent by the disinflationary effects of an appreciating exchange rate and subdued world prices for items such as electronic equipment. ", " Much of the discrepancy between CPI inflation and underlying inflation over the year to March can be explained in terms of sharply higher oil prices. In the June quarter to date, oil prices have fallen back to levels seen at the end of last year, and consequently the recent effect of petrol price rises on the CPI is likely to be largely reversed in the June quarter. The drought-related increases in food prices such as vegetables, bread and cereals are also likely to be reversed to some extent over 2003 as rural production conditions improve. However, the breaking of the drought would also be likely to place upward pressure on the prices of some items; for example meat prices would be expected to rise as producers limited supply during herd rebuilding. Overall, with the influence of the drought and oil market developments abating, we expect that CPI inflation will align more closely with underlying inflation over the course of 2003. ", " The main source of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for inflation continues to be the outlook for world growth. The most significant piece of news over the past quarter bearing on the international outlook is that the near-term uncertainty associated with the conflict in Iraq has been largely resolved. This has been reflected in the fall in oil prices to well below US$30 per barrel, which is a positive development for world growth. Nonetheless, the prospects for the global economy remain subject to considerable uncertainty. If the global recovery were to fall short of current expectations, it would imply a weaker growth outlook in Australia and, consequently, weaker inflationary pressures. ", " The main upside risk to the inflation outlook would be if inflation expectations were to rise following the recent higher CPI outcomes: these have been at or above the target for a year now. At this stage, however, there is little sign of this occurring. While the Melbourne Institute survey of consumers had indicated some increase in inflation expectations in the early months of this year, they have returned to their average of the inflation targeting period in the latest survey, consistent with lower oil prices. Overall, the risks to the inflation forecast appear to be evenly balanced. ", " Crude oil prices have shown considerable volatility of late, reflecting uncertainties about the conflict in Iraq and the extent of any disruption to oil production in the region. This box outlines the importance of the Middle East in global supply. ", " Around 40 per cent of the world's crude oil production comes from Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fna1\" id=\"ra1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup>, the bulk of which is from countries in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest producer, accounting for nearly 12 per cent of total output in 2001, closely followed by <span class=\"no-wrap\">Russia (10 per cent)</span> and the United States (9 per cent). These shares have been reasonably steady over the past few years, following the large decline in oil production in Russia in the early 1990s. The remaining 70 per cent of the world's crude oil production is distributed fairly evenly across the main geographic regions though, apart from the Middle East, it is concentrated in a few countries in each region. ", " OPEC members' share of world crude oil exports is significantly larger than their share of production, reflecting the degree to which other oil producers consume their own product. Saudi Arabia is by far the largest exporter of crude oil, accounting for 16 per cent of total exports in 2000; the remaining OPEC members accounted for 38 per cent of exports (Graph A1). Exports from Iraq, which were suspended in mid March 2003, accounted for 5 per cent of total exports in 2000. ", " The United States is the world's largest consumer of oil, with a little less than half of its consumption met from domestic production (Table A1). China was self-sufficient in oil until 1993 but rapid growth in domestic demand resulted in production accounting for less than 70 per cent of consumption by 2000. Other large oil consumers such as Japan, Germany and South Korea rely on imports for almost all of their consumption. In aggregate, Australia's consumption of oil is roughly matched by output but there are some imbalances between the types of oil produced and consumed, and hence Australia both imports and exports oil. ", " Industrialised countries' inventories of oil are typically lower than a year ago, despite an increase in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US Government's</span> Strategic Petroleum Reserve. More fundamentally, however, these countries have generally been quite successful in reducing their dependence on oil since the early 1970s. (For more details, see <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2000/nov/1.html#box-a\">Box A</a> in the November 2000 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>.) ", " As well as being major producers of crude oil, OPEC members account for almost all of the world's current spare capacity (which can be accessed in a short period of time). Moreover, OPEC members currently account for around two-thirds of proven oil reserves, although their share has fallen from around 80 per cent last year following the new-found viability of oil sands in Canada (Graph A2). Saudi Arabia possesses the largest share of proven reserves, accounting for just over one-fifth of global reserves. ", " March 2003 marked the third anniversary of the peak in global equity prices. Since then equity price indices in all the major countries have fallen significantly. ", " In the case of the US share market, prices have fallen by around 40 per cent from their peak in March 2000, though they are still around 45 per cent higher than in the mid 1990s. This fall is the largest retracement since the Great Depression of the early 1930s, when nominal prices fell by over 80 per cent. The most recent comparable nominal correction occurred in 1973–74 when the US S&amp;P also fell by just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent (Graph B1)</span>. ", " The current bear market is only the fifth time since 1870 that broad measures of US share prices have fallen for three or more consecutive calendar years. The market has only once fallen for four years in a row <span class=\"no-wrap\">(1929–1932)</span>. ", " While the recent fall in US share prices has been large, the slump in most other major markets has been even more pronounced (Graph B2). In most European countries, share prices have fallen by between <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 and 70 per cent</span> since their peak. However, these share markets also generally experienced the largest increases in the second half of the 1990s (Table B1). ", " In the euro area, share price indices more than tripled over the second half of the1990s. A factor contributing to this surge was the large weight of the financial and telecommunication sectors in European share markets compared with the US. To the extent that the largest increases were recorded in some of the smaller countries, this may also have reflected a build-up of ebullient expectations in Europe ahead of the introduction of the euro, with some of the smaller countries expected to benefit most from the introduction of the single currency. German share prices have been very weak in the latest downturn, owing mainly to the under-performance of German banks and insurance companies. ", " The experience of the UK has been somewhat different from the rest of Europe. In the UK, the increase in share prices in the second half of the 1990s was modest compared with the rest of Europe and the US. To a large degree this reflected the small number of information technology firms represented in the UK index. The fall in UK share prices since the 2000 peak, however, has been similar in size to that of the US. As a result, share prices in the UK are now only marginally above where they were in the middle of the 1990s. ", " In Japan, share prices are now down 73 per cent from their peak in December 1989. Even though Japanese share prices had already experienced a large fall by the time the US market started to decline in 2000, they have since fallen by more than the US market. ", " As has been discussed in recent articles published in the RBA <cite>Bulletin</cite>, the sustainability of debt levels depends importantly on the share of borrowers' incomes required to service the debt, that is, the payment of the associated interest costs.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnc1\" id=\"rc1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " In assessing the level of debt service, the RBA makes two adjustments to the measure of household interest payments published by the ABS in the national accounts. Firstly, the ABS deducts a portion of the interest paid as being payment by households for the financial intermediation services provided by financial institutions. The spread between the interest rates at which financial intermediaries borrow from the public and the interest rates at which they lend is assumed to represent the price of intermediation services to households. The service charges imputed from the interest spread, referred to as Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM), are attributed to both borrowers and depositors to capture this means of recovering the costs of financial intermediation. A series of actual (gross) interest payments on debt, which adds back the imputed service charge, can be constructed based on unpublished ABS data. ", " Secondly, even taking account of the above adjustment, recent levels of interest payments appear too low given the levels of debt and prevailing interest rates. To account for this, from the December quarter 2000, the gross interest payments data have been adjusted so that the implied average interest rate maintains a margin over the cash rate consistent with that observed in recent years. ", " The resultant series is shown as the upper line on Graph C1; it has fluctuated with the interest rate cycle around a gradual upward trend. The lower line in Graph C1 shows the equivalent series for the debt-servicing requirement for mortgage debt alone. This series shows a clearer upward trend, with more moderate cyclical swings. ", " Currently mortgage interest payments account for around 6 per cent of household disposable income, around 1 percentage point higher than in 1990. The increase in the mortgage debt-servicing ratio has occurred because the ratio of outstanding mortgage debt to income has risen substantially since 1990, which has more than offset the effect of lower mortgage interest rates. ", " Allowing for required principal repayments as well as interest payments would increase the current level of the debt-servicing ratio by an additional 2½ percentage points or so, an amount which is likely to have increased in recent years along with rising debt levels. It is also worth noting that because the majority of households have no mortgage debt, the servicing cost for those households that do is a good deal higher than indicated by the aggregate figure. ", " While following the same general trend as mortgage interest costs for much of the past two decades, total interest costs peaked in the late 1980s. Personal loans, which carry a relatively high interest rate, were a much larger share of total household debt at that time than they are now, and the average interest rate on personal loans rose more in the late 1980s than did mortgage rates. ", " The first quarter of 2003 saw unprecedented offshore issuance of Australian dollar denominated bonds. In total, $15.5 billion of Australian dollar Eurobonds were issued, about three times the quarterly average of the previous year. Three-quarters of the bond issues were by non-Australian borrowers (Graph D1), and approximately two-thirds of the bonds were sold to Japanese retail investors in the so-called <em>uridashi</em> <span class=\"no-wrap\">market (Graph D2)</span>. ", " The strong offshore demand for Australian dollar bonds reflects the relatively high yield on Australian bonds and the perceived undervaluation, and expected appreciation, of the Australian dollar. The historically low interest rates in Japan have made Australian dollar bonds particularly attractive to Japanese retail investors. ", " The strong demand by offshore investors has allowed borrowers issuing bonds offshore to obtain cheaper funding than would have been available had they issued bonds in the domestic market. Indeed, a number of highly rated borrowers have issued <em>uridashi</em> bonds at lower yields than those prevailing on Australian government bonds. Even after the additional costs incurred in marketing an issue through the retail network of a Japanese broker are taken into account, <em>uridashi</em> funding has been cheaper than other forms of Australian dollar denominated finance. Consistent with this, there has been some substitution away from the domestic bond market, particularly by highly-rated non-resident borrowers. ", " Many issuers of fixed-rate bonds (which includes most Australian dollar Eurobonds) look to swap the fixed interest rate into a floating interest rate. In addition, non-resident issuers may also look to swap the proceeds into their domestic currency.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnd1\" id=\"rd1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> With Australian dollar bond issuance by non-residents rising sharply in recent months, there has been a commensurate increase in swap market activity which has had an impact on rates in the swap markets. ", " The increased volume of offshore Australian dollar bond issuance has increased the demand to receive fixed interest in the domestic interest rate swap market, causing the swap rate to decline. The downward pressure has flowed through to government bond yields as the swap counterparties, in turn, have hedged their interest rate risk by buying government bonds. This effect has been less marked than the effect on the swap rate, so the differential between the swap rate and the government bond yield (the ‘swap spread’) has fallen <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph D3)</span>. ", " Similarly, strong issuance by non-Australian borrowers has affected pricing in the cross-currency swap market. Historically, there has been more demand for swaps where the counterparty pays an Australian dollar interest rate and receives a US dollar interest rate than the other way round. The balance of demand stems in part from the smaller size of the Australian dollar market relative to that of the US dollar. As a result, the counterparty paying the Australian dollars generally has had to pay a small premium (known as the ‘basis swap spread’) over the Australian floating rate. Increased demand from <em>uridashi</em> and other Eurobond issuers to pay US dollars and receive Australian dollars in the first quarter of 2003 caused the basis swap spread to decline to the point where it became negative, although it has subsequently recovered somewhat. ", " Other things equal, the decline in the basis swap spread has made it more attractive for Australian borrowers to issue in foreign currency and swap the proceeds into Australian dollars than to borrow in Australian dollars. Consistent with this, the first quarter of 2003 also saw record foreign currency issuance by Australian companies. At least some of the issuance appeared to be substitution away from Australian dollar bonds <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph D4)</span>.

For the global economy, prospects for growth have improved considerably after a period of deterioration in the first half of the year. The early stages of this improvement were already apparent at the time of the August <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, and subsequent information from most parts of the global economy indicates that conditions have strengthened further. ", " In the United States, the pick-up in growth that had been expected for the second half of the year is now underway. The national accounts recorded strong growth in the September quarter, and the prevailing conditions in the US seem favourable to continued recovery in a number of respects. Monetary and fiscal policy settings are highly expansionary; profits have picked up over the past six months; business inventories are at low levels, suggesting that production will need to accelerate to keep pace with demand; and surveys suggest that business confidence is rising. The labour market has been disappointing to date, but there have been some tentative signs of improvement recently, with a gradual decline in new jobless claims and an increase in non-farm employment in September. Taking all these things together, the prospects for the US economy, while not entirely free of risk, look better than for some time. ", " Recent data from other parts of the world have also been stronger over recent months, though less so in the euro area. In east Asia, the data available for the September quarter show a strong bounce-back in growth in a number of the smaller economies in the region, while China continues to grow at a rapid pace. In addition, the Japanese economy continues in a cyclical upswing, with an easing in the rate of price deflation and improvements in business confidence. ", " The generally positive run of economic data around the world has been reflected in a clear change in sentiment in financial markets since mid-year, as concerns that the global recovery would falter gave way to increasing confidence about the outlook. This is evident in several areas. First, bond yields and share prices have risen around the world. Second, commodity prices have firmed, and resource stocks have outperformed in global equity markets, despite the substantial rise in the exchange rates of the countries of domicile of these resource companies. ", " Third, market expectations of official interest rates have also been affected. In most countries, the short end of the yield curve implies a view that official interest rates are at their trough for the current cycle, and attention is now focused mainly on the question of when interest rates will begin to rise. In Australia, as well as reflecting the favourable overseas developments, financial markets have been influenced by the run of strong local economic data, with the result that markets had begun to anticipate some tightening of monetary policy ahead of the Board's November decision, though a rise in cash rates had only been fully priced for the December meeting. ", " Finally, currencies which traditionally have been favoured by investors in the upswing in the international business cycle have risen in value, the Australian dollar among them. This has brought the trade-weighted index to a level slightly higher than its mid-year peak – but in circumstances quite different to those which prevailed then. At that time, the rise was largely driven by expectations that other countries would cut interest rates further due to weak growth. More recently, the rise in the exchange rate has occurred against a background of strengthening economic conditions, both in Australia and abroad. In this environment a rising exchange rate is the normal pattern. ", " The improving international situation has been accompanied by a marked strengthening of the domestic economy since mid-year. Consumer spending in Australia has picked up over recent months, with strong growth being recorded in retail sales and in motor vehicle sales. Consumer confidence, after increasing earlier in the year, has in the past few months been close to historical highs. The buoyancy of consumer spending is being supported by rising household wealth, driven in large part by continuing increases in house prices. ", " In addition to the strength of consumer spending, the prospects are for continued strength in business investment. Businesses are reporting substantial improvements in business conditions and in confidence about the future. According to a range of surveys, business confidence has now risen to levels consistent with <span class=\"no-wrap\">well-above-average</span> growth of the economy, with profits, sales and employment all reported to have increased strongly in the past few months. The unemployment rate has declined in recent months, to levels last seen in the late 1980s. ", " The one area of the Australian economy not to share in this general strength to date has been the export sector, where performance has been held back by a number of factors including the weak global environment of the past couple of years, the drought, the downturn in international tourism earlier this year, and the recent appreciation of the exchange rate. However, there are signs that the trough in exports has now passed. Rural exports will start to recover from the end of 2003, while international tourist numbers have already bounced back after their sharp drop in the June quarter. The improving global situation should mean, during 2004, a more favourable climate for most types of exports. ", " Inflation in Australia over the year to the September quarter was 2.6 per cent. This was little changed from the June figure, but noticeably below the results earlier in the year. The main reason for the recent decline in inflation is the dampening effect from the exchange rate appreciation over the past two years. This has resulted in a sharp fall in import prices and a broader deceleration of the prices of traded goods in the CPI. In contrast, inflation in the domestically oriented sectors of the economy has continued at a higher rate, with the non-traded component of the CPI increasing by around 4 per cent over the latest year, reflecting ongoing growth in costs and strong domestic demand pressures. ", " In the short term, continued pass-through of lower import prices will reduce the overall inflation rate. Over the longer term, inflation can be expected to be driven more by domestic pressures. The Bank's current assessment is that inflation could fall a little further than earlier expected over the next year, but pick up a little more after that, so that it will be about 2½ per cent by the second half of 2005. The balance of risks around this medium-term central forecast, however, seems now to be shifting to the upside. Businesses are already reporting <span class=\"no-wrap\">greater-than-average</span> difficulty in obtaining suitable labour. While overall wage costs remain contained at present, despite pressures in particular sectors, ongoing strength in demand would pose an increasing risk of acceleration of costs over time. ", " As has been clear in previous <em>Statements</em>, the Bank has judged the stance of monetary policy over the past several years to be expansionary when compared with relevant historical benchmarks. Both the cash rate and indicator rates of financial intermediaries have been at lower-than-average levels. It is clear, moreover, that borrowers in the private sector, and particularly households, have found it attractive to borrow at these rates of interest. The rate of growth of credit increased further in September, to be at an annual rate of 15 per cent over the latest six months; for credit to households, the corresponding figure is 22 per cent. ", " With the risks to the Australian economy from abroad abating further over recent months, and with signs that domestic growth was running faster than expected, the Board's deliberations turned to the question of how much longer such an expansionary stance of policy should be maintained. As discussed above, the outlook for inflation over the next year remains quite benign, due to the assumed effects of the higher exchange rate. But a rising exchange rate cannot be relied on to control inflation over the medium term; that requires domestic pressures to be properly contained. While at present those pressures appear manageable, over the medium term they are more likely to grow than to diminish in an economy growing faster than trend. In the mature stage of a long expansion, with less spare capacity than would have been the case some years ago, monetary policy needs to keep a close eye on future growth in demand. ", " A separate, but no less important issue, flagged repeatedly in previous <em>Statements</em>, is the rapid run-up in household debt. While this has been associated with a boost to domestic spending which was welcome in a weak international environment, such trends carry increasing risk if they persist over long periods. Those risks, discussed at length on other occasions and so not repeated here, appear to be growing. Monetary policy should, as far as possible, avoid adding to them. ", " Given all the above considerations, the Board judged at its November meeting that a firming in the stance of policy was appropriate, with the timing of such a change the main question. The Board took the view that the general macroeconomic case to move was quite clear, and that there was little to be gained by delaying action. Hence the cash rate was increased by 25 basis points in early November. Over the period ahead, the Board will continue to assess the changing balance of risks to the economic outlook and adjust the stance of policy as needed to foster sustained and balanced growth, consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. ", " Global economic conditions have improved over recent months, with stronger economic data emerging in the US, Japan and most other countries in east Asia, though the euro area remains weak. Consistent with these developments, forecasts for world growth have been revised upwards recently, particularly for the US and Japan <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 1)</span>. This follows a succession of downward revisions to growth in the first half of the year. In its latest assessment of the international outlook, released in September, the IMF forecasts that growth in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">G7 countries</span> will accelerate from 1.8 per cent in 2003 to 2.8 per cent in 2004 and, for the world as a whole, from 3.2 per cent to 4.1 per cent (Table 1). The latest private-sector Consensus forecasts, released in October, are slightly stronger than those of the IMF, reflecting the more recent positive news out of the US and Asia. ", " The pace of growth in the US has picked up over recent months, assisted by very expansionary macroeconomic policy settings and supportive financial conditions. In the September quarter, GDP increased by 1.7 per cent to be 3.3 per cent higher over the year (Graph 2, Table 2). While there is some uncertainty regarding the durability of the pick-up in growth, prospects look to be more positive than they have been for some time. In particular, the most recent data suggest that the headwinds that have retarded investment and employment growth over recent years may finally be dissipating. ", " The recent step-up in growth has been underpinned by strong household consumption, which rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span> in the September quarter, propelled by a sharp increase in disposable income flowing from recent fiscal initiatives. These initiatives, which include a lowering of marginal tax rates and an increase in the child care tax credit, should provide a further similar-sized boost to household income in the first half of 2004 when tax refunds are paid. Much of the strength in consumption has been concentrated in durable goods, consistent with robust residential investment. Also supporting household spending has been the growth in house prices over the past year or so which, combined with more recent increases in equity prices, has resulted in a solid rise in household wealth. ", " While the labour market remains weak, there are tentative signs that the stronger economic growth is beginning to have some impact. The payrolls measure of employment rose in September for the first time in eight months, while the alternative household survey measure of employment is slightly higher than a year ago. The unemployment rate has edged lower over the past few months to 6.1 per cent in September, and other indicators, such as new claims for unemployment benefits, are also showing signs of stronger labour demand. With production having run ahead of employment, it is likely that increased labour hiring will soon be required to facilitate the continued solid expansion of production. ", " The more positive signals about the labour market are also consistent with higher business confidence in recent months. Non-manufacturing businesses are reporting highly favourable trading conditions, while conditions in the manufacturing industry have also improved with both production and durable goods orders showing an upward trend. Also, given low inventory levels, it seems probable that increased demand will soon have to be met by higher production. Financial markets have responded to these developments, with the stock market well up from its recent trough in March. ", " Improved conditions in the business sector, including rising profitability and a more favourable environment for external funding, are spurring higher investment spending (Graph 3). Business investment expanded by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.7 per cent</span> in the September quarter, marking the second consecutive quarterly increase after a protracted period of decline. A further rise in spending on computer equipment and software drove rapid growth in equipment investment in the September quarter, which is now 6.0 per cent higher than a year ago, while structures investment fell slightly in the quarter. ", " Consumer price inflation edged up to 2.3 per cent over the year to September, largely reflecting higher energy costs; the core measure has eased further to a year-ended rate of 1.2 per cent. Overall, inflation remains low, owing to falling unit labour costs and subdued upstream price pressures. Given these disinflationary forces, the Fed has stated that monetary policy can remain accommodative for a ‘considerable period’. ", " More convincing signs have emerged in recent months that a cyclical upswing is underway in Japan. Output expanded by 1.0 per cent in the June quarter, with growth in real GDP now running at 3.0 per cent over the year. After an extended period in which the economy contracted in nominal terms, nominal GDP also rose slightly over the year (Graph 4). More recently, in September, industrial production rose strongly and is now 2.1 per cent higher than a year ago. ", " Aided by improved profitability, business investment has risen and machinery orders are well above levels of a year ago. To date, investment has been concentrated in the manufacturing sector, although in the September quarter Tankan survey, firms in non-manufacturing industries expressed positive investment intentions for the first time in five years. Exports have also shown healthy gains over the past year. Reflecting these positive developments, the Japanese stock market has risen by around 40 per cent over the past six months and long-term bond yields have risen by nearly 1 percentage point since the middle of the year. ", " While conditions in the services sector of the economy have remained subdued, the recovery in output growth has been associated with stabilisation of the labour market. Employment has been broadly unchanged over the past year, having fallen for much of the past six years, with the unemployment rate declining to 5.1 per cent by September – its lowest level in two years. The rate of decline in wages also appears to have slowed. ", " Notwithstanding stronger growth, Japan continues to experience deflation. This is most evident in the GDP deflator, which is 2.7 per cent lower over the year to the June quarter. Other measures of prices, however, suggest that the pace of deflation has eased in recent months. For example, core consumer prices fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.1 per cent</span> over the year to September, compared with deflation rates of around 1.0 per cent in the past few years, though an administered increase in medical costs and a rise in tobacco taxes account for some of the slowing in the rate of deflation. ", " While the current cyclical upswing will help to alleviate deflationary pressures in the short term, there remain ongoing structural concerns for the Japanese economy. The outstanding stock of non-performing loans remains high and bank lending continues to fall and is currently around 5 per cent lower than a year ago. ", " China continues to grow at a remarkably strong pace, with output increasing by 9.1 per cent over the year to the September quarter. With imports increasing by 40 per cent over the past year, and exports expanding only slightly less rapidly, the current pace of growth in China is providing impetus to activity in the region. ", " Activity in other parts of east Asia is bouncing back from the effects of SARS, which saw a sharp slump in tourist arrivals and undermined domestic spending with the result that output fell in many economies in the June quarter. This followed an already weak performance in the March quarter, due to subdued external demand and domestic-led weakness in Korea. By early July, however, the SARS outbreak had been contained and activity in the affected economies has rebounded in the September quarter; the initial estimate for Singapore shows GDP rising by around 3.6 per cent in the quarter to be 1.0 per cent higher over the year. International arrivals to the countries most affected by SARS have almost fully recovered and arrivals to the rest of the region have also risen, though remain below levels in much of 2002 (Graph 5). Industrial production and exports have increased strongly in the region, after weakening in the June quarter (Graph 6). ", " Along with the pick-up in activity, there are tentative signs that conditions are improving in labour markets across the region, with the unemployment rate declining slightly in a number of countries. These developments are yet to have much effect on consumer prices, with inflation remaining subdued in most countries. ", " As in Australia, domestic demand in New Zealand continues to grow at a strong pace while external demand remains quite weak. In the June quarter, GDP grew by 0.2 per cent to be 2.7 per cent higher over the year. Reflecting strength in much of the domestic economy, the unemployment rate continues to hover around record lows. This is placing some upward pressure on domestically sourced inflation, with the non-tradables component of the CPI rising by 4.1 per cent over the past year. House prices are also rising quickly, with the national measure climbing by 14 per cent over the year to the June quarter. Overall CPI inflation, however, remains at the lower end of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's 1–3 per cent target band, with the currency appreciation exerting a dampening influence. ", " In contrast to the recovery in most major regions of the world, the euro area remains conspicuously weak, although some recent developments suggest that a modest improvement is in prospect. GDP was flat in the March quarter, and contracted slightly in the June quarter to be only 0.2 per cent higher over the year (Table 3). Exports fell, weighed down by lacklustre external demand and the earlier appreciation of the euro, and consumption growth slowed. This weakness in euro area activity reflects falls in output in the three largest economies in the region. The weakest performer, though, has been the Netherlands where household consumption has fallen, hampered by low consumer confidence and the adjustment of household balance sheets after a decade of heavy borrowing (Graph 7). ", " Despite these poor outcomes in the first half of the year, there are some tentative signs that a modest recovery in the euro area may be underway. Industrial production and exports have risen in recent months and most measures of business confidence are considerably firmer than earlier in the year (Graph 8). There is yet, however, no firm evidence of a recovery in household demand, which remains sluggish even though consumer confidence has edged up from its recent lows. The unemployment rate for the euro area as a whole has risen from <span class=\"no-wrap\">8.0 per cent</span> in late 2001 to 8.8 per cent currently. ", " Consumer price inflation in the euro area increased to 2.1 per cent over the year to October, primarily due to higher food and energy prices; the core measure of inflation is lower at 1.7 per cent (Graph 9). The ECB has kept its policy rate unchanged since June, noting that the downside risks to economic growth had declined, but not ‘disappeared’. Furthermore, fiscal deficits have expanded considerably in recent years, with both Germany and France expected to post deficits exceeding 4 per cent of GDP this year, remaining well above the 3 per cent ceiling of the Stability and Growth Pact in both 2004 and 2005. ", " Growth in the UK has been picking up since the middle of the year, with this recovery now clearly evident in revised national accounts data. GDP grew by 0.6 per cent in the September quarter to be 1.9 per cent higher over the year. Household spending continues to grow solidly, supported by a relatively tight labour market, with the unemployment rate remaining at historically low levels. As in Australia, consumption has also been supported by rapid house price inflation, with prices rising by 16 per cent over the past year and doubling over the past five years. This has encouraged housing equity withdrawal, which amounted to 6 per cent of household disposable income in the June quarter (Graph 10). Retail price inflation in the UK continues to hold slightly above the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Bank of England's</span> 2.5 per cent target, coming in at 2.8 per cent over the year to September. ", " Sentiment in financial markets has continued to improve over the past three months, with bond yields in most major markets rising and equity markets rallying further. The mood in markets has keyed off growing evidence that a solid upswing in economic activity is underway in the US and Asia, and to a much smaller extent in Europe. ", " There have been no significant changes to monetary policy among overseas countries in the past three months although financial markets are suggesting that the next move in monetary policy in these countries is likely to be a tightening. This is seen as some way off in the larger countries, though perhaps imminent in some other developed economies. ", " Foreign exchange markets have been quite volatile over recent months, particularly around the September G7 meeting in Dubai when finance ministers issued a statement arguing that more flexibility in exchange rates was desirable. This was viewed by the market as a further softening in the ‘strong dollar’ stance of the US, as well as being directed at the Asian countries, particularly China and Japan, which had been intervening heavily to prevent their currencies rising against the US dollar. The US dollar has weakened significantly further on a trade-weighted basis. This has been one reason why the Australian dollar has risen substantially against the US dollar while being only modestly higher against most other G10 currencies and little changed against the Japanese yen. ", " The monetary policy easing cycle that involved many developed country central banks from mid 2002 to mid 2003 now appears to have largely run its course (Table 4). ", " The monetary authorities of the US and Japan have reiterated that monetary policy will remain accommodative for the foreseeable future as the excess capacity that has built up as a result of the earlier period of economic weakness is seen as limiting inflationary pressures for some time. As such, futures markets reflect no expectation of a policy change in these countries in the near future. The ECB has been less explicit, though the recovery in economic activity in the euro area has been somewhat weaker than in the US and Japan. Accordingly, while futures markets are suggesting that the next move from ECB will be a tightening in monetary policy, it is not priced in until mid 2004. ", " In the UK, however, markets see a high probability of an early tightening. These expectations were given further force when minutes of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee showed that it had voted only narrowly against raising policy rates at its October meeting. Expectations of monetary tightening in New Zealand also increased after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's October policy statement. ", " Among Asian emerging markets, Indonesia was the only country to lower official rates. Monetary policy in most other Asian countries remained stable after a series of SARS-related easings in the first half of the year. The one exception was China where the central bank increased its required reserve ratio for commercial banks by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage</span> point to 7 per cent, in an effort to curb rapid growth in credit. Brazil continued to lower rates towards more accommodative levels, as inflation abated and the real stabilised. ", " Bond yields in the major markets have risen substantially since mid year, when significant downside risks to world economic growth were seen by markets (Graph 11). In the US, 10-year bond yields are currently 4.4 per cent, around 120 basis points above the mid-June trough, reflecting the run of positive economic data in recent months. Selling of Treasury securities by holders of mortgage-related debt, in order to hedge their increasing interest-rate risk, remained a factor exerting upward pressure on yields. Working in the other direction, the investment of the US dollar proceeds of foreign exchange intervention by Asian central banks was supportive of the US Treasury market, as was the very wide spread between 10-year Treasury yields and the Fed funds rate, particularly in light of the Fed's reaffirmation of its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy <span class=\"no-wrap\">stance (Table 5, Graph 12)</span>. ", " Bond yields in Europe have increased by around 90 basis points since the middle of the year. This is less than the rise in US yields as economic data in the euro area have not shown the same improvement as in the US. Bond yields in Japan have increased by about 110 basis points since mid year, to 1.5 per cent. ", " Reflecting the ongoing improvement in investor sentiment and appetite for risk in global debt markets, corporate spreads have continued to fall over recent months. In the US, spreads are currently at levels well below those seen prior to the high-profile corporate collapses in 2002 (Graph 13). With spreads narrowing across the board, most corporate bond yields are below where they were at the beginning of the year and, in the case of lower-rated corporate bonds, are around their mid-June lows. ", " Spreads between emerging market sovereign debt and US Treasuries have also narrowed further over the past three months (Graph 14). This occurred despite a threatened default by Argentina when it missed a loan repayment to the IMF on 9 September. The payment was made a couple of days later, following provisional agreement on a new accord with the IMF to roll over US$12.5 billion in debt over three years as part of a revised programme for the country. In the same month, Argentina foreshadowed a restructuring offer that would return US25 cents in the dollar on the debt on which it had defaulted in 2001. ", " The general reduction in risk aversion has been complemented by a number of sovereign ratings upgrades. In the case of Asia, credit ratings for those countries hardest hit by the financial crisis of the late 1990s still remain below the ratings recorded immediately prior to the crisis (Table 6). The latest credit rating upgrade for Russia, however, means that its debt is now rated more highly than it was prior to the Russian debt crisis in 1998. ", " Like bond markets, equity markets have also responded to increasing optimism about the prospects for a global recovery, with the major markets extending the strong upward move that began in March. In the US, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">S&amp;P 500</span> has recovered by 31 per cent from its trough in March; the technology-focused NASDAQ has increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">54 per cent</span> over the same period, reflecting signs that the IT industry is recovering more rapidly than other sectors (Table 7). ", " The latest earnings guidance from US corporations presents a generally positive picture with both the <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘as reported’</span> and ‘operating’ measures of earnings improving in the September quarter. Nonetheless, in the case of a number of well-established US corporates, investors remain concerned about the extent of unfunded medical and pension liabilities and the equity prices of these firms have generally underperformed the overall market. In a couple of instances, such as US car manufacturers, these firms have experienced ratings downgrades or have been put under review for a possible downgrade. The S&amp;P 500 price-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at around 30, well above its long-run average (Graph 15). ", " European equity prices have also continued to rise with the increases since the March low a little stronger than those in the US market (Graph 16). In Japan, share prices have risen by a similar magnitude, with markets pleasantly surprised by the strength of economic data in Japan in recent months. ", " The improvement in the global economy has also flowed through to emerging market shares with both <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian and Latin American</span> share prices rising appreciably over the same period. Russian equity prices weakened towards the end of October following the arrest of the chief executive of Russia's largest oil company and the freezing of some of its shares. Nonetheless, Russian equity prices are still more than 50 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year. ", " In recent months, the US dollar has continued the decline that began in early 2002 (Graph 17). The fall accelerated after the mid-September release of a G7 Finance Ministers' statement which called for greater flexibility in exchange rates in the interests of promoting smooth and widespread adjustments in the international financial system. Markets interpreted this as a signal that the US authorities were no longer pursuing a <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘strong dollar’</span> policy – despite later statements to the contrary. The Japanese authorities slowed the very heavy intervention they had been undertaking in earlier months and the yen appreciated by as much as 8 per cent to 108 against the US dollar between end August and late October – its highest level for nearly three years – before weakening a little. The euro appreciated by 6 per cent against the US dollar over the same period and is now higher by 9 per cent this year. ", " The currencies of most other developed countries have also appreciated substantially against the US dollar in recent months, as they have generally tended to move in line with the euro. However, most emerging market currencies, particularly those in Asia, have maintained a close relationship with the US dollar. As such the US broad TWI fell by only about half as much as the fall against the major currencies (Graph 18). ", " The linking of Asian currencies to the US dollar has caused some consternation in both the US and Europe with the G7 statement being viewed by the market as a veiled attack on the exchange rate policies of a number of Asian countries. Over recent years countries in Asia have been intervening heavily (buying US dollars and selling their own currencies) in order to prevent an appreciation of their currencies. This has resulted in very large increase in their holdings of reserve assets (Graph 19). The accumulation of reserves has been particularly noticeable in China and Japan, and to a lesser extent, in Korea and Taiwan (Graph 20). Other measures, such as exchange controls, are also being used to stem the appreciation of local currencies, with the authorities in Thailand announcing in October a package of measures, including suspension of interest payments to overseas holders of Thai cheque and savings accounts and a deposit ceiling of 300 million baht (US$7.5 million) per account. ", " The focus on Asian currencies, and the renminbi in particular, has also reflected a steady increase in China's share of global export markets; over the past five years China's exports have increased by an average of 16 per cent per year. This means that China is now vying with Japan to be the third largest exporter globally, behind the United States and Germany (Graph 21). However, while China's exports are highly visible, its imports are also growing rapidly, meaning that it runs a relatively modest, and declining, trade surplus of around 2 per cent of GDP. ", " The Australian dollar recorded another strong rise over the period since the previous <em>Statement</em>, particularly against the US dollar which was weakening on global markets (Graph 22). The local currency was up by 8 per cent against the US dollar and about 7 per cent against the euro but flat against the Japanese yen. Against other <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian currencies</span> it was up by around 8 per cent, which was similar to the increase against the US dollar, given that these currencies have been largely moving with the US currency. Reflecting the significant weight Asian currencies have in the trade-weighted index of the Australian dollar, the index was up by 6 per cent over the period. ", " While the rise in the Australian dollar in recent weeks has been on a scale similar to that which took place in the second half of the June quarter, the circumstances driving it are very different. The June quarter rise was caused by very negative developments abroad, particularly concerns that other countries would lower interest rates much further in the face of weak economic activity. The latest rise, in contrast, reflects positive developments in the world economy and in Australia and is therefore more in keeping with current circumstances. The recent buying of the currency seems to have been underpinned by the strengthening in commodity prices, reflecting the sharp improvement in the market's view about world economic prospects. In other words, the market has gone back to a more traditional model of the Australian dollar, based on a commodity price story. Other currencies that have traditionally had a ‘commodity’ element (the Canadian dollar, NZ dollar and South African rand) have also risen strongly over the past couple of months. Demand for Australian dollars by Japanese retail investors through the <span class=\"no-wrap\">A$ Uridashi</span> bond market has eased back from the very high levels earlier in the year, though it remains significant <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 23)</span>. ", " Resource company hedging levels, as recorded in the NAB quarterly business survey, have remained fairly steady this year at around 25–30 per cent of exposures (Table 8). The larger diversified resource companies tend not to be active in hedging their revenues, relying instead on the natural hedge achieved through having operations in a wide range of countries and exposure to a mix of commodities. ", " Over the past year the Australian dollar is up by 26 per cent against the US dollar and about 10 per cent against the euro (Table 9). Gains against most other floating currencies have also been limited, though those against most Asian currencies have been similar to that against the US dollar. As noted, Asian currencies are important in the TWI and the appreciation against these currencies accounts for about two-thirds of the 18 per cent rise in the TWI over the past year. ", " The Australian dollar in trade-weighted terms is currently about 7 per cent above its post-float average. However, this masks some divergent trends. Against the G10 currencies, the Australian dollar is still on average about <span class=\"no-wrap\">8 per cent</span> below its post-float average (Graph 24). In contrast, against the currencies of non-Japan Asia the Australian dollar is about 35 per cent above its post-float average. ", " The RBA continued to rebuild its foreign currency reserves by making purchases in excess of the Government's requirements. In the three months to October, net purchases amounted to $2.0 billion, while earnings on reserves added another $40 million. The market value of net reserves at end October stood at $15.5 billion, up from $13.2 billion at the start of the financial year. The Bank also made substantial use of foreign exchange swaps during the past few months to manage domestic liquidity, though in net terms the swap position (at $30.1 billion) has not changed much since the start of the financial year. Total reserve holdings (i.e. reserves held outright plus reserves held under swap agreements) stood at $45.5 billion at end October. ", " The pace of growth of the Australian economy has picked up since mid year. This improvement has been underpinned by a stronger international climate and improved conditions in the rural sector. Domestic demand growth has also shown signs of renewed strength. Both consumer and business confidence are at high levels and the outlook for business investment remains positive. Recent data on the housing sector have also been stronger than expected. ", " The impact of the weak world economy and the drought over the first half of 2003 are evident in the latest national accounts, which show that real GDP rose by 0.1 per cent in the June quarter and 2.0 per cent over the year (Table 10). This outcome reflects strongly contrasting performances of the domestic and external sectors. In particular, domestic demand grew by almost 5 per cent over the year to the June quarter, although the pace of growth slowed over the first half of 2003. In contrast, exports fell by around 5 per cent over the year, with net exports subtracting 3.5 percentage points from overall growth (Graph 25). The contrasting performance of different sectors of the economy is also evident in the fact that farm GDP fell by 32 per cent over the year to the June quarter, while non-farm GDP rose by 3.4 per cent. ", " Looking forward, stronger and more balanced growth is expected. A recovery in exports appears to be underway and, as a result, net exports are expected to make a small positive contribution to growth over the coming year. Domestic demand is expected to continue to grow solidly, buoyed by strong growth in consumption. Indicators of investment intentions and of the amount of work in the pipeline suggest that growth in business investment should remain above its long-term average, and the outlook for dwelling investment now looks to be considerably stronger than was the case earlier in the year. ", " Household consumption has grown solidly over the past year, with recent indicators suggesting considerable ongoing strength. Growth has been underpinned by a number of factors, including a high level of consumer confidence, a decline in the unemployment rate, favourable financial conditions and increases in wealth, fostered by rising housing prices. ", " In the June quarter, consumption rose by 1.2 per cent to be 3.6 per cent higher than a year earlier. Unlike the usual situation in which consumption of services grows more quickly than goods, the past few years have seen this pattern reverse (Graph 26). This is largely explained by two factors. The first is the very strong growth in purchases of motor vehicles, partly in response to a decline in prices. And the second is the high level of housing investment, which has contributed to rapid growth in purchases of housing-related items. Over the past two years, for example, expenditure on furnishings has increased by an average of 8 per cent per year, around twice the average rate of the past decade. ", " Recent indicators of consumption suggest that the strength in consumer spending seen earlier in the year has picked up over recent months. The volume of retail sales increased by 2.7 per cent in the September quarter, to be 5.4 per cent higher over the year, with sales of passenger vehicles also rising strongly in the quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">14.1 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier (Graph 27). The level of consumer confidence has also risen to its highest level in almost a decade. ", " An important factor supporting consumption has been the strong gains in wealth arising mainly from higher house prices. Over the past year, the value of the household sector's assets have increased by around 17 per cent, bringing the cumulative increase over the past three years to 43 per cent. Partly because of these significant gains, consumption has risen faster than household disposable income over this period, and there has been a corresponding fall in the saving ratio. Over recent quarters, this fall has been compounded by the weakness in farm incomes. ", " While household assets are rising strongly, households continue to accumulate debt at a rapid pace. Household credit grew by 5½ per cent over the three months to September and by 21 per cent over the year. While most of this borrowing has been used to finance the acquisition of dwellings, including by investors, households have also increased their borrowing to finance consumption. This is evident in the strong growth in personal credit over the six months to September and the rapid pace of growth in revolving credit secured against residential mortgages. More broadly, the household sector continues to withdraw housing equity to finance non-housing activities. In the June quarter, the overall rise in housing-secured credit exceeded dwelling investment by the equivalent of 8 per cent of household disposable income, which is almost twice the average magnitude of housing equity withdrawal seen over the past two years (Graph 28). ", " The expansion of household debt has meant that the debt-servicing ratio – the ratio of interest payments to disposable income – has increased further over the past year (Graph 29). Mortgage interest costs now represent 6½ per cent of aggregate household disposable income, a level that exceeds its previous peaks. Including interest on other forms of household borrowing, total interest costs now stand close to 8 per cent of household income. Although this ratio remains below the peak reached at the end of the 1980s boom, a continuation of current rates of credit growth would see the late-1980s peak exceeded sometime in 2004. This is notwithstanding the fact that in the late 1980s interest rates were at much higher levels than they are at present, and a greater proportion of household debt was in the form of more costly personal loans rather than mortgages. ", " After peaking at around historically high levels in late 2002, housing construction activity declined slightly in the first half of 2003. Recent strength in leading indicators, however, suggests that contrary to earlier expectations, the level of activity is likely to recover in coming quarters. The cyclical downturn anticipated at the beginning of the year appears to have been remarkably modest in comparison with previous housing cycles. ", " Dwelling investment declined by 4½ per cent over the first half of 2003, with most of this decline occurring in the June quarter. This follows a period of very strong increases, which saw dwelling investment contribute over a percentage point to annual growth in GDP in 2002. ", " The recent fall in new dwelling construction reflects a decline in the construction of new houses, while activity in the medium-density sector increased strongly over the first half of the year. This pattern is expected to be reversed somewhat over the second half of the year, as activity in the house-building sector begins to pick up and growth moderates in the medium-density sector. Overall, new residential construction is likely to recover from the recent falls before stabilising in 2004. ", " This assessment is supported by leading indicators of housing demand. The number of building approvals for detached houses has remained at a high level in recent months, following the sharp rise recorded around the middle of the year (Graph 30). Display-home traffic and land sale enquiries are also showing signs of renewed strength. In addition, renovation activity has been stronger recently, with building approvals for alterations and additions having risen by around 13 per cent in the September quarter and lending for this purpose also growing rapidly in recent months. ", " Building approvals in the volatile medium-density sector fell by around 25 per cent in the first half of the year, but showed renewed strength in the September quarter. Despite the pronounced fall in approvals in the first half of the year, the level of activity is not expected to decline in the second half of 2003 given the large amount of work still in the construction pipeline. Beyond this, declines in medium-density approvals may be in prospect, with housing bodies reporting that sales of new apartments have fallen to around half their peak in late 2001. Another factor likely to constrain new development is that the supply of apartments coming onto the market is expected to increase significantly over the next few quarters, given that commencements have been running well ahead of completions since early 2002. This is likely to add to the oversupply in some inner-city markets. ", " Overall, the current level of building approvals is broadly in line with most analysts' estimates of underlying requirements for new housing. Stronger population growth, faster household-formation rates and an apparent increase in the rate of demolitions have all contributed to a somewhat higher estimated level of underlying demand for new housing over the past five years. This strength is a key factor underpinning the medium-term outlook for residential construction. ", " Housing credit continues to grow at a rapid rate. Over the three months to September it increased at an annualised rate of 25 per cent, compared with growth of around 21 per cent over the previous three-month period. Furthermore, new loan approvals continue to increase strongly and are at a very high level (Graph 31). Over the past three months, the value of total loan approvals has risen by 12 per cent to be 31 per cent higher than a year earlier. Approvals for loans to investors have been particularly strong, rising by almost 40 per cent over the past year; these now account for a record high 43 per cent of total approvals. Given the strong growth in approvals, there is little prospect that the rate of housing credit growth will slow in the short term. ", " The rapid credit growth for housing has been associated with strong gains in housing prices. According to the ABS measure, prices rose, on average, by 5 per cent in the June quarter to be 18 per cent higher over the year, with strong gains being recorded in all major capital cities (Graph 32). The limited data available for the September quarter suggest that strong price rises have persisted into the second half of 2003. According to data from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, established house prices grew by 9.1 per cent in the September quarter, to be almost 29 per cent higher over the year. ", " Apartment prices, on average, also continue to rise rapidly, though at a slower pace than house prices. There is, however, evidence of weakness in apartment prices in the inner-city areas of Sydney and Melbourne where strong investor demand over recent years has contributed to a large increase in supply. Data from Australian Property Monitors show that inner-city apartment prices in Melbourne have fallen by around 4 per cent from their peak, while prices in Sydney have fallen by about the same amount over the two quarters to June, though they remain 8 per cent higher over the year. There is no evidence at this stage that this weakness is spreading to apartment prices more broadly. ", " In contrast to prices, apartment rents have shown little or no growth over recent years. Rents in inner Melbourne, where concerns about oversupply have been most pronounced, have declined considerably over the past year, while rents in inner Sydney have been broadly flat for some time (Graph 33). In those markets where rents have been rising, the increases have fallen well short of the increases in prices, leading to a further decline in rental yields. These yields are now very low by historical standards and in comparison with yields in other countries. ", " Conditions for many businesses have picked up over recent months, with measures of confidence improving in line with signs of renewed strength in the domestic and world economies. The general improvement comes after a year in which there were marked divergences in the performance of different sectors of the economy. For the year to June, output growth was strongest in those areas with greater exposure to the domestic economy, most notably in the construction and finance sectors (Graph 34). In contrast, a large contraction was experienced by the farm sector. Conditions were also weak in the mining sector and those parts of manufacturing oriented to export markets. ", " Looking forward, a more balanced growth profile is expected. As drought conditions have eased in most parts of the country, strong growth in farm production is likely to be recorded in the September quarter. The ABS is currently projecting an increase in production of nearly 40 per cent over the year to June 2004 (and a 28 per cent rise in 2003/04 as a whole), due almost entirely to a rebound in winter crop production (Graph 35). Prospects for irrigated crops and most livestock-related production, however, remain subdued (see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A: The Recovery from the Drought</a>’ for further details). The brighter outlook for the global economy should help the mining sector, as well as tourism-related services (where recovery from SARS is already evident). ", " Business surveys confirm a significant improvement in business conditions over recent months. Most measures of confidence are now well above their long-run average levels and consistent with strong growth in domestic demand (Graph 36). The NAB survey of the non-farm sector, for example, reported that business conditions and confidence in the September quarter were at their highest levels since 1994. The recent improvement has been broadly based, with firms in all states and across most industries reporting better conditions than in the first half of the year; conditions are especially favourable in sectors with significant exposure to the domestic economy. Similarly, the ACCI-Westpac composite index of expectations for activity, comprising survey measures of employment, new orders, output and overtime, has recently risen to the highest level in the 35-year history of the series (Graph 37). The Australian Industry Group (AIG) survey of manufacturing also reported improved conditions, particularly for firms exposed to the housing sector, while in contrast, export-oriented manufacturing firms reported relatively weak conditions. ", " The level of profits relative to GDP remains high, although the slowdown in economic growth in the first <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of 2003</span> has been associated with a slowdown in the rate of profit growth (Graph 38). In recent quarters, weakness in external demand and the adverse effects of the exchange rate appreciation on foreign-currency income have led to an overall decline in profits in the manufacturing and mining sectors, while farm-sector profits have also fallen owing to the continuing effects of the drought. In contrast, profitability has remained relatively strong in the construction, retail and wholesale trade sectors. Looking ahead to the second half of 2003, farm profitability is expected to recover in line with improved conditions in this sector. More broadly, the NAB business survey suggests that non-farm profitability has picked up considerably in the second half of 2003. ", " Generally healthy profits have meant that many firms have been able to continue to rely on internal funding to finance investment. Nevertheless, borrowing from financial intermediaries has picked up recently, rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">7 per cent</span> in annualised terms over the six months to September. In contrast, equity raisings by non-financial companies have recently been below the average level of the past few years, although a number of companies are expected to float in coming months. Overall, businesses do not appear to be constrained in obtaining finance. Corporate gearing ratios remain conservative, which together with low interest rates, has meant that interest payments by firms have remained at relatively low levels. ", " The outlook for business investment is positive, given the ready access to internal and external funding, the high levels of capacity utilisation and the high level of business confidence. This positive outlook comes after business investment rose by 13 per cent over the year to the June quarter, although by only 1 per cent in the June quarter itself (Graph 39). Machinery and equipment investment underpinned the positive quarterly outcome, increasing by 2 per cent. In contrast, buildings and structures investment was flat, following six consecutive quarters of remarkably strong growth, while spending on computer software fell for a second consecutive quarter. ", " Indicators of investment intentions point to continued healthy growth in business investment, but at a more moderate pace than the rapid rate of the past year. The June quarter ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey points to solid growth of machinery and equipment investment in real terms in 2003/04, although in nominal terms, investment is expected to fall by 3 per cent (assuming a five-year average realisation ratio), reflecting lower prices for investment goods. The mining sector is expected to make a sizeable contribution to equipment investment – nominal spending here is projected to rise by 7 per cent. Nominal equipment investment is also expected to increase substantially in the finance and insurance, property and business services, and utilities industries, but fall in most other industries, most notably in the communications sector. ", " Forward-looking indicators of buildings and structures investment point to strong growth in coming quarters <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 40)</span>. Engineering construction has risen by 36 per cent over the past year and the unprecedented amount of work yet to be done suggests further expansion in the next few quarters. Non-residential building activity is expected to remain strong; work yet to be done has risen by 32 per cent over the past year and approvals continue to hold at very high levels, exceeding work done in recent quarters. The outlook, however, varies significantly across sectors. Conditions in the office market continued to be soft over the first half of the year, with the national vacancy rate rising and effective office rents declining. In contrast, demand for retail and industrial property has been strong, with further gains in rents and industrial property capital values. ", " The level of recorded employment has increased strongly over recent months, after declining earlier in the year. In the three months to October, the average level of employment was 2.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Looking through the monthly volatility, employment appears to have grown at slightly above its trend rate over the past year (Graph 41). ", " Over recent months the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 per cent, after it had moved in a narrow band of between 6 and 6¼ per cent for most of the past year. This suggests that the labour market is relatively tight. At its current level, the unemployment rate is equal to the low point of the late 1980s, and within ¼ percentage point of the lowest level of the past 25 years (Graph 42). ", " The gains in employment over the past year have occurred in all states, and those states with the highest unemployment rates in the three months to October 2002 have experienced the strongest growth and the largest declines in the unemployment rate (Table 11). As a result of this convergence, the unemployment rate is now below 7 per cent in all states for the first time since the 1970s. ", " Reflecting the pattern of output growth, employment growth has been strongest in the construction sector, where employment in the September quarter was 11.5 per cent higher than its level a year ago. In contrast, agricultural employment has fallen by 4.9 per cent over the past year (Table 12). ", " Looking forward, recent job vacancy and hiring intentions data point to continued solid employment growth over the remainder of the year and into 2004, with print- and internet-based indicators of labour demand improving over recent months, following weakness over the first half of the year (Graph 43). Business surveys are also pointing to strong employment growth. The NAB survey of employment intentions for the quarter ahead is at its highest level in almost a decade, while the ACCI-Westpac survey is also near a decade high. In contrast, the ABS job vacancies measure has fallen in each of the past two quarters, although it remains above the average seen since 1990. ", " Weak growth in the world economy and the drought in Australia have seen export earnings decline over the past couple of years (Graph 44). At the same time, robust growth in domestic demand has underpinned strong growth in the volume of imports. The result has been a substantial widening of the deficit on trade in goods and services. In the September quarter, this deficit stood at around 3 per cent of GDP, somewhat smaller than in the previous quarter, but still around 2 percentage points larger than the average over the past decade. Correspondingly, the current account deficit has also widened over the past couple of years, although the deficit for the September quarter, at around 6 per cent of GDP (assuming that the net income deficit remains constant as a share of GDP), is likely to have been smaller than in the previous quarter. ", " While exports have been weak for some time, there have been tentative signs of a recovery over recent months. This recovery is most evident in earnings from service exports, which rebounded strongly in the September quarter, to be about 3½ per cent higher than the average level since the 2000 Sydney Olympics (Graph 45). This rebound reflects a general recovery in international travel following the containment of SARS, with the number of short-term visitor arrivals in September the highest in over two years and well above the level recorded prior to the war in Iraq and the SARS outbreak (Graph 46). Arrivals are currently being boosted by the Rugby World Cup, which should see a further pick-up in service exports in the December quarter. ", " The outlook for the rural sector has also improved over recent months. This follows a period in which rural export earnings were adversely affected by drought, falling by almost 30 per cent since mid 2002. Crop production, particularly wheat, is expected to drive the recovery in exports in 2003/04, although a substantial pick-up will not be evident until the December quarter, when the bulk of the winter crop harvest occurs. In contrast, meat and live animal exports are expected to fall in the near term, as farmers have begun to re-stock herds and flocks now that pasture conditions have improved (see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A: The Recovery from the Drought</a>’ for further details). ", " As with rural exports, proceeds from resource exports have been weak over recent quarters, with export earnings falling by around 3 per cent in the September quarter and by around 12½ per cent over the past year. This decline reflects both the general weakness in the world economy and the appreciation of the Australian dollar over the period. The run of recent monthly data, however, suggests that earnings from resource exports have passed their trough. Global demand for resources is improving, with industrial production growing strongly in China and economic growth picking up in other regions, particularly the US and Japan. Although capacity constraints are an issue in some parts of the resources sector, they are expected to ease in time, given the high level of investment intentions in the mining sector (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic Conditions</a>’). ", " Manufactured export values have been broadly flat over the past two years, in contrast to average annual growth of over 10 per cent in the 1990s. As with resource exports, weak world demand and lower Australian dollar prices have both played a role. However, volumes are estimated to be moderately higher in the September quarter than a year earlier and the pick-up in world growth should see a recovery in manufactured exports. ", " Overall, export earnings rose by around 1½ per cent in the September quarter, driven by the services component, but were still about 8½ per cent lower than a year ago. The recent downward trend in export volumes has been much less pronounced than that in export values. The latest monthly data suggest that export volumes are picking up; over the past two months the value of exports has increased by 5½ per cent, despite lower Australian dollar prices (Graph 47). Moreover, exporters report generally positive expectations about growth in overseas demand in the period ahead. ", " In contrast to exports, import volumes have grown solidly over the past two years, due to robust growth in domestic demand. The pace of growth moderated in early 2003, however, in line with the easing in the rate of growth of domestic spending and the dropping-out of one-off factors such as large purchases of civil aircraft. The volume of imports rose by 2¼ per cent in the June quarter, which is a little above trend rates, and is likely to record a similar increase in the September quarter. In value terms, though, imports have fallen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5¾ per cent</span> since the end of 2002, reflecting a substantial fall in import prices due to the Australian dollar's appreciation. ", " The net income deficit has remained around 3 per cent of GDP over the past four years, which is lower than the average for the 1990s. While falling world interest rates have reduced the servicing cost of foreign debt over the past two years, this has been offset by rising dividend payments on foreign holdings of Australian equity, reflecting the strong profit growth of Australian companies throughout this period. ", " The RBA Commodity Price Index rose by 4.3 per cent in SDR terms in the three months to October, driven by rises in the prices of rural goods and base metals, to be 1.7 per cent higher than a year ago (Graph 48). Even though the Australian dollar has appreciated, the RBA Commodity Price Index in A$ terms remains slightly above its average over the past 10 years. ", " Beef prices increased by 12 per cent in SDR terms in the three months to October, as demand in the US recovered from earlier weakness. Supply has also been constrained by herd rebuilding in Australia and the US, following the easing in drought conditions in both countries. The price of wheat has risen by 8½ per cent in the past three months, as adverse weather conditions in Europe have reduced the expected size of the world wheat crop for 2003/04. Despite the rise, the price of wheat is still well below the level of a year ago, when drought conditions were adversely affecting production in Australia, the US and Canada. ", " Base metals prices have increased steadily over the second half of 2003, in line with the brightening outlook for world industrial production and robust demand from China, in particular. Nickel prices rose sharply in the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">three months;</span> low stocks and a 13-week strike at a Canadian nickel producer provided additional support to prices. The prices of other resource commodities also rose moderately in the three months to October. The increase in the price of gold was particularly marked, at 5 per cent in the three-month period and 11 per cent over the year. ", " In the three months to October, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price averaged US$30 per barrel, largely unchanged from the previous three months (Graph 49). The OPEC basket of oil prices has now averaged above the US$25 midpoint of OPEC's target range for almost a year. After declining over the first half of September as US inventories increased and US demand eased, prices rose following OPEC's unexpected decision to reduce oil production quotas by around 3½ per cent, effective from November. The new production target is the same as that prevailing prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq. This follows increased production by non-OPEC members and a build-up of inventories, as well as some recovery in Iraq's oil production. ", " Overall, world prices for many of the commodities that Australia exports have held fairly steady over the past few years, despite the weakness in the world economy. In contrast, world prices of manufactured goods, which Australia predominantly imports, have generally been under downward pressure, reflecting the ongoing declines in the prices of information-technology products and the rapid expansion of productive capacity in Asia, especially China. The result has been an increase in Australia's terms of trade, including a 2 per cent rise over the first half of 2003, to its highest level since the late 1980s (Graph 50). A further increase is likely in the September quarter. ", " The target cash rate was raised from 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent following the November meeting of the Board. This was the first adjustment to the target since June of last year. While the tightening occurred slightly sooner than expected by many commentators and market participants, expectations of a tightening had been building since the last <em>Statement</em> in response to the continued strong performance of the local economy and a more optimistic tone in overseas markets. This was reflected in increases in short-term market yields over the period. Yields on 90-day bank bills had risen by around 25 basis points ahead of the change in the target and rose further after, indicating expectations of some further tightening of policy in the months ahead (Graph 51). ", " Long-term government bond yields have also risen since the release of the last <em>Statement</em> (Graph 52). Yields on 10-year bonds are currently around 5.90 per cent, which is back around the levels of a year ago after the sharp dip in the first half of 2003. ", " Like nominal yields, indexed bond yields have recorded a net increase over recent months. Ten-year real yields now stand at 3.6 per cent, around 25 basis points above their level in early August. ", " The yield curve has changed markedly in shape over the past few months (Graph 53). At the height of the pessimism about the world economy in June, 2-year yields were 70 basis points below the cash rate, and even 10-year yields were about 15 points below the cash rate, indicating the market expected that domestic interest rates might need to be cut in response to the external weakness. A lot of this pessimism had already been reversed by the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> in August, but since then yields have risen by a further <span class=\"no-wrap\">45–85 basis points</span> across the yield curve, as market confidence has improved. ", " Spreads between yields on highly-rated corporate bonds and government bonds rose slightly over the past three months (Graph 54). In contrast, there has been a narrowing in spreads on lower-rated bonds. Spreads on bonds rated BBB are now about 40 basis points below their peak seen a year ago, suggesting investors have become more confident about corporate credit worthiness. ", " Indicator rates on variable-rate housing and business loans were unchanged between mid 2002 and early November. While some mortgage managers and small lenders have raised rates, at the time of writing most financial institutions had not yet responded to the November policy tightening. For most of the period between the mid 2002 and November 2003 tightenings, fixed rates steadily declined, reaching a trough in June 2003. At that point they were well below rates on variable-rate loans. Recently, however, fixed rates offered by intermediaries have been rising again due to rises in banks' funding costs in capital markets. Since the last <em>Statement</em>, 3-year fixed rates on business loans have risen by 70 basis points while those on housing loans have risen by around 60 basis points. Three-year fixed rates on housing loans are currently around the same as those on variable-rate housing loans (Graph 55). ", " Despite the increase in fixed housing rates, the share of new loans taken out at fixed rates has risen, suggesting that borrowers had factored in some likelihood of an increase in variable interest rates. The share of fixed-rate loans, nonetheless, remains low relative to that seen for most of the 1990s. ", " The Australian share market has risen by 4 per cent since the last <em>Statement</em> to be 20 per cent above its mid-March low. In recent months, the Australian share market has performed broadly in line with the US share market <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 56)</span>. Further comparisons of Australian and US share returns are given in <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>. ", " The rise in Australian share prices over the past three months has been broadly based, with most sectors experiencing gains (Graph 57). Cyclical sectors – i.e. those most responsive to the economy – have performed particularly well. The materials sector has recorded very strong gains, reaching a new record high in mid October, buoyed by rising metals prices and increased optimism that demand for exports will increase as the global economy recovers. The consumer discretionary sector has also outperformed. The financials sector has fallen marginally, with a rise in insurers' share prices offset by falling equity prices for banks. The gains in the former reflect a 34 per cent jump in AMP's share price since the end of July. ", " Most companies in the ASX 200 have reported either annual or interim profit results in recent months. Aggregate net profits for the first half of 2003 were 10 per cent higher than those reported in the same period last year, excluding News Corporation and AMP whose profits have been affected by special factors. (News Corporation reported an $11 billion loss in the six months to June 2002, reflecting write-offs, while AMP reported a record loss of more than $2 billion for the first half of this year.) The telecommunications sector recorded particularly strong growth in net profits, with Telstra reporting an increase of 44 per cent on the same period last year. Profit results were also strong in the financials (excluding AMP) and materials sectors. ", " Overall, the market viewed the reporting season as successful, with a majority of companies meeting or exceeding analysts' most recent forecasts. Despite the strong result in the latest half year, weakness in the previous half meant that net profits for the year to June 2003 were around 1½ per cent lower than in the year to June 2002. The stronger results for the latest half year have led analysts to revise upwards their forecasts for 2003/04 earnings per share. ", " The Australian price-earnings (P/E) ratio has remained around 20 in recent months, above its long-run average but still well below the US P/E ratio (Graph 58). ", " Australian non-government entities were again active in bond issuance in the September quarter, with record activity in the domestic market and continued strong issuance into offshore markets (Table 13). ", " Total bond issuance by Australian non-government entities amounted to $33 billion in the September quarter, in line with the June quarter and well ahead of the quarterly rate in 2002. Asset-backed vehicles issued $17 billion, double their issuance in the June quarter and split fairly evenly between the domestic and offshore markets. Most asset-backed issues were backed by residential mortgages, reflecting continued rapid growth in housing finance. ", " Issuance by financial institutions eased in the September quarter, reflecting larger-than-initially planned issuance during the first half of 2003 (because of oversubscriptions) and increased issuance of hybrid and asset-backed securities. Financial institutions' bond issuance returned to more normal levels in October, but most issuance was into offshore markets. ", " At around two-thirds, the share of Australian entities' issuance that went into offshore markets was noticeably lower than in the first half of 2003, when offshore issuance was particularly strong, but broadly consistent with its average of the previous two years. ", " Most offshore issuance by Australian borrowers in the September quarter was denominated in foreign currencies (with companies typically using swap markets to hedge the proceeds back to Australian dollars). At just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 per cent</span>, the share of foreign currency issuance denominated in US dollars was below past norms; financial institutions issued substantial amounts in euros and pounds sterling. ", " Non-residents issued a total of $6.3 billion of Australian dollar denominated debt in the September quarter, with issuance fairly evenly divided between domestic and offshore markets. European and US financial institutions accounted for most of the strong domestic issuance, taking advantage of a narrowing in cross-currency interest rate swap spreads to diversify their funding sources at a globally competitive cost. ", " Even after record-level maturities in the September quarter, gross issuance of non-government debt into the domestic market was sufficient to see the stock of such debt outstanding rise to $134 billion by end September <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graphs 59 and 60)</span>. In contrast, Commonwealth Government bonds fell to $52 billion due to a large maturity while state government bonds outstanding declined slightly. ", " The ongoing process of product innovation in the domestic market was marked by two more developments last quarter. The first was the issue of an asset-backed bond backed entirely by low-documentation mortgages. These bonds were used to fund specialist ‘non-conforming’ lenders that have entered the Australian market in the past two years. The second was the introduction of several high-yielding portfolio credit-linked notes that were targeted at retail investors.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> The marketing of these products to retail investors contrasts with practices seen in the US and European markets, where these securities are primarily sold to institutional investors. ", " Issuance of hybrid securities (securities which are a mixture of both debt and equity) reached a record $4.7 billion in the September quarter, mostly in offshore markets (Graph 61). The major banks dominated hybrid issuance, issuing securities in Australia, the United States, and for the first time, the United Kingdom. ", " The growth rate of total credit has increased further in recent months – to an annualised rate of 15.2 per cent over the six months to September – with household credit growth picking up from already high levels and stronger growth in business credit (Graph 62). ", " Household credit growth continues to be driven by borrowing for housing, though personal credit has also grown strongly over recent months. Growth in housing credit rose slightly in the past few months and is now running at an annualised pace of around 23 per cent over the six months to September. Within this, borrowing by investors has been particularly strong, increasing by 33 per cent in annualised terms over the same period. ", " Business credit growth has also picked up since the middle of the year to an annualised rate of 6.8 per cent over the six months to September, more than double the rate over the six months to May. This was mainly attributable to commercial loans to private trading corporations and unincorporated businesses, while issuance of bank bills (also included in business credit) has been more modest in recent months. ", " On the liability side of intermediaries' balance sheets, growth in the broader monetary aggregates has been lower in recent months, with annualised growth in broad money of 10.5 per cent over the six months to September, compared with growth of 14.3 per cent over the six months to May (Graph 63). The divergence between growth of credit and broad money over the year reflects financial institutions accessing funding sources, such as offshore borrowing, which are not included in broad money. ", " Aggregate equity raisings in the September quarter were in line with average issuance of the past few years, with net issuance totalling $4 billion. While raisings by non-financial companies have recently been below past years' averages, raisings by financial companies have been particularly strong. Secondary raisings dominated, especially placements by non-financial companies and financial companies' raisings through dividend reinvestment plans. There was very little capital raised through new listings. ", " Financial conditions in Australia have been expansionary for some time. This has been most evident in the continuing rapid rate of credit expansion and the below-average level of interest rates. ", " At its November meeting, the Reserve Bank Board judged that it was appropriate to tighten financial conditions. As a result, the target cash rate was increased by 25 basis points to 5.0 per cent, having been unchanged since June 2002 (Graph 64). ", " Following the increase in the cash rate, a number of smaller lenders announced increases in their variable lending rates, though, at the time of writing, most large lenders had not adjusted rates. Notwithstanding the increases seen, variable lending rates remain low by historical standards. Fixed lending rates on housing and business loans have also risen over recent months in response to higher bond yields, although they too remain below the average of the past decade. ", " Real interest rates also remain low by historical standards, given that most measures of inflation expectations have been relatively stable over recent years. Another indicator of financial conditions is the slope of the yield curve, as measured by the spread between the yield on 10-year bonds and the target cash rate. This spread is slightly higher than it was at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>, though still below its average since the mid 1990s <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 65)</span>. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’, credit has continued to grow strongly, increasing by 4.4 per cent over the past three months and by 13.6 per cent over the past year. The strong growth reflects a rapid increase in borrowing by the household sector, most of it in the form of housing credit. Looking forward, there is little evidence to suggest that the rate of credit growth is likely to slow in the near term, with new loan approvals for housing having increased by 24 per cent over the six months to August. Financial institutions continue to compete aggressively for housing loans and there is a steady stream of innovative and more flexible loan products being introduced to the market. Despite some financial institutions having reportedly tightened their credit standards for loans to investors in inner-city apartments, housing credit remains readily available to both investors and owner-occupiers. ", " The strong growth in housing credit over recent years has been associated with rapid increases in housing prices. The resulting improvement in balance sheets of existing owners has added to the generally favourable financial conditions experienced by many households. As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic  Conditions</a>’, the wealth effects associated with rising housing prices have supported domestic consumption. ", " As was noted in the previous <em>Statement</em>, the current pace of household credit growth in Australia is high, relative to both the past and the experience of most other developed economies. Annual growth in household credit in Australia has exceeded growth in nominal GDP by an average of 8½ percentage points since the mid 1990s and currently exceeds nominal GDP growth by around 15 percentage points (Graph 66). ", " For businesses, financial conditions also continue to be quite favourable. Reflecting improved prospects for the global economy and ongoing strength in the domestic economy, the ASX 200 has increased by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> from its mid-March trough. Business credit growth has also picked up modestly over recent months, although with generally healthy profit growth, many firms are still able to rely on internal funding to finance expansion plans. Few firms report interest rates or access to finance as being significant constraints on investment. Corporate bond spreads have moved lower over the past six months to around five-year lows, suggesting that concerns over credit quality are not hampering access to external funding. ", " As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International  and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar has appreciated in trade-weighted terms by around 6 per cent over the past three months and 18 per cent over the year. This follows a period during which the real exchange rate was well below its average value for the <span class=\"no-wrap\">post-float</span> period (Graph 67). Other things equal, the appreciation represents a tightening of financial conditions for firms in the traded sector of the economy, but it has occurred against the backdrop of a steady rise in the terms of trade and, over recent months, a brighter outlook for the world economy. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.6 per cent in the September quarter to be 2.6 per cent higher over the year. This represents a small decline in year-ended inflation from the June quarter, and a more sizeable drop from an average inflation rate of around 3 per cent during 2002 (Graph 68). According to the various measures, underlying inflation was between 0.4 and 0.7 per cent in the September quarter (Table 14, Graph 69). Over the year, most measures show underlying inflation of around 2¾ per cent, with the main exception being the <em>market goods and services excluding volatile items</em> measure, which shows underlying inflation of 2 per cent. Overall, the Bank's assessment remains that, in year-ended terms, underlying inflation is running at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¾ per cent</span>. ", " Movements in the exchange rate have had an important influence on inflation outcomes recently, as they have over recent years. In particular, the rise in consumer price inflation through 2000 to 2002 was partly driven by higher traded-goods prices following the 25 per cent depreciation in the nominal trade-weighted exchange rate between early 1998 and late 2001. More recently, the lower inflation outcomes largely reflect the 33 per cent appreciation of the Australian dollar since late 2001. This appreciation contributed to a 0.5 per cent fall in prices of tradables (excluding volatile items) in the September quarter; over the year, prices of tradables were broadly unchanged (Graph 70). ", " In contrast, the prices of non-tradables have increased strongly over the past year, rising by 4.1 per cent. This rise reflects considerable upward pressure on housing-related prices and the prices of a number of non-market goods and services. ", " Over the year to the September quarter, the housing component of the CPI increased by 4.6 per cent. This was underpinned by a 6.1 per cent rise in house-purchase costs, although many of the ongoing costs related to housing also grew strongly. The price of utilities and property rates and charges, for example, both increased by more than 5 per cent over the year. Running against this trend of large increases in housing-related prices, the increase in average rents has been quite modest, reflecting higher vacancy rates in many markets. ", " Strong price pressures are also evident in health and education services, with the price of health services rising by around 8 per cent over the past year and the price of education services by just under 5 per cent. While, in trend terms, the prices of these services tend to increase more quickly than the overall CPI, the recent outcomes partly reflect the relatively high wage increases in these sectors over the past year. ", " Looking in more detail at the September quarter, the removal of the Ansett Levy, as well as falling prices for international travel contributed to a 1.8 per cent fall in the price of holiday travel and accommodation. Food prices also fell (by 0.3 per cent) as the impact of the drought began to subside. The trend decline in audio, visual and computing equipment continued in the September quarter, with prices falling a further 7.3 per cent to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">20.8 per cent</span> lower over the year. While the magnitude of this fall partly reflects the appreciation of the currency, it also reflects ongoing price declines associated with global overproduction and high productivity growth continuing in this sector. ", " Working in the other direction, there were sizeable rises in motoring charges and urban transport fares in the September quarter, as well as in alcohol and tobacco prices, due in part to the bi-annual excise indexation. Fuel prices were also up 3 per cent in the quarter, after having fallen by 9.6 per cent in the June quarter. ", " As with consumer prices, the exchange rate has been an important influence on producer prices recently. Over the past year, the prices of imported producer goods at all stages of production have fallen sharply, with prices continuing to fall in the September quarter. At the same time, however, significant upward pressures are evident in producer prices for domestically produced goods. This is most apparent at the final stage of production, where prices increased by 1.3 per cent in the September quarter to be up 4.3 per cent over the year, due in large part to higher prices for housing-related items and higher utilities charges. Reflecting these two contrasting sets of influences, overall final goods prices rose by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter, and by 1.5 per cent over the year (Table 15, Graph 71). Indicators of upstream inflationary pressures from business surveys remain generally subdued, reflecting the dampening effect of the exchange rate appreciation. ", " Most measures of wages show that growth continued at a firm pace over the first half of 2003. This is consistent with other indicators pointing to relatively tight conditions in the labour market (as discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic Conditions</a>’). In addition to the relatively low unemployment rate, business surveys suggest that firms are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable labour. ", " In the June quarter, the wage cost index (WCI) for total pay increased by 0.8 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, to be 3.5 per cent higher over the year, compared with an increase of 3.6 per cent over the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">March 2003 (Graph 72)</span>. Data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) suggest that average wage growth certified in new federal enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) was around 4 per cent over the first half of 2003, similar to the growth rate over the second half of 2002. Unit labour costs (based on compensation per hour worked) grew by 1.3 per cent in the June quarter to be 2.8 per cent higher over the year, which is around the average growth rate of the past few years. The WCI suggests that the education sector experienced the largest wage increases over the year to the June quarter 2003, while the smallest gains were in the communications sector. Despite signs of emerging labour shortages, the WCI records that wage increases in the construction industry over the past year were only marginally above the all-industry average. Nonetheless, builders are reporting significant cost pressures in the construction sector, driven by increased payments to subcontractors (which are not covered by the WCI). ", " Preliminary indications are that wages growth remained firm in the September quarter. The NAB survey suggested that growth over the year to the September quarter was similar to that seen over the year to June, while the latest Mercer <em>Quarterly Salary Review</em> suggests that growth in executives' base salaries picked up marginally to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.5 per cent</span> over the year to the September quarter. ", " Measures of inflation expectations have been relatively stable for some time (Graph 73). The Melbourne Institute survey suggests that consumers' inflation expectations remain around their average for the inflation-targeting period. In line with this, the NAB survey reported that firms continue to anticipate low and steady inflation for final product and retail prices, both of which are expected to increase by 0.3 per cent in the December quarter. ", " Investors' expectations of inflation over longer horizons – as measured by the difference between the yield on 10-year nominal and indexed bonds – have fluctuated in a narrow range of between 2 and 2½ per cent over recent years. The Bank's quarterly survey of financial market economists suggests that near-term inflation expectations have changed little over recent months, with the median forecast for inflation over the year to <span class=\"no-wrap\">June 2004</span> at 2.2 per cent in November, compared with 2.3 per cent in August. However, while inflation is expected to moderate from current levels in the short term, it is widely expected to pick up a little in 2005, with the median forecast for inflation in the year to June 2005 stable over recent quarters at 2.5 per cent (Table 16). Trade union officials surveyed by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT) still expect inflation to be 3.0 per cent over the year to mid 2004. Over the year to mid 2005, they expect inflation of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.2 per cent</span>, which is up slightly from their August projection. ", " As indicated above, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation in the year to the September quarter was around 2¾ per cent, the same as in the past two quarters. At the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> the Bank judged that year-ended underlying inflation was likely to fall to around 2 per cent in the first half of 2004, reflecting the appreciation of the Australian dollar, before edging up over 2005. Since that time, the key developments have been a further appreciation of the currency and stronger-than-expected growth in domestic demand. The net effect of these factors is that, compared with earlier expectations, year-ended underlying inflation may now trough somewhat lower, while the pick-up in inflation into 2005 is now likely to be more pronounced, with underlying inflation expected to be back at around 2½ per cent by the second half of the year (assuming no further change in the exchange rate). ", " Year-ended CPI inflation is expected to be marginally below underlying inflation for much of 2004. This largely reflects the large March 2003 CPI figure dropping out of the year-ended calculation, as well as the Bank's standard assumption that international oil prices will fall to the middle of the OPEC target band within about a year. As these effects abate in the first half of 2005, CPI and underlying inflation are expected to become more closely aligned. ", " As has been the case for some time, the main source of downside risk to the inflation forecast is associated with the international economic climate. If the current global recovery were to lose momentum, it would mean a less favourable environment for growth of the Australian economy, and thus lower inflation outcomes in the medium term. However, as discussed elsewhere in this <em>Statement</em>, the risk of significant under-performance of the global economy has lessened considerably over recent months. Another source of downside risk is the possibility of a further appreciation of the exchange rate. However, if that were to occur in the context of generally strengthening economic conditions in Australia and abroad, there would be offsetting upward pressures from strong demand. On the upside, there is a risk that the pass-through of recent exchange rate changes into retail prices will be less than currently anticipated, if retailers take advantage of strong domestic demand to increase profit margins. This would mean that the decline in inflation in the short term would be less than currently expected. There is also a longer-term risk that domestic cost pressures build further, given the strong momentum of domestic demand. ", " Drought conditions have eased across most agricultural regions over recent months. Winter rainfall was generally above average, and although September was unseasonably warm and dry in New South Wales and Queensland, good rainfall occurred in October. The Bureau of Meteorology's latest rainfall outlook suggests average rainfall over the remainder of the winter cropping season. ", " Farm production is therefore expected to recover strongly in 2003/04. ABS projections, based on forecasts by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), are for a 28 per cent rise in farm GDP in 2003/04. The expected recovery would contribute to aggregate growth in 2003/04 by about <span class=\"no-wrap\">¾ of a percentage point (Graph A1)</span>. This follows a 27.5 per cent fall in farm GDP in 2002/03, which subtracted <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage point</span> from aggregate growth. The expected recovery in farm incomes over 2004 is also likely to have positive flow-on effects to industries that supply and service agricultural activities. ", " The rebound in farm GDP will be concentrated in winter crop production, with other areas of agricultural production continuing to be subdued. While the first large increase in output will be recorded in the September quarter, the recovery in exports will begin in the December quarter, once the crop has been harvested and shipment occurs. ", " Largely because rainfall throughout 2003 has been quite patchy, the recovery is expected to be somewhat more subdued than has previously been seen following major droughts. Farm GDP in 2003/04 is likely to be around 7 per cent below the pre-drought level recorded in 2001/02, with winter crop production likely to be 5½ per cent lower than the pre-drought level. While conditions in Western Australia have been excellent, patchy rainfall across the eastern grain belt led to some late plantings and thus lower expected yields. Furthermore, the recovery in summer crop production in 2003/04 is expected to be more muted than is typical, since the continuing shortage of stored water will constrain production of irrigated crops such as rice and cotton, particularly in New South Wales. ", " While livestock-related production normally comprises around half of farm production, it is not expected to contribute to the recovery in farm output in 2003/04. In drought years, farmers generally increase slaughter rates rather than incur the high costs of retaining stock. The subsequent rebuilding of livestock numbers takes time, so recoveries of livestock-related production from drought are generally more protracted than those for crop production. This is particularly the case on this occasion, given the severity of the recent drought. ", " The re-stocking process will mean that meat production and live animal exports will fall significantly in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2003/04</span>. Lower sheep numbers will also result in a fall in wool production, but dairy production is expected to rise slightly. ", " Since 1997, equity prices in both Australia and the US have risen by around 40 per cent (Graph B1). Movements in equity prices, however, provide only a partial measure of returns; a comparison of total returns requires also that dividends be taken into account. From the point of view of someone investing in both markets, exchange rate movements also need to be taken into account. This box attempts to quantify these considerations. ", " Price indices measure the capital gain or loss from holding a portfolio of shares. In the period to 2000, US share prices rose much more strongly than those in Australia; at their peak they were about double their level in 1997, whereas in Australia the peak level was one and a half times the 1997 level. Over the subsequent three years, however, US share prices fell sharply and the net increase since 1997 is now about the same in both countries. ", " Aside from movements in share prices, investors also receive returns in the form of dividends. Indices of the total returns on equities, known as ‘accumulation indices’, are calculated by taking account of dividends. Since 1997, dividend yields on the ASX 200 have averaged 3.6 per cent. On the S&amp;P 500 they have averaged 1.5 per cent, with yields falling to around 1 per cent around the time of the peak in US share prices in 2000. Because of the higher dividend returns in Australia, the ASX 200 accumulation index has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 accumulation index by 15 percentage points since 1997 (Graph B2).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " Exchange rate changes between the Australian dollar and US dollar have broadly offset this gap. Assuming that investors did not hedge their exchange rate risk, the Australian dollar value of their US investments can be calculated by converting the US accumulation index into Australian dollars at the prevailing exchange rate. Doing so suggests that investing in the domestic share market was broadly similar to investing overseas over this period (Graph B3). ", " Finally, comparisons of equity markets' performance should also take account of differences in risk. Due to the lower price volatility of the Australian market during the past seven years, whether measured on <span class=\"no-wrap\">local-currency</span> or common-currency terms, the Australian market has outperformed the US market on a risk-adjusted basis.

The improvement has been led by the United States but also occurred in varying degrees in the other major economic regions. Associated with these developments the Australian economy has also strengthened during this period. These trends were evident at the time of the November <em>Statement</em> and have received further confirmation from the economic data in subsequent months. ", " The US economy has clearly gained strong momentum since around the middle of last year. Consumer spending continues to be an important driver of recovery, boosted by tax cuts, low interest rates and improving consumer confidence. At the same time, the recovery has become more broadly based over the recent period, with business investment now expanding, business confidence high and profits rebounding strongly. While conditions in the labour market have lagged behind other parts of the economy, there have been some more encouraging signs in that area recently as well. The US recovery is thus looking increasingly firmly established, and it continues to be supported by highly expansionary policy settings. ", " The east Asian economies have also experienced stronger conditions since mid 2003. The region is clearly benefiting from the recovery in the US but in addition is generating solid growth in domestic demand, with the Chinese economy taking on an increasingly important role in driving growth across the region. In Japan the modest cyclical upswing over the past year appeared to gather pace towards the end of the year. Among the major economic regions of most importance to Australia, only the euro-area economy continues to under-perform, although a mild recovery now seems to be occurring there as well. ", " The global pick-up in demand and activity has generated strong upward pressure on a range of commodity prices over recent months, notably for oil, gold, base metals and a number of rural commodities. As discussed below, this is contributing to upward pressure on the Australian dollar. Reflecting its very rapid rate of expansion and low exchange rate, the Chinese economy now appears to be entering a period of rising inflation, albeit from a low starting point. Among the major economies, however, inflation remains subdued for the present. ", " Global financial markets entered 2004 in a bullish mood, with market sentiment underpinned by signs that the world economic recovery is gathering pace. Major equity markets have risen further, and appetite for risk has increased, with spreads on corporate and emerging market bonds falling to levels not seen for several years. Despite the pick-up in global growth, markets are not anticipating changes in official interest rates by the three major central banks in the months immediately ahead; however, some wording changes in the Fed's late January announcement caused markets to believe that a tightening by the Fed may not be as far in the future as earlier thought. In Australia, the announcement in early December of the second increase in the cash rate target came as little surprise to financial markets, which had already priced in such a move. ", " Events in global foreign exchange markets have been dominated by the depreciation of the US dollar against all the major currencies that freely float against it. At the same time, Asian central banks have continued to intervene heavily in foreign exchange markets to prevent their currencies from appreciating against the US dollar. In this environment the Australian dollar has appreciated strongly against the US dollar and against currencies of the non-Japan Asian region over the past year, though it has been relatively stable against other major floating currencies. This has meant a significant appreciation of the Australian dollar in trade-weighted terms. ", " The more general forces that have influenced the exchange rate over the past year or so have been the relative strength of the Australian economy, the associated yield differential in favour of Australian dollar assets, and the continued improvement in Australia's terms of trade, which are now at their highest level in more than 25 years. On a trade-weighted basis, the exchange rate has appreciated by around 20 per cent over the past year. A significant part of that movement is a return to normal from an exceptionally low starting point. Nevertheless, the appreciation has continued to an extent that has in recent months brought the exchange rate noticeably above its long-run average. Hence the appreciation of the exchange rate is reducing the stimulus to the Australian economy from the other external forces currently at work. ", " In line with the improvement in global conditions, the Australian economy has picked up significantly since around the middle of last year. The national accounts recorded a strong pace of growth in the September quarter, and more recent information indicates that this strength has subsequently been maintained. Consumer spending expanded at a pace well above average in the second half of 2003, and consumer confidence has remained high, rising further in January to its highest level since 1994. Most business surveys have continued to report <span class=\"no-wrap\">above-average</span> conditions, with the NAB survey of non-farm businesses reporting that conditions in the December quarter were at their strongest in a decade. Demand for labour has increased, with employment rising solidly over recent months and the unemployment rate continuing to trend down. ", " Overall, the growth of the economy has been driven by well-above-average growth in domestic spending, while the main factors that were holding back growth, particularly in the period up to around mid 2003, were the drought and the unfavourable international environment. These negative factors, however, are now being reversed. With improved rainfall in most areas, farm production is adding significantly to growth. Reflecting the strengthening international environment, Australia's export earnings have begun to increase gradually after their decline in the first half of 2003. In light of these trends and the more promising global outlook, the prospects are that the Australian economy will continue to grow at a strong pace during 2004. Exports are likely to continue their gradual recovery as a result of stronger trading-partner growth, even though progress in this area will be dampened to some extent by the higher exchange rate now prevailing, and also by capacity constraints in the resources sector. Domestic demand growth is likely to moderate a little but remain quite strong. ", " Australia's recent inflation performance has been marked by contrasting influences from domestic conditions and the exchange rate. In the December quarter the CPI increased by 0.5 per cent, and by 2.4 per cent over the year, down from an annual rate of around 3 per cent a year earlier. Inflation in the non-traded sector of the economy remains relatively high, at over 4 per cent, reflecting the overall strength of the domestic economy, strong demand conditions in the housing sector and continuing cost pressures in some service industries. At the same time, the overall inflation rate is being held down by the gradual pass-through of the exchange rate appreciation, with prices of tradable items in the CPI declining slightly in recent quarters. ", " The experience of recent years has been that these exchange rate effects have tended to be smaller than initially expected, but even so, it is likely that the dampening effect from the exchange rate still has some way to run. As a result, inflation is likely to decline further over the coming year, and could fall as low as 1½ per cent, before returning to around 2½ per cent in 2005 and then continuing on a gradually rising trajectory. The monetary policy strategy needs to take this longer-term trajectory into account, since a continually rising exchange rate cannot be relied upon to hold inflation permanently below a rate consistent with its domestic determinants. ", " In its deliberations in the final months of 2003 the Board took into account the fact that policy had for some time been relatively expansionary. Interest rates were clearly below relevant averages and strong demand for credit confirmed that borrowers found these interest rates highly attractive. As economic conditions continued to strengthen, both in Australia and internationally, it became increasingly apparent that such an expansionary policy setting was no longer needed, and that it would add to medium-term inflation risks if maintained for too long a period. ", " An additional consideration in this environment was the risk to the economy posed by the build-up of household debt and the associated increases in house prices. While this was not the principal driver of policy, it did argue for avoiding undue delay when a case for moving to a less expansionary setting emerged on broader macroeconomic grounds. Given all these considerations, as explained in the November <em>Statement</em>, the Board decided at its November meeting to raise the cash rate by 25 basis points. At the time of its December meeting, the available information confirmed the assessment that a less expansionary policy setting was needed, and the cash rate was therefore raised by a further 25 basis points, to 5.25 per cent. ", " In the period since the December meeting, the Board has continued to assess how developments in all these areas have influenced the balance of risks facing the Australian economy. The macroeconomic data becoming available since the December meeting have confirmed the assessments made at that time – namely, that the Australian economy is growing strongly, and that the global pick-up underway since mid 2003 has become more firmly established. In this environment the overall prospects are still for continued strong growth of the Australian economy in the year ahead. ", " Information from credit and asset markets during this period has provided some tentative indications that the pressures in these markets may be starting to ease. This has been evident both in a decline in housing loan approvals, and in a slowing of the growth in house prices and declining auction clearances. Even so, it is too early to be confident that this represents a definitive change in trend. A further development taken into account was the additional appreciation of the Australian dollar since December, including a period when it was rising particularly quickly in early January. The higher exchange rate will hold down inflation in the short term, though this effect will eventually wear off. At its February meeting the Board weighed up all of this information and its implications for the balance of risks for the economy and the medium-term inflation outlook. Although the bulk of the evidence was still suggesting that the stance of policy remained mildly accommodative, the Board decided to hold the cash rate unchanged at its February meeting while continuing to monitor how these various factors evolve over the period ahead. ", " Global economic conditions have continued to improve over recent months, with the run of news being generally positive. After successive upward revisions, the Consensus forecast is now for growth in the world economy to be above trend in 2004, with growth more synchronised across countries than has been the case for some time <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 1)</span>. The pick-up in growth is particularly evident in the United States, where the expansionary macroeconomic policy settings of recent times are clearly having an effect. Conditions in east Asia have also improved, with China continuing to grow strongly and a resurgence in global ITC demand. The euro area continues to lag behind, but there too a modest pick-up in growth appears to be underway. Overall, Australia's trading partners are expected to grow by 4.1 per cent in 2004, around ½ a percentage point faster than the average of the past decade (Graph 1). ", " In the US, the pace of recovery from the 2001 recession picked up markedly in the second half of 2003. After recording growth of 1.3 per cent over the first half of the year, GDP rose by 3.0 per cent over the second <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of the year (Graph 2)</span>. This acceleration is partly due to the very expansionary monetary and fiscal policy settings that have been in place for some time, with the federal funds rate at 1 per cent, and the federal fiscal balance swinging from a surplus of 2½ per cent of GDP in 2000 to a 3½ per cent deficit in 2003. The depreciation of the US dollar and increases in household wealth, arising from renewed strength in the stock market, have also played a role. ", " The main area of uncertainty is still the labour market, with the picture being clouded by conflicting data. On the one hand, the recovery in non-farm payrolls over recent months has been only modest and slower than has been the case in previous recoveries. On the other hand, new claims for unemployment benefits have declined and the household survey measure of employment has recorded reasonable gains (Graph 3). As a result, the unemployment rate, which is derived from the household survey, has fallen by about ½ a percentage point from its recent peak, although this decline is also partly explained by a large fall in the participation rate. More <span class=\"no-wrap\">forward-looking</span> indicators, including surveys of hiring intentions, suggest that labour demand is likely to strengthen in the period ahead. Also, businesses are likely to find it increasingly difficult to continue to expand output at current rates without a pick-up in hiring. ", " Despite the weakness in the labour market, household spending has made a large contribution to economic growth over the past six months, with consumption increasing at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent over this period <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 2)</span>. While tax cuts in the September quarter provided a significant boost, spending has also benefited from low mortgage interest rates and rising household wealth. The payment of tax refunds in the first half of 2004 should provide further impetus. Low interest rates have also helped residential building activity, which expanded at a rapid rate in the second half of 2003, to be 10 per cent higher than a year earlier. Forward-looking indicators suggest further growth in residential building activity in the near term, but an easing thereafter. ", " The improvement in the economy has led to a marked pick-up in business confidence and profits, as well as a recovery in business investment (Graph 4). Business sentiment in the manufacturing industry is at around 20-year highs, and has been accompanied by an expansion in production since mid 2003 at around the same rate as occurred during the late 1990s. With a sharp rise in order backlogs and low levels of stocks, a further expansion is likely. Conditions have also improved in the services sector, with the ISM measure of sentiment at very high levels. Consistent with the strength of overall business confidence, business investment expanded by 1.7 per cent in the December quarter, to be 6.4 per cent higher than a year earlier. ", " Large gains in labour productivity, in combination with a slight decline in the growth rate of labour compensation and relatively mild upstream price pressures, mean that overall inflationary pressures remain subdued. Consumer price inflation has eased in recent months, to 1.9 per cent over the year to December (Graph 5), and core consumer prices rose by just 1.1 per cent – the slowest pace in nearly 40 years. The core chain price (PCE) measure of inflation, favoured by the Federal Reserve, is even lower at around 0.7 per cent. Accordingly, the Fed has indicated that it ‘can be patient in removing its policy accommodation’. ", " The Japanese economy has grown in each of the past six quarters, although at a relatively moderate pace so that spare capacity remains considerable. Real GDP is 1.8 per cent higher over the year to the September quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 6)</span>, and more timely indicators point to further growth in the December quarter. ", " Exports, particularly to east Asia, have been a key factor behind the growth over the past year and a half, with China being an important source of demand (Graph 7). The recovery in world ITC demand has also contributed to the strength in exports, as it has for exports from a number of countries in east Asia (Graph 8). With external demand picking up, business sentiment and profitability have also risen in Japan, and manufacturing production increased strongly over the latter part of 2003. Growth in business investment has also picked up over the year to September, and with machinery orders trending higher in late 2003, further increases in investment are likely. Better conditions are also evident in the services sector; the Tertiary Activity Index has trended higher in recent months, despite a decline in November, and is 1.4 per cent higher over the year. The brighter outlook is confirmed by a more positive tone to the Tankan and the Shoko Chukin business surveys. ", " In contrast to the improving conditions in the business sector, household spending has been flat over the past year, held back by a relatively subdued labour market. Employment has been broadly unchanged over this period, although with the participation rate having fallen, the unemployment rate has declined to around 5 per cent from its record high of 5½ per cent early in 2003. More recent indicators have been a little more positive, with job offers picking up, the rate of decline of wages slowing, and consumer sentiment rising. ", " In line with the improvement in economic conditions there has been some easing in deflationary pressures. Excluding the volatile fresh food component, consumer prices have been flat over the past year, compared with deflation rates of almost 1 per cent in recent years, although part of this improvement is attributable to increases in administered medical prices and tobacco taxes earlier in 2003. More recently, a rise in the price of rice (due to a poor harvest) has also played a role. The GDP deflator has fallen by a more sizeable 2.2 per cent over the year to the September quarter, in part reflecting difficulties in estimating the investment price deflator. This in turn implies that the estimates of real GDP growth may be overstated. Notwithstanding this measurement problem, the current conjuncture in Japan is brighter than it has been for some time. ", " After a difficult period in the first half of 2003, east Asian economies are growing strongly again (Table 3). The largest rebounds have been in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, all of which recorded strong growth following the SARS outbreak earlier in the year. China and India have also been growing strongly, while the Korean economy appears to be picking up. A number of countries in the region whose currencies have been tied to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar (including China, Hong Kong and Malaysia)</span> have benefited from its decline, with real depreciations aiding export growth. ", " The Chinese economy continued to grow at a rapid pace over 2003, providing considerable impetus to the rest of the region, and boosting global commodity demand. China's economy grew by almost 10 per cent over the year to the December quarter, while industrial production increased by 18 per cent and investment by 23 per cent. Values of imports and exports soared, rising by around 50 per cent over the year to December as firms rushed to fill export orders ahead of the cut in export rebates on 1 January 2004 (Graph 9). While some easing may be expected in 2004, growth should still continue at a rapid rate, helped in part by a very competitive exchange rate. ", " Recent indicators for the rest of the region also point to continued strength in the December quarter. Industrial production and merchandise exports recorded further gains (Graph 10), following a robust September quarter result, and tourist arrivals have fully recovered from the effect of the SARS outbreak. The Korean economy seems to be recovering, with the jump up in global ITC demand sparking a resurgent export performance. Also, consumption has been a little stronger recently after being curtailed by policy measures to rein in expanding household debt, although ongoing balance sheet adjustment is likely to be a dampening influence for some time. In contrast, growth in India has remained well above trend, helped by a good monsoon season, but with stronger performance also apparent in the service and industrial sectors. Across the region, labour markets appear to have responded to improved growth and the unemployment rate has edged down in most countries. ", " Despite renewed strength in activity, consumer price inflation remains generally subdued in most countries across the region. An exception is China, where the inflation rate has climbed to 3.2 per cent – the fastest increase in prices since early 1997 – although this partly reflects one-off factors that saw food prices soar. While inflation of consumer prices has been low across east Asia, a number of countries have been experiencing pockets of significant asset-price inflation, associated with a pick-up in credit and money growth. ", " The New Zealand economy continues to grow strongly, underpinned by strong domestic demand, while net exports are still acting as a drag on growth. The overall strength of the economy has contributed to tight labour market conditions, with the unemployment rate down to 4.4 per cent, a level last seen 15 years ago. This performance has contributed to pressure on non-tradable consumer prices, which were up 4.6 per cent over the year to December. Overall CPI inflation was a more modest 1.6 per cent over the year, held down by weakness in the prices of internationally tradable goods flowing from the appreciation of the currency. Citing emerging domestic price pressures and stronger-than-expected household spending and housing market activity, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its policy rate by ¼ of a percentage point in January to 5¼ per cent. ", " A modest recovery in the euro area seems to have begun in the second half of 2003. After declining slightly over the previous three quarters, euro-area GDP rose by 0.4 per cent in the September quarter, to be 0.3 per cent higher over the year (Table 4). The pick-up was driven primarily by increased external demand while domestic demand remained weak, weighed down by flat household consumption and falling investment spending. Looking forward, euro-area exports will be helped by stronger economic growth elsewhere in the world, although the renewed appreciation of the euro in recent months will exert a dampening influence, and a sustainable recovery in the euro area will require a return to growth in domestic demand. ", " Along with better outcomes in the September quarter, indicators of confidence have picked up through <span class=\"no-wrap\">the year (Graph 11)</span>. Measures of business confidence have risen steadily since mid 2003 to be back around more normal levels, and concurrently there has been a slight rise in the trend for industrial production. While consumer confidence has also been rising over this period, it remains considerably below average in most countries and there has yet to be an improvement in retail sales overall. ", " Headline inflation continues to hold at the ECB's 2 per cent reference value, despite the weakness in economic activity and the appreciation of the euro (Graph 12). This partly reflects the impact of higher food prices and rising indirect taxes, with underlying inflation a little under 1¾ per cent. Also, to date, there has been only a modest slowing in labour costs from around 3½ per cent in 2002 to 2.9 per cent over the year to the September quarter. The ECB has left its policy rate unchanged since June 2003 at 2 per cent. ", " Despite rising real wages, and the weakness in activity, the unemployment rate remains steady at 8.8 per cent, well below its earlier peak of 11 per cent. Employment in the euro area as a whole has been flat over the past year, although outcomes have varied considerably across countries, with Germany displaying notable weakness. ", " In contrast to the rest of Europe, the pace of growth of the United Kingdom economy has risen considerably through 2003; GDP grew by 0.9 per cent in the December quarter to be 2.5 per cent higher over the year. Household consumption continues to be a key contributor to overall growth, propelled by a relatively tight labour market and rising house prices, which are up by around 15 per cent over the past year. The Bank of England increased its policy rate by ¼ of a percentage point in November to 3¾ per cent, noting the better global outlook and the unexpected strength of consumer spending and the housing market. The Bank of England has switched to targeting the harmonised Consumer Prices Index (CPI), and the inflation target was reduced from <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ to 2 per cent</span> to account for the difference between the old (retail price index) and new measures. Based on the CPI, inflation is currently 1.3 per cent (Graph 12), although the Bank of England expects upward pressure on inflation to build gradually over the medium term. ", " Optimism in global financial markets has increased further over the past three months, as the US-led global economic recovery continues to gather pace. For a time, markets were also buoyed by the receding prospect of monetary tightening in G3 economies, although comments by the Fed in late January caused them to bring forward again their expectations of the first Fed tightening to around the middle of the year. Equity markets have rallied further, while credit spreads on bonds have narrowed. The US dollar has continued to depreciate against most of the major currencies that freely float against it. It has fallen only marginally against the Asian currencies, however, as a number of Asian central banks have continued to intervene heavily in foreign exchange markets to prevent their currencies from appreciating against the US dollar. ", " The Australian dollar has been part of the group of major floating currencies that has risen against the US dollar. It has been a little stronger than the other currencies in the group, as international investors have been attracted to the currency by the prospect of strongly rising commodity prices and the positive interest rate differential. The Reserve Bank has taken advantage of the higher exchange rate to continue to rebuild holdings of international reserves following the interventions that took place between 1997 and 2001. ", " In the US, the Federal Reserve kept the fed funds rate at a 45 year low of 1.0 per cent over the second <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of 2003</span>, despite robust economic growth (Graph 13). Market expectations of monetary tightening by the Fed receded through most of December and January, particularly after the publication of weaker-than-expected employment data for December. These expectations were brought forward again when the Fed dropped the reference to rates being on hold for a ‘considerable period’ in its late January monetary policy announcement, though financial markets are not pricing in a tightening until the middle of 2004. ", " Markets also expect the monetary authorities in the euro area and Japan to keep policy rates at their current low levels for some time. In the euro area the economic recovery continues to lag other regions, while some European Central Bank (ECB) officials have begun to express concern about the impact of the appreciating euro. In Japan the Bank of Japan continues to assert that it will not tighten policy until CPI inflation becomes consistently positive. ", " Among other central banks: ", " Asian central banks have generally held official interest rates steady over the past three months, at low levels. Together with the policy of allowing their exchange rates to fall with the US dollar, this has created very accommodative monetary conditions. In Latin America, Brazil reduced its policy rate by a further <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.5 percentage</span> points to 16.5 per cent over November and December, taking the cumulative reduction since June 2003 to 10 percentage points. Chile's central bank lowered rates by 100 basis points to 1.75 per cent. Exchange rates in Latin America, like those in Asia, have not changed much against the US dollar in recent months, so monetary conditions there have also eased noticeably. ", " In the US, yields on 10-year Government bonds fell through most of December and January, to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent;</span> they had mostly been in the range of 4¼–4½ per cent through the second half of 2003. However, following the Fed's late January monetary policy announcement they rose to around 4.2 per cent (Graph 14). Throughout this period, continued demand for US securities from Asian central banks associated with foreign exchange intervention has served to keep downward pressure on yields. The slope of the yield curve in the US is steep by historical standards, with the spread between the Fed funds rate and 10-year bond yields at over <span class=\"no-wrap\">300 basis points</span>, around the highest it has been since the early 1990s (Graph 15). ", " European yields have generally taken their lead from developments in the US over recent months, with yields on German 10-year government debt also falling toward 4 per cent in mid January, before increasing to 4.2 per cent after the Fed's late January monetary policy announcement. Yields on 10-year Japanese government debt have been relatively stable, averaging around 1.3 per cent. ", " As optimism about the health of the global economy has increased, risk aversion (as observed in bond markets) has continued to decline. Both corporate and emerging market sovereign debt spreads are now quite tight compared to their historical averages. Spreads on US corporate debt have generally fallen to levels last seen before the 2001 US recession (Graph 16), while spreads on emerging market sovereign debt have returned to levels last prevailing in the months prior to the Asian crisis in 1997 (Graph 17). The reduction reflects improvements in economic prospects in emerging markets, and increased investor interest in higher-yielding debt, given the relatively low yields available in industrial countries. ", " The improvement in sovereign spreads in Latin America reflects an improvement in the outlook for Brazil. Standard and Poor's recently raised the ratings outlook on the country's debt following an earlier upgrade by Fitch. Spreads on European emerging market debt have also narrowed as investor concerns about political developments in Russia have subsided and the country's credit rating has been upgraded. Spreads in Asia, which were already at significantly lower levels than in other regions, have been relatively steady in recent months. ", " Over the past year the major global share indices have staged a significant recovery (Graph 18 and Table 5), after falling for the previous three years. In the US the S&amp;P 500 is up 7 per cent over the past three months and has gained 41 per cent from its March 2003 low. While this is a significant rebound, it is well within the historical norm following bear markets that lasted two years or longer. ", " Equity market gains have been supported by the low interest rate environment and the strong rebound in corporate profitability in the context of the recovery in US economic activity (see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A: US Corporate Profits</a>’). Analysts are expecting further strong growth in corporate earnings over the coming year. ", " The increases in profits and in equity prices over recent quarters have been similar, so the price-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 has been fairly steady, at a little under 30 (Graph 19). ", " The rebound in European and Japanese equities has been similar to that seen in the US. The Euro STOXX index is up 9 per cent over the past 3 months and around 50 per cent since its March 2003 low. It is somewhat surprising that European share markets have risen as much as those in the US, given the recovery in European economic activity has not been as strong as that in the US. It continues a pattern seen since the mid 1990s where European share prices seem to mirror what is happening in US markets rather than developments in the local economy. The Japanese Topix is up 35 per cent from its 2003 low, and around 1 per cent over the past three months. ", " Stock markets in the emerging economies have also performed strongly over the past three months. <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian equity</span> markets increased an average 7 per cent, while those in Latin America rose by 22 per cent. Average equity prices in Asia are now 52 per cent above their 2003 lows, while Latin American equity prices have shown the largest rises, up an average 120 per cent from recent lows. The out-performance reflects the benefits flowing to the Latin American region not only from low US interest rates (these countries have large US dollar borrowings) but also its exposure to stronger growth outcomes in the US, with strong rises in the prices of key commodity exports boosting the price of local mining companies. ", " The decline in the US dollar evident since early 2002 continued over the past three months (Graph 20). <span class=\"no-wrap\">Since end October</span>, the major currency trade-weighted measure of the US dollar has fallen by 4 per cent, while the broad-based measure of the TWI has fallen by 3 per cent. From its early 2002 peak, the US dollar has fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">24 per cent</span> on the major currency TWI but only 13 per cent on the broader measure, which includes several currencies that are either directly linked to the US dollar or closely managed against it. ", " The fall of the US dollar has been particularly marked against the euro and some other European currencies. By mid January, the euro had risen to its highest level against the US dollar since its creation in 1999. However, the continued appreciation prompted comments from several ECB officials, which seemed to slow the rise. The change to the Fed's policy statement in late January caused the US dollar to strengthen, and the euro is currently around 2 per cent below its early January peak (Graph 21). ", " The Japanese authorities have continued to heavily intervene in the foreign exchange market, capping the yen's rise against the US dollar over the past three months to 4 per cent, around half the rise experienced by the euro against the US dollar (Graph 21). The unprecedented scale of foreign exchange intervention saw Japan's foreign reserves increase by US$204 billion over 2003, to a record high of US$674 billion. The rate of intervention increased further in January. ", " Other Asian central banks have also continued to intervene heavily in foreign exchange markets, restricting the average Asian currency appreciation against the US dollar to less than 1 per cent since the last <em>Statement</em>. Official reserves of Asian countries (excluding Japan) rose by a further US$40 billion during November and December, to a total of US$1,200 billion. Asian countries (including Japan) now account for around two-thirds of the world's holdings of international reserves. South Korea took additional measures to restrict movements in its currency, implementing controls on non-deliverable forward contracts in mid January in an effort to curb speculation in the won. ", " Latin American currencies have on average been steady against the US dollar over the past three months. ", " The big fall in the US dollar over the past year has been reflected in the bilateral AUD/USD exchange rate, which ended January at around US77 cents, a rise of 30 per cent over the past 12 months (Graph 22). This is a bigger increase than has occurred in any 12-month period since the Australian dollar was floated in 1983. ", " On a trade-weighted basis, the rise in the Australian dollar has also been quite substantial, since the TWI gives a high weight to a number of Asian currencies whose governments have chosen to depreciate with the US dollar. While the US dollar itself accounts for 14 per cent of the TWI, the total weight of the US dollar and those currencies which are either directly linked to it or closely managed against it is around 50 per cent. Hence, as a result first of large depreciations of a number of Asian currencies during the Asian crisis of 1997 and 1998, and then their more recent decline with the US dollar, the Australian dollar is now some 60 per cent higher than its post-float average against a group of Asian currencies (Graph 23). Against a number of other major currencies apart from the US dollar, such as the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc and Japanese yen, on the other hand, the Australian dollar is currently below its post-float average. ", " One factor supporting the Australian dollar over the past couple of years has been that interest rates right across the yield curve in Australia, and perceived returns on other assets, have been higher than those in a number of other countries, particularly those which experienced a recession and a collapse of share prices in the early part of this decade. Exceptionally easy monetary policy in many of these countries meant that Australian interest rates which were, by Australian standards, quite low, were still relatively high compared with those abroad. ", " Even so, interest rate differentials do not explain much of the rise in the Australian dollar against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> and the currencies of Asia over the past year. In that period, both the euro and, to a lesser extent, the yen have appreciated against the US dollar, even though European interest rates are only slightly higher than American rates, and Japanese rates are lower. While the Australian dollar has appreciated more than some of these other currencies, the additional appreciation is not that large (see Graph 24), and, as noted above, the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar</span> remains below average levels against currencies such as the euro and yen. ", " Over the most recent six months, it is likely that an increasingly important factor which has changed in favour of the Australian dollar has been a growing perception that the global economy is finally entering a period of stronger growth. Historically, it has been normal for such periods to be associated with firming commodity prices and, as a result, a tendency for international capital markets to find Australian-dollar assets attractive. This relationship broke down in the early part of this decade, when strong global growth coincided with an unexpected weakening in the Australian dollar, but seems to have reasserted itself lately. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the Australian dollar has come under some upward pressure relative to most currencies, including the US dollar. What makes the current situation unusual is the degree of weakness of many currencies in Asia. ", " An additional factor which has, at the margin, increased the demand for Australian-dollar assets is demand from other central banks to hold Australian dollars as part of their international reserves. Central banks in Asia have a long history of holding some Australian dollars. Recently, there has probably been a pick-up in their demand, but there has also been new demand from some central banks in other parts of the world. ", " As the exchange rate has continued to rise, the Bank has continued its program of rebuilding reserves which were run down during the period between 1997–2001. At the more recent higher levels of the exchange rate, these purchases have been made at a somewhat faster rate than had been the case earlier. ", " The Australian economy has grown strongly since mid 2003, with forward-looking indicators pointing to continuing strength in the coming year. GDP increased by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter, and while GDP figures are not yet available for the December quarter, other data for this period are consistent with above-trend growth, and an economy entering 2004 with considerable momentum. This strong growth comes after a period of <span class=\"no-wrap\">below-average</span> outcomes, when the economy was weighed down by the effects of the drought and the weak global environment. Over the year to the September quarter, GDP expanded by 2.6 per cent (Table 6). ", " The past couple of years have been characterised by very strong growth in domestic demand, and this continued into the September quarter, with private final demand increasing by almost 2 per cent (Graph 25). The strength has been broadly based, with consumption, dwelling investment and business investment all growing at above-trend rates and recording significant increases in the September quarter. ", " In contrast to strong domestic demand, net exports have acted as a substantial drag on GDP growth over the past couple of years, although this drag has begun to diminish. According to the national accounts, exports picked up in the September quarter, while the farm sector has begun to recover from the drought in 2002/03, with farm output rising by 17 per cent in the quarter. Further increases in exports are expected in the period ahead, in line with the continuing recovery in the rural sector and the improving international economic climate. Imports are also likely to grow strongly, consistent with the robust outlook for the domestic economy and recent appreciation of the exchange rate. ", " A high rate of growth in spending by households has been an important factor sustaining the strong performance of the Australian economy. This spending has been underpinned by supportive financial conditions, with household wealth increasing at a brisk pace, driven by rapid increases in dwelling prices, and more recently, rising equity prices <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 7)</span>. Firm growth in wages, a strong labour market, and a rebound in farm incomes have also played important roles. ", " The strong growth in spending is evident in the latest national accounts, which showed an increase in consumption of 1.7 per cent in the September quarter, to be 4.4 per cent higher over the year. Growth in the quarter was broadly based across both goods and services. This strength was maintained into the December quarter, notwithstanding a modest decline in the value of retail sales in the month of December. The volume of retail trade increased by 2.6 per cent in the quarter, following similar growth in the September quarter (Graph 26). This outcome means that the increase in the volume of retail trade over the second half of 2003 was the fastest in any six-month period in at least the past 20 years. Sales of motor vehicles reached record levels in 2003, reflecting high levels of vehicle affordability, though sales have fallen in recent months. ", " Consistent with strong consumer spending, the Westpac-Melbourne Institute measure of consumer sentiment rose to its highest level in nine years in January. Sentiment about personal finances in the year ahead was its most positive in the 30-year history of the survey. ", " Household credit continues to grow rapidly, rising at an annualised rate of almost 23 per cent over the six months to December. As a result, the debt-servicing burden of households has continued its upward trend. Revised data now suggest that the debt-servicing ratio reached 8.7 per cent of household disposable income in the September quarter, and it is likely to have surpassed its late-1980s peak in the December quarter (Graph 27; see ‘<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>’ for further discussion of the debt-servicing ratio). However, unlike in the late 1980s, the current increase in the ratio has been mainly driven by the decisions of households to increase their levels of debt, rather than by a significant and unexpected increase in interest rates. Consistent with this, indicators of financial stress for the household sector, such as loan arrears and personal bankruptcy rates, remain at relatively low levels. ", " The bulk of this increased borrowing has been for the purchase of housing, although it has also been used to support consumption and, to some extent, the purchase of financial assets. Over the second half of last year, personal credit recorded a solid pace of growth, and revolving credit secured against residential mortgages increased at an annual rate of around 27 per cent. Moreover, in the September quarter, the expansion in <span class=\"no-wrap\">housing-secured</span> credit exceeded household dwelling investment by around 8 per cent of disposable income. This is well above the average difference in recent years, and suggests continued withdrawal of equity from the housing stock (Graph 28). ", " Following declines in the first half of 2003, dwelling investment rose by 2.6 per cent in the September quarter and by 5.3 per cent over the year. This is a considerably stronger outcome than expected in the early part of 2003. The strength appears to have been sustained into the final quarter of the year, and leading indicators suggest that residential building activity will remain at historically high levels as a share of GDP in early 2004. Further ahead, the fundamentals that have supported strong dwelling investment in recent years – expanding employment and relatively strong underlying demand for dwellings – are expected to remain broadly favourable for residential construction. In particular, renovation activity has been strong and is likely to remain so, with many households electing to renovate rather than move, given high house prices and transaction costs. ", " Building approvals data point to solid contributions to growth from new dwelling investment in the December and <span class=\"no-wrap\">March quarters</span>. Private residential building approvals rose strongly in the September quarter, especially in the medium-density sector. Although the latest readings are suggestive of some easing, largely driven by a sharp correction in medium-density approvals, total private-sector approvals remained at a high level in the December quarter as a whole and exceed the average of the past two years (Graph 29). Activity in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">medium-density</span> sector, which is expected to remain strong in the near term, is likely to tail off later in the year as the large number of apartments currently under construction are completed. More broadly, there has also been some softening in indicators reported by housing industry bodies, including contracts to build houses and display home traffic. ", " Lending for housing remains strong, though there are some tentative signs of a slowing recently. Over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months</span> to December, housing credit increased at an annualised rate of 25 per cent, compared with a rate of 22 per cent over the six months to June. Credit extended to investors has been growing particularly strongly, at an annualised rate of 33 per cent over the six months to December. ", " While the value of loan approvals remains very high, having increased by 32 per cent over the past year, approvals declined in November for the first time since 2002, with falls being recorded for both owner-occupiers and investors (Graph 30). Despite the recent decline, further significant falls in loan approvals will be required to return the rate of housing credit growth to a level that is sustainable in the medium term (see ‘<a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>’ for further details). ", " The broad national measures of house prices continue to show very strong growth. In the September quarter, both the REIA and ABS measures recorded increases in the range of 3–3½ per cent, with both series showing rises over the year of between 15 and 18 per cent (Table 8). These outcomes suggest a mild slowing in the pace of overall growth from that recorded earlier last year. The more timely, but more volatile, measure of prices provided by the CBA continues to record strong growth, with prices at the national level up by 4.4 per cent in the December quarter and by 25 per cent over the year, though the pace has come down a little from its peak in the September quarter (see ‘<a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>’ for a discussion of alternative measures of house prices). ", " The moderation in the rate of growth in the national measures is accounted for by developments in Sydney and Melbourne. According to the REIA data, house prices in Sydney rose by 1.1 per cent in each of the June and September quarters, while the quarterly growth rate in Melbourne averaged 3 per cent over the same period, which is clearly below the peak of recent years. ", " More timely information on the housing market can be gained by looking at the results of auctions. These account for a significant proportion of sales in the two largest cities (up to a half in Melbourne and a quarter in Sydney). One useful indicator is the auction clearance rate – that is, the number of properties sold as a proportion of properties offered (including those withdrawn prior to sale). An easing in demand in the housing market tends to be associated with declining clearance rates, as a result of vendors' price expectations being unmet. This occurred in the Sydney and Melbourne markets in the final months of 2003. While there is a seasonal pattern in auction clearances, such that they tend to decline over the second half of the year, the fall in clearance rates in November and <span class=\"no-wrap\">December 2003</span> was noticeably greater than in the previous two years (Graph 31). ", " An easing in demand is also evident in auction prices during this period. The median prices of houses sold at auction in Sydney and Melbourne, while volatile from month to month and subject to seasonal influences, appear to have levelled out over 2003, with auction prices in December below their recent peaks (Graph 32). It is too early to tell, however, whether these auction outcomes are representative of the broader market and, given the seasonal pause in the real estate market over summer, whether they have continued into 2004. ", " In both cities, there is evidence of weakness in inner-city apartment prices. In Melbourne, auction prices for inner-city apartments (defined to include properties in the CBD and adjoining suburbs) have been broadly flat or declining since 2000 (Graph 33). Data on specific areas, while volatile, show that apartment prices in some localities have fallen well below their peaks. The inner-city market in aggregate has held up longer in Sydney than in Melbourne, although the latest auction price data recorded a fall. As in Melbourne, price declines have been seen in a number of areas in inner Sydney, though at this stage they have not been as pronounced. ", " While the broad city-wide house price indices have continued to rise in Sydney and Melbourne, their rate of increase has clearly declined. In contrast, prices in other capitals have continued to rise rapidly. According to both the REIA and ABS data, prices in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart and Perth have increased by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> or more over the year. With the exception of Adelaide, the CBA data show this pattern continuing into the December quarter. Residex house price data for the December quarter, based on repeat sales of individual properties, similarly show an easing in the rate of increase of aggregate prices in Sydney and Melbourne, while the pace remains rapid in Brisbane (Graph 34). ", " The contrast between developments in the Sydney and Melbourne property markets and developments elsewhere is also evident in data on rental markets. Rents continue to rise at a subdued rate in Sydney and Melbourne, and have fallen in some areas. Vacancy rates in both cities have declined a little recently, but remain at high levels and could move higher as a large number of new apartments comes on stream. In contrast, rental growth remains robust in Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra, where vacancy rates are relatively low. Despite this, rental yields even in these cities have declined to levels that are low by international standards and past experience. ", " It remains to be seen to what extent the weakening in the inner-city property markets in Sydney and Melbourne will spread more widely across the national market. However, it is clear that sentiment about the property market has softened. According to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment, the number of people who view it as a good time to buy a dwelling has fallen to its lowest level since 1989 and the number reporting that property is their preferred destination for savings has fallen to its lowest level in three years <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 35)</span>. ", " Business conditions are currently very favourable, with most industries experiencing solid growth in demand and strong profits. Business borrowing is expanding quite rapidly and measures of confidence are at a high level. The strength in demand has seen capacity utilisation increase to around the highest levels of the past decade, although a lack of capacity does not yet seem to be a significant constraint on expanding output for most industries. ", " Over the past year, output growth has been strongest in those industries exposed to domestic demand, such as construction and retail trade. More recently, business services and tourism-related industries have also seen stronger output growth. In contrast, growth has been weaker in export-oriented industries such as mining and parts of manufacturing, as well as in the farm sector and other industries that have been affected by the drought. These contrasts, however, are likely to diminish over the year ahead as the world economy recovers and the effects of the drought dissipate. ", " The recovery in farm output is now clearly underway, with a strong increase recorded in the September quarter and the ABS projecting growth of more than 40 per cent over the year to the June quarter 2004 (Graph 36). Consistent with this, the latest Rabobank survey suggests that expected business conditions in the farm sector are close to their pre-drought levels, despite concerns about the exchange rate appreciation. The recovery is likely to be driven almost entirely by cropping industries. The prospects for irrigated crop production and livestock industries are more subdued, with stored water levels still low in some states. ", " Conditions in the mining industry also look to be improving as the global recovery has gathered pace and commodity prices have risen strongly (see chapter on ‘<a href=\"#balance-of-payments\">Balance of Payments</a>’ for more detail). One offset to this brighter outlook, though, is the appreciation of the exchange rate, which reduces the Australian dollar proceeds of foreign-currency export receipts. The appreciation is also having an impact on firms in the manufacturing sector. A recent AIG survey identified the movement of the currency as a significant factor inhibiting export earnings and intensifying competitive pressures from imports, with many firms reporting lower profits as a result. ", " Overall, business surveys are consistent with strong growth in demand. The NAB survey of the non-farm sector reported that business conditions in the December quarter improved, to be at their most favourable level since the peak reached in 1994 (Graph 37). In contrast to earlier in the year, the improvement in conditions has encompassed sectors linked to the international economy and agribusiness, while business conditions in residential construction and related services have eased a little from recent peaks. A range of other business surveys are also showing current business conditions to be well above long-run average levels. ", " Business confidence also appears to be quite strong, although some firms have recently become more cautious about the outlook. The NAB survey suggests that business confidence remains above average, although it declined in the December quarter. The December quarter AIG survey of manufacturing, the ACCI survey and the Sensis survey of small businesses also reported above-average levels of confidence for the period ahead <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 38)</span>. ", " Corporate profit growth was robust over the first three quarters of 2003, with profits increasing at an annualised rate of 6½–7 per cent. Much of the strength was in sectors exposed to the domestic economy, such as retail and wholesale trade. Profitability has recovered in the manufacturing and property &amp; business services sectors, in line with improved business sentiment, and farm profitability has experienced a sharp turnaround as the effects of the drought recede, while profitability in the mining sector remains relatively low. Looking forward, responses to the NAB business survey suggest continued solid growth in non-farm profits. ", " Firms have ready access to a range of funding sources to finance investment. Resilient profit growth has provided a strong base of internal funds. Moreover, in line with recovering investor sentiment, equity raisings by non-financial companies have risen strongly in recent months, following an extended period of weakness. Borrowing from financial intermediaries has also picked up strongly over recent months, growing at an annual rate of 13 per cent over the second half of 2003. Despite this, corporate gearing ratios remain low by historical standards. ", " The current strength in business investment appears likely to continue, supported by high levels of capacity utilisation and the healthy financial position of businesses. Business investment grew by 2 per cent in the September quarter and by 11 per cent over the year, though the pace of growth eased back from its late 2002 peak of just over 20 per cent (Graph 39). Consistent with strong capital imports, machinery and equipment investment rose by almost 4 per cent in the quarter. In contrast, the national accounts measure of buildings and structures investment fell by a surprisingly large 3.8 per cent in the September quarter, driven by a large reversal in the previously robust structures component. More recent data on construction activity published by the ABS suggest, however, that this component of investment will be revised up. ", " Indicators of investment intentions suggest that growth in business investment in the first half of 2004 will remain healthy, although intentions have been downgraded slightly in the past three months. Assuming a five-year average realisation ratio, the September quarter ABS capital expenditure (Capex) survey implies a 4.6 per cent fall in nominal investment in machinery and equipment in 2003/04. However, the appreciation of the Australian dollar has reduced prices of imported capital equipment markedly, so this result points to solid growth in real terms. The mining and manufacturing sectors both upgraded their expenditure plans in the September quarter, and are expected to be the main sources of growth in nominal equipment investment in 2003/04, while other sectors tended to downgrade expectations. Survey and other evidence also indicate a rebound in investment expenditure in the farm sector, to be close to their pre-drought levels. ", " Forward-looking indicators of buildings and structures investment suggest that activity will pick up significantly in coming quarters, with construction work done likely to rebound strongly following the fall in activity in the September quarter (Graph 40). Despite the recent deferral and cancellation of a number of projects, the outlook for engineering construction activity remains strong, with the large amount of infrastructure and resource-related work still to be completed likely to sustain growth in activity over most of 2004. Similarly, business surveys and a large stock of work in the pipeline suggest a strong outlook for non-residential building activity in the near term. Further ahead, the outlook is more uncertain, with the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em> indicating a fall in the number of building projects proceeding from the planning stages. ", " Employment has continued to grow strongly, with the average level of employment in the three months to December up by around 1.2 per cent on the previous three months and 2.3 per cent on levels a year earlier <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 41)</span>. Much of this growth has been in full-time employment, which has grown at above-trend rates over the past year. Part-time employment has also continued to grow, but at rates noticeably slower than the average of recent years. ", " The strong employment growth has lowered the unemployment rate to levels not recorded since the late 1980s. At the end of 2003, the unemployment rate stood at 5.6 per cent, ½ a percentage point lower than its level a year earlier (Graph 42). While the measured participation rate has been quite volatile over the past year, in recent months it has stabilised at around 63¾ per cent, a little above the average of the past decade. ", " The gains in employment have been widespread, with the highest rates of increase occurring in Queensland and Tasmania. These states also recorded the largest falls in their unemployment rates over the past year (Table 9), with the Tasmanian unemployment rate converging noticeably on the national average. ", " Employment in the construction industry has continued to expand rapidly over the past year, in line with high levels of construction activity (Table 10). Service-sector employment has also risen strongly, and agricultural employment is up, following the easing of drought conditions in some areas. By contrast, employment in manufacturing has declined. ", " Forward-looking indicators generally suggest a continuation of strong, albeit slightly slower, employment growth <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 43)</span>. Major surveys of employment intentions are above their long-term averages, although the latest readings from the NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys have eased. In the December quarter, the ABS measure of job vacancies rose by 7.9 per cent and modest gains were evident in the print-based vacancy measures published by the ANZ Bank and the DEWR, with the DEWR series edging up further in January. ", " The second half of 2003 saw a partial reversal of factors that had held back Australia's trade performance over the past couple of years. Over that period, slow growth in world demand and the effects of the drought had resulted in weak export outcomes. This, together with rapid growth in imports flowing from strong domestic demand, led to a substantial widening of the deficit on trade in goods and services (Graph 44). Since mid 2003, however, global demand has picked up and drought conditions have eased, which has resulted in a recovery in some components of the volume of exports. The global recovery has also boosted commodity prices, with the terms of trade increasing to levels not seen for the past quarter-century. These developments have led to a narrowing in the trade deficit from 3½ per cent of GDP in the June quarter 2003 to around 3 per cent of GDP by the <span class=\"no-wrap\">end of 2003</span>. Assuming that the net income deficit remains constant as a share of GDP in the December quarter, the current account deficit would have narrowed accordingly, to around 6 per cent of GDP. ", " Recent data suggest that the tentative recovery in exports evident at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> has continued (Graphs 45 and 46). Although the appreciation of the Australian dollar has dampened export prices in Australian dollar terms, the value of exports has edged higher since mid year, rising by around 1¼ per cent in the December quarter. This suggests that since mid 2003 export volumes have largely reversed the 5¼ per cent fall that occurred over the previous 12 months. ", " A key contributor to this recovery has been a revival in service exports. Earnings from services rebounded strongly in the September quarter following the containment of SARS, and rose a further 8¾ per cent in the December quarter. This result was boosted by tourist spending associated with the Rugby World Cup, but even abstracting from this short-term stimulus, both travel-related and other service exports have continued to expand at a healthy pace. Consistent with this, there has been a resurgence in short-term visitor arrivals over the past six months, to levels above those recorded prior to the SARS outbreak and the war in Iraq (Graph 47). ", " Rural export earnings have also begun to recover from their drought-induced weakness, with the value of rural exports rising by around 7 per cent in the December quarter. The value of cereals and meat exports rose sharply in the quarter, though these increases were partially offset by a fall in the value of wool and other rural exports. The overall recovery in rural exports is set to continue in coming quarters with the Australian Bureau of <span class=\"no-wrap\">Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE)</span> forecasting a large rise in farm production in 2003/04, despite a marginal downward revision recently. Cereals exports, particularly wheat, are expected to continue to grow strongly as the winter crop, which has now largely been harvested, is exported. In contrast, herd re-stocking, following the easing of drought conditions in many areas, is expected to weigh on meat and live animal exports in the near term. The outlook for wool and cotton exports is also subdued, because of flock depletion and an ongoing shortage of irrigation water. ", " Earnings from resource exports appear to be stabilising after falling earlier in the year. In the December quarter, earnings increased by ½ per cent, although they remain around 11 per cent lower than a year earlier. The recent improvement is likely to reflect both higher global prices for resources and a pick-up in volumes due to stronger global industrial production, and has occurred despite the appreciation of the Australian dollar lowering prices in Australian dollar terms. The general weakness in resource exports over the past year has been most evident in exports of mineral fuels (excluding coal and related products), which in volume terms fell by almost 10 per cent over the year to the September quarter. In part, this weak outcome reflects supply constraints, as some of Australia's mature oil fields are approaching the end of their productive lives. The volume of metals exports <span class=\"no-wrap\">(excluding gold)</span> has also fallen over the past year. In contrast, exports of metal ores &amp; minerals and coal have risen modestly, and the volume of gold exports was almost 20 per cent higher. Looking forward, expansion in production capacity for some resource commodities, stronger commodity prices and the improvement in the global economy should provide a further boost to export earnings over the coming year (see section on commodity prices and the terms of trade). ", " Unlike the other broad categories of exports, the value of manufactured exports continued to trend downwards in the December quarter, posting its fourth consecutive quarterly fall. This stands in marked contrast to average annual growth of over 10 per cent in the 1990s. In contrast to world prices of commodities, the world prices for many manufactured goods have fallen recently. In addition, the appreciation of the Australian dollar is likely to have restrained export volumes, as well as lowering Australian dollar prices. ", " Strong growth in domestic spending continues to drive solid growth in import volumes. The decline in the relative price of imports resulting from the appreciation of the Australian dollar has also provided some impetus to growth. After moderating in the first half of 2003, the volume of imports expanded by 3¼ per cent in the September quarter, to be 12½ per cent higher over the year, which is well above trend rates of growth. However, given the sharp declines in import prices, the value of imports has fallen over 2003 as a whole. The rise in import volumes in the September quarter was concentrated in service imports, driven by a recovery in travel-related imports following the war in Iraq and the containment of SARS. In contrast, growth in goods imports was more modest. Recent data suggest import volumes increased further in the December quarter, with strong growth in both goods and services imports. ", " The net income deficit recorded a slight rise in the September quarter to $5.6 billion, though at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.8 per cent</span> of GDP, it remains around its average level of the past five years. The decline in world interest rates over the past few years has seen the servicing burden of foreign debt fall to around the levels of the early 1980s. However, this has been offset by rising dividend payments on foreign holdings of Australian equity, flowing from the relatively strong profit performance of Australian companies. This strong performance is also likely to have encouraged net equity inflows into Australia, after several years of net equity outflows. ", " The improvement in the global economy has led to a marked increase in commodity prices in SDR terms since the middle of 2003. The RBA Commodity Price Index rose by 3.8 per cent in SDR terms in the three months to January, to be nearly 10 per cent higher than its recent trough in May 2003 and nearly 23 per cent higher than the low levels prevailing in 1999 (Table 11; Graph 48). While the appreciation of the Australian dollar has reduced commodity prices in Australian dollar terms from their most recent peak, they remain close to their average of the past decade. ", " The increase in base metals prices has been particularly pronounced, with prices up by 15.3 per cent in SDR terms in the six months to January to be close to their highest levels in 15 years, and also up in Australian dollar terms. Nickel prices have been especially strong, rising by more than 70 per cent in SDR terms over the past 12 months and by nearly 170 per cent since their trough in late 2001, largely in response to robust demand from China's expanding stainless-steel industry. Copper prices have risen sharply in recent months amid tight supply and low worldwide inventory levels. The prices of other resource commodities have also increased in the three months to January, particularly alumina and gold. The recent annual contract negotiations between suppliers and Japanese steelmakers for iron ore delivered price increases of nearly 20 per cent in US dollar terms, with significant increases expected in contract negotiations for coal over coming months. ", " World prices for rural commodities have also increased steadily in the past six months. In both SDR and <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar</span> terms, they are higher than the trough in June 2003, but remain below the drought-induced peaks of 2002. Beef prices rose over the second half of 2003 as US demand recovered from earlier weakness. More recently, BSE-related restrictions on US beef imports in many countries have also boosted prices significantly. Cotton prices have increased substantially in the past three months following a poor crop in China, while wheat prices are also up since the middle of last year, following adverse weather conditions in Europe. ", " In the three months to January, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price averaged around <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$32.50</span> per barrel, which is 8 per cent higher than the previous three months (Graph 49). This increase follows the reduction in OPEC's oil production quotas, effective from last November, and low oil inventories in the US. More recently, the depreciation of the US dollar has helped induce a sharp rise in prices to levels well above OPEC's target range; in Australian dollar terms, oil prices remain below recent averages. ", " Unlike in previous upswings in global demand and commodity prices, world prices of Australia's imports, particularly manufactured goods, have remained quite weak. This largely reflects the rapid expansion in productive capacity in Asia, coupled with ongoing declines in the prices of information-technology products. The result has been a <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> increase in Australia's terms of trade over the year to the September quarter, to its highest level in over 25 years (Graph 50). Further increases are likely, given the recent upward pressure on commodity prices. ", " The increase in the cash rate target in early December came as little surprise to financial markets. At the time of the increase in the target from 5 to 5¼ per cent, markets had priced in not only that increase but a couple of further increases over the coming year. This outlook was underpinned by ongoing strength in the domestic economy and continuing evidence of improvement in the global economy. ", " Subsequently, expectations of further moves in monetary policy were scaled back somewhat, reflecting the rise in the Australian dollar and indications from the Federal Reserve that monetary policy in the United States was unlikely to be tightened in the near term. Money markets nevertheless still expect a further 25 basis point rise in the cash rate later this year (Graph 51). ", " Yields on 10-year bonds reached a 17-month high of 6.0 per cent in early December before falling back to around 5.7 per cent, albeit around 110 basis points higher than their trough in mid June 2003. Real yields have moved similarly to nominal yields over the same period, with yields on 10-year inflation-linked bonds currently around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent (Graph 52)</span>. ", " The yield curve has flattened since the release of the last <em>Statement</em>, reflecting the December tightening in monetary policy and the fall in longer-term yields (Graph 53). The spread between 10-year bond yields and the cash rate is currently around 45 basis points, compared with more than 100 basis points on average over the past decade (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#assessment-of-financial-conditions\">Assessment of Financial Conditions</a>’). ", " The spread between 10-year Australian and US bond yields has fluctuated around 150 basis points over the past few months, which is around 50 basis points above its average for the past few years (Graph 54). ", " Spreads on corporate bonds (relative to government bonds) have risen a little in recent months, in contrast to the falls in many other countries. The available evidence suggests that this does not reflect a perceived deterioration in credit risk on these bonds. Rather, the increase in spreads appears to reflect both tightness in the Commonwealth Government bond market (where supply remains limited and demand by foreign investors appears to have increased) and upward pressure on swap rates (one benchmark against which corporate bonds are priced) as companies have sought to lock in fixed-rate borrowings due to expected increases in interest rates. Spreads between corporate bonds and swap rates have generally narrowed (Graph 55). ", " Indicator rates on variable-rate housing and business loans are 50 basis points higher than at end October, having increased in line with the 25 basis point increases in the cash rate in November and December last year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 12)</span>. The implementation lag of these increases for existing customers was around one week, similar to the experience of recent monetary policy changes. The predominant rate for banks' variable-rate housing loans is now <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.05 per cent</span>, slightly above its average for the past five years. ", " Fixed rates on small business loans have increased by around 25 basis points since the time of the last <em>Statement</em>. Over the same period, fixed rates on housing loans have risen by around 50 basis points (Graph 56). ", " The larger increase in housing fixed rates may in part reflect banks moving to rebuild margins lost over most of the second half of 2003 (when fixed rates increased by less than fixed-rate wholesale funding costs), on the back of a marked increase in the demand for fixed-rate housing loans. The share of new housing loans taken out at fixed rates increased from a low of 6.3 per cent in June 2003 to 15.2 per cent in November (Graph 57). At present, interest rates on variable-rate housing loans are around the same as 3-year fixed rates. ", " The Australian share market has shown little net change since the time of the last <em>Statement</em>, compared with some sizeable increases in overseas markets over the same period (Graph 58). The increase in the Australian dollar may be part of the reason for this, as investors assume the appreciation will have a negative effect on companies with offshore earnings. On the other hand, since the mid 1990s the Australian share market has shown a consistent tendency to be more stable than major offshore markets (that is, fall less when overseas markets are falling and rise less when overseas markets are rising) and recent developments may simply be a continuation of that pattern. The Australian share market is only 7 per cent below its peak, a much stronger outcome than in any of the major industrial countries. ", " The performance of the sector indices since end October 2003 has been mixed (Graph 59). The energy sector has been the strongest performer, experiencing gains of 11 per cent due to favourable developments regarding increased sales of LNG to the US and the discovery of new oil fields. The financials index has risen slightly, with increases in banks and real estate companies tempered by falls in insurers and diversified financials. The materials sector is 5 per cent lower than at end October and has shown considerable volatility during the period because of the conflicting effects of strong increases in metals prices and concerns about the appreciation of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar</span>. The share prices of export-oriented manufacturers have generally fallen. ", " The Australian price-earnings (P/E) ratio remains around 20 (Graph 60), a little higher than its long-run average. Australian dividend yields have remained steady over the past three months at around 4 per cent. ", " Bond issuance by private Australian entities was robust in the December quarter, with continued strong issuance in both the domestic and offshore markets totalling $27 billion (Table 13). Financial institutions were the main issuers, accounting for almost half the quarterly total. Issuance of asset-backed securities eased in the December quarter, after a strong September quarter, but remained at high levels. Total gross issuance for all of 2003 increased by almost 40 per cent to $124 billion. ", " Around two-thirds of Australian entities' issuance in the December quarter was into offshore markets, broadly consistent with that seen in previous quarters. As is usual, most offshore issuance by Australian borrowers was denominated in foreign currencies, with companies typically using swap markets to convert the proceeds back to Australian dollars. The share of foreign currency issuance denominated in US dollars remained low by historical standards at just over 50 per cent; financial institutions issued substantial amounts in euros, pounds sterling and Canadian dollars. Australian entities' offshore issuance is estimated to have included a record $5.2 billion into the US private placement market in the December quarter. ", " Non-residents issued a total of almost $7 billion of Australian dollar denominated debt in the December quarter. European and US financial institutions again dominated issuance in Australia, while supranationals and government agencies accounted for most of the offshore Australian dollar issuance. ", " In January, Australian entities issued a further $12 billion of bonds, mainly in offshore markets, and non-residents also continued to be active. ", " The total level of non-government debt outstanding in the domestic market increased by $9 billion to $144 billion in the December quarter (Graph 61). In contrast, Commonwealth Government bonds outstanding were little changed at $52 billion, while state government bonds fell $1 billion to $50 billion. ", " There was some decline in the average credit quality of issuance by Australian entities in the December quarter, though it remained high by international standards. The decline reflected a moderation in asset-backed issuance, which is largely in the form of AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities, and a pick-up in A-rated issuance into offshore markets. ", " Issuance of hybrid securities (securities which are a mixture of both debt and equity) remained solid in the December quarter, with $4 billion issued, mainly in offshore markets (Graph 62). Almost $9 billion of hybrid securities were issued in the second half of 2003, with the major banks being the biggest issuers. ", " The growth rate of total credit increased further in the second half of 2003, reaching its highest level in more than a decade (Graph 63). Total credit grew by 15 per cent over the year to December, and at an annualised <span class=\"no-wrap\">rate of 19 per cent</span> over the second half of the year, reflecting strong growth in credit to both the household and business sectors. ", " Household credit increased at an annual rate of 23 per cent over the six months to December, and continues to be underpinned by strength in housing credit. Lending has grown rapidly for owner-occupiers and even more so for investors – increasing at an annualised rate of 33 per cent over the six months to December. As noted above, growth in housing lending at fixed rates has picked up appreciably in recent months, reflecting the anticipation by borrowers of higher variable interest rates. In contrast to housing credit, the growth rate of personal credit has slowed somewhat over recent months, to an annualised rate of around 12 per cent over the six months to December, compared with 16 per cent over the six months to September; the slowdown in the growth rate of fixed-term and credit card lending was particularly marked. ", " A fall in housing loan approvals in November, and signs of a slowdown in the housing market, may presage some moderation in the pace of credit growth over coming months. However, the current high <em>level</em> of loan approvals suggests that housing credit growth will nonetheless remain very fast in the near term (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a> in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic Conditions</a>’). ", " As with housing credit, the growth rate of business credit has picked up strongly since the middle of the year. This follows a period of two years in which business credit growth was unusually low. Over the six months to December, business credit increased at an annualised rate of 13 per cent, reflecting strong growth in commercial loans, commercial paper and promissory notes, and a modest recovery in bank bills on issue. ", " On the liability side of intermediaries' balance sheets, the growth rate of the broader monetary aggregates has also risen in recent months, to an annualised rate of 15 per cent over the six months to December (Graph 64). Nevertheless, the difference between the rates of growth of credit and broad money has continued to widen, reflecting increased reliance on other funding sources, including offshore borrowing. ", " Equity raisings were very strong in the December quarter, driven by record raisings through initial public offerings <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 65)</span>. Around 60 companies listed on the ASX for the first time in the December quarter, raising a total of $6 billion. As well as some high-profile large issues, many smaller companies also listed, with more than one-half of the total number of listings being companies that raised less than $10 million each. Several were small resource companies that were taking advantage of the current period of strong metals prices and buoyant equity markets. ", " Capital raisings from other types of equity issuance, which include rights issues, placements and dividend reinvestment plans, were also strong in the quarter. Rights issues were dominated by AMP's $1.2 billion issue. December quarter placements were particularly strong for non-financials, while equity raised through dividend reinvestment plans was solid for both financial and non-financial companies. ", " The large amount of equity raised was offset to some extent by an increase in the value of buybacks in the quarter, which was at its highest level since June 2000. This result was driven by the large buybacks of Telstra and Foster's Group Ltd in the month of December. ", " As discussed in earlier chapters, credit grew by 15 per cent over the year to December. This rate of growth is the fastest in over a decade and is considerably higher than that being recorded in most other countries. While the lagged effects of the increases in interest rates in November and December are yet to flow through, the continuing rapid pace of credit growth is prima facie evidence that financial conditions remain expansionary, especially when viewed in the context of lending rates that are still below the average of the past decade. ", " Credit expansion continues to be primarily driven by borrowing by the household sector, mainly for the purchase of housing. Over the year to December, total household credit was up by 21 per cent, with annualised growth over the final three months of the year at a slightly faster rate. The strong growth in household borrowing looks likely to continue at least into the early months of 2004, with housing loan approvals remaining at a very high level, despite falling in November for the first time in more than a year. While there have been some reports of financial institutions tightening lending requirements, particularly for loans to purchase inner-city apartments, finance generally remains readily available on attractive terms. There are few signs that the household sector is having difficulty meeting its financial obligations, with personal bankruptcies at relatively low levels and the share of households that have fallen behind in their mortgage repayments at around historical lows. ", " Business credit growth has also picked up over recent months, after being subdued for the previous two years. Over the second half of 2003, the level of business credit outstanding increased at an annualised rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span>, the fastest pace for some years. The stronger outcomes are consistent with the generally positive readings of current business conditions and the recent robust growth in business investment. While some businesses, particularly in the property sector, are reporting that finance has become more difficult to obtain, finance in general remains readily available. More broadly, financial conditions in the business sector are relatively favourable. Corporate balance sheets are in a healthy state, consistent with strong growth in profitability, relatively low levels of debt, a recent pick-up in equity raisings, and strong gains in share prices since March 2003. The healthy state of corporate balance sheets overall is also apparent in corporate bond spreads, which remain at relatively low levels. ", " The consistently strong credit growth suggests that the level of interest rates has not posed a significant hurdle to those households and businesses wishing to borrow over recent years. While the 25 basis point increases in November and December have brought the cash rate closer to its average level of the past ten years – a period in which the economy has recorded average annual growth of 3.9 per cent – the rate still remains slightly below the average over this period (Graph 66). Lending rates are also below average, reflecting both the level of the cash rate and the compression of interest rate margins over the past decade. The same is true in real terms, with generally stable inflation expectations over this period. ", " While the combination of rapid credit growth and below-average interest rates suggests that financial conditions remain expansionary, the slope of the yield curve, as measured by the spread between the yield on 10-year bonds and the cash rate, suggests a somewhat different picture. With the cash rate up by 50 basis points in late 2003 and yields on 10-year bonds down a little over recent months, the spread has narrowed since early November to stand at around 50 basis points (Graph 67). By itself, this below-average spread might normally be taken to imply slightly tighter-than-average conditions, although a more likely interpretation is that bond yields have been held down by offshore bond-market developments reflecting expectations that short-term interest rates around the world will remain below average for some time. ", " Another financial influence on economic conditions is the exchange rate. As discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International                          and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’, the Australian dollar has continued to appreciate over recent months, rising on a trade-weighted basis by 5 per cent since early November and 21 per cent over the past year. After adjusting for differences in inflation rates between Australia and its trading partners, the level of the exchange rate in the December quarter was around 10 per cent above the average of the post-float period, and it has subsequently appreciated further. ", " The appreciation has occurred against the backdrop of a recovery in the world economy and, importantly, a continuing increase in Australia's terms of trade. In the September quarter, the terms of trade reached its highest level in 26 years, and it is likely to have risen further over recent months given the continued strength of international commodity prices. The appreciation over the past couple of years has returned the real exchange rate to a level broadly consistent with its historical relationship with the terms of trade, after a period of unusual weakness in the currency between 1999 and 2002 (Graph 68). All else equal, the stronger exchange rate would have a dampening influence on economic activity, although an important offset to this is the related improvement in the terms of trade and stronger global demand. ", " While the Australian dollar has appreciated against the currencies of most of Australia's major trading partners, the appreciation has been particularly pronounced against the US dollar and the US-dollar-linked currencies of east Asia. In inflation-adjusted terms, the value of the Australian dollar is at a record level against a trade-weighted basket of east Asian currencies, with a number of these currencies having depreciated markedly at the time of the Asian crisis, and again more recently (Graph 69). The appreciation of the Australian dollar has been less marked against the euro, and the currencies of a number of countries that Australia competes with in international markets. ", " The Consumer Price Index rose by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter, to be 2.4 per cent higher over the year. This represents a slowing in the rate of inflation from around 3 per cent a year ago (Graph 70). The various measures of underlying inflation recorded slightly lower outcomes in the quarter, although on a year-ended basis they show inflation at a similar rate to the headline measure (Table 14; Graph 71). The exception to this is the price index for market goods and services (excluding volatile items), which increased by 1.8 per cent over the year, reflecting weaker quarterly growth earlier in 2003 (relative to other measures). Overall, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is at, or slightly below, 2½ per cent. ", " The slowing in all measures of inflation over the past year reflects the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar. This can be seen in the significant decline in the rate of inflation of the prices of tradable goods (Graph 72). Indeed, in the December quarter, tradables prices (excluding petrol and food) declined by 0.5 per cent, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.8 per cent</span> lower over the year, with downward pressure clearly evident in a broad range of expenditure categories. Most notable were the declines over the past year in prices of audio, visual and computing <span class=\"no-wrap\">equipment (21 per cent)</span>, motor vehicles (2.6 per cent), men's clothing (1.8 per cent), footwear (3.2 per cent), and some components of household furnishings, supplies and services. The declines in the December quarter of prices of clothing and footwear (0.2 per cent), and household furnishings, supplies and services (0.1 per cent) were particularly noteworthy because the prices of these items typically rise towards the end of the year. The exchange rate appreciation also helped to offset an increase in international crude oil prices, so that in the December quarter retail fuel prices fell by around 0.9 per cent. ", " In contrast to the price of tradables, the price of non-tradable goods and services rose by almost 4½ per cent over the past year, the fastest growth rate in a decade. An important factor contributing to this outcome has been the increase in housing-related prices, which overall were up by 4.7 per cent in year-ended terms. This increase was largely attributable to house purchase costs – which rose by 1 per cent in the quarter, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.4 per cent</span> higher over the year – in turn reflecting higher costs of labour and materials. Cost pressures are also evident in a number of service industries, with the price of education, and some recreational and personal services having risen by around 4 per cent over the year, while the price of health services has increased at more than double this pace. ", " Another important, although more temporary influence on inflation recently has been a large rise in the price of food, which was up by 1.8 per cent in the December quarter, and by 3.4 per cent over the year. Adverse weather patterns in the eastern states contributed to especially sharp rises in both fruit and vegetable prices, which were up by over 10 per cent in the December quarter. There were also significant rises in the prices of some categories of meat. ", " Producer price inflation remains modest with large declines in the prices of imported items offsetting the growth of domestic prices; overall final stage prices rose by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter, to be 1.0 per cent higher over the year (Table 15; Graph 73). The appreciation has led to significant price declines of imported items, with prices at all stages of production down by around 3 per cent in the quarter and almost 13 per cent over the year. ", " In contrast to import prices, recent outcomes for domestic prices have varied across the different stages of production. Upward pressures have been most evident at the final stage, where prices rose by 0.8 per cent in the quarter, to be 4.2 per cent higher over the year. Construction costs have been rising particularly strongly, increasing by 1.3 per cent in the quarter and 7.2 per cent over the year. Although the quarterly growth rate fell from September to December, construction costs remain under upward pressure from both materials and labour costs. Price pressures in food manufacturing and agriculture are also playing a role in pushing up domestic final stage prices. ", " Most labour cost indicators suggest that wages growth edged up in the second half of 2003, consistent with signs that labour-market conditions remain firm. In the September quarter, the wage cost index (WCI) for total pay increased by 1.0 per cent, to be 3.7 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 74). The WCI for the public sector continues to rise more quickly (at a rate of 4.7 per cent in year-ended terms) than that for the private sector <span class=\"no-wrap\">(3.2 per cent)</span>. This divergence has been partly driven by significant wage increases in the health and community services sector. ", " Forward-looking data on new wage agreements also point to firm wages growth, and suggest some narrowing of the gap between public and private sector wage outcomes. Data from the Department of Employment and Workplace <span class=\"no-wrap\">Relations (DEWR)</span> indicate that average annualised wages growth in certified new enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) was 4.1 per cent in the September quarter. This follows a 4.3 per cent reading in June and remains at the higher end of outcomes over the past few years. It was also above the average of wage increases for currently active agreements, which was 3.8 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Recent outcomes were similar in the public and private sectors, after a period in which public sector EBAs had delivered higher wage gains than in the private sector. ", " The latest NAB business survey shows total labour costs increasing at close to their fastest pace of the past five years, although still considerably slower than in the mid 1990s. The survey also reports that an increasing number of firms are having difficulty attracting suitable labour (Graph 75). This is consistent with results from the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers and, more generally, the decline in the unemployment rate to around the lowest levels of the past two decades. In the construction sector, subcontracting rates are continuing to rise significantly faster than measures of wages, placing upward pressure on labour costs in this industry. For office workers, data from Mercer's December Quarterly Salary Review show a slight firming in the growth rate of base salaries, to around 4.3 per cent in year-ended terms, compared with slightly less than 4 per cent earlier in 2003. ", " Recent surveys of financial market economists and union officials both point to a decline in inflation expectations over the past three months. Results from the Bank's latest quarterly survey of financial market economists show that the median inflation forecast is 2.1 per cent over the year to June 2004, before picking up to 2.4 per cent over the year to June 2005; forecasts for both periods are lower than they were in November 2003 by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.1 percentage points (Table 16)</span>. The inflation expectations of trade union officials are around <span class=\"no-wrap\">½ a percentage</span> point higher than those of financial market economists in both years. ", " Business surveys also suggest a decline in inflation expectations. According to the NAB business survey, retail prices are expected to rise by 0.2 per cent in the March quarter, somewhat below the outcomes of recent years <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 76)</span>. In contrast, the volatile Melbourne Institute survey shows that the median expectation for consumer inflation over the coming year increased to 4.6 per cent in January, after falling over recent months to a six-year low in December. Looking through the volatility of the past few months, this measure appears to be consistent with its average level of the inflation-targeting period. ", " The longer-term expectations of financial market participants have been little changed over the past year and a half. Expectations of inflation, as measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, remain at around 2.3 per cent. ", " As indicated above, the Bank judges the rate of underlying inflation to be at, or slightly below, 2½ per cent. This represents a slight fall from the year-ended rate in the September quarter, and is consistent with the expectation expressed at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> that the appreciation of the exchange rate would gradually flow through into consumer prices. With the dampening effect of the appreciation on domestic inflation still having further to run, our current assessment is that underlying inflation will decline to around 1½ per cent during 2004 (assuming the exchange rate remains stable at around its current level). Then, as the effects of the appreciation begin to wane, inflation is forecast to rise to around 2½ per cent in 2005. Given the likely strength of the economy, domestically sourced price pressures are expected to remain relatively strong, with inflation projected to be on an upward trajectory through 2005. ", " Year-ended CPI inflation is likely to track underlying inflation relatively closely over the forecast horizon, although in the next two quarters the year-ended outcomes for headline inflation will be affected by the volatility in oil prices during the first half of 2003. ", " Over recent months, the downside risks to inflation posed by developments in the global economy have eased considerably. While there are risks in both directions around the inflation forecast, the short-term risks appear weighted to the downside, while longer-term risks are more prominent on the upside. In the short run, the inflation rate could decline more than forecast if the exchange rate were to appreciate further, or if the degree of pass-through is greater than expected due to strong competition in the retail sector. Such outcomes could push inflation lower in 2004 or delay the anticipated pick-up in inflation further into 2005. The upside risks to the inflation outlook appear more prominent towards the end of the forecast horizon and relate to the strength of economic activity and the impact of this on upstream inflationary pressures and wage outcomes. The global pick-up in demand and activity could, in due course, start to provide upside risks to world inflation, further lifting commodity prices and prices of traded goods and services more generally. Also, if domestic economic activity and demand were to be even stronger than expected, given the existing strength of the labour market, upward pressure on labour costs could emerge, eventually pushing inflation higher. ", "the Bank of England increased its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent in November. The move was widely seen as unwinding the ‘precautionary’ cut in rates in July;", "The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its policy rate by 25 basis points in late January, citing domestic inflationary pressures; and", "the Bank of Canada lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 2.50 per cent in January after growth in economic activity in Canada had disappointed in the second half of 2003.", " A positive development in the global economy over the past couple of years has been the substantial rebound in US corporate profits. Although interpretation of earnings data remains difficult, due to methodological differences in the construction of the various measures (for details see <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2002/feb/1.html#box-a\">Box A</a>, <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, February 2002), the rebound is evident in both national accounts and financial reporting-based estimates. ", " The national accounting estimate of profits remains the best available as it is consistent over time and captures all profits earned by US companies. After falling 20 per cent in the four years between <span class=\"no-wrap\">September 1997</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">September 2001</span>, national accounts gross profits rebounded 58 per cent over the two years to September 2003 (Graph A1). Over the year to September last year (the most recent data available) gross profits grew by 25 per cent – a significantly stronger rise than seen in the recovery from the early-1990s recession. ", " As a consequence of this rise, the profit share of US output has also recovered (Graph A2). After falling to 7.1 per cent of GDP in the September quarter of 2001(near historical lows), the profit share recovered to 10.1 per cent by the September quarter 2003 – well above the 8.4 per cent average since 1970. ", " The strong growth observed in the national accounting measure of profits has also been reflected in financial measures of corporate earnings such as ‘as reported’ earnings and ‘operating’ earnings (Graph A3). ", " The profits recovery has been driven by continued strong productivity growth in conjunction with subdued compensation growth (due to the weak labour market), which has seen unit labour costs fall by 5 per cent since June 2001 – the largest fall on record (Graph A4). ", " The restoration of the profit share has been an important factor behind the recovery in investment spending seen over recent quarters. ", " The primary measure of the household sector's debt-servicing burden is the ratio of aggregate interest payments to disposable income.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnb1\" id=\"rb1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " In calculating this ratio over the past year, the RBA has been making two adjustments to the aggregate interest payments series published by the ABS. As discussed in <a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2003/may/1.html#box-c\">Box C</a> in the May 2003 <em>Statement</em>, the first adjustment has been to add back to the published series the imputed financial intermediation service charge deducted by the ABS. The second has been to adjust interest payments upwards from the December <span class=\"no-wrap\">quarter 2000</span> onwards to correct for the fact that movements in the average interest rate implied by the published series appeared inconsistent with movements in market rates. Over 2002/03, this second adjustment increased the total debt-servicing ratio by around ¾ of a percentage point, shifting the profile of the ratio from being relatively flat, to one that was trending upwards. ", " The ABS has recently reviewed the interest paid series and published substantial revisions in the September <span class=\"no-wrap\">quarter 2003</span> national accounts (Graph B1). These revisions reflect the incorporation of new data from financial institutions. The new estimates confirm the upward trend in the debt-servicing ratio over recent years evident in the earlier RBA estimates, with movements in the implied average interest rate now consistent with those in market rates. As a result, the RBA will no longer make the second adjustment to the ABS's figures. It will however continue to make the adjustment for the imputed financial intermediation service charge, given that the published data still exclude that part of interest payments attributed to this charge. The financial intermediation service charge currently increases the ratio by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.4 percentage</span> points, of which around half is attributable to housing-related debt. ", " The revised data including the financial intermediation service charge suggest a slightly higher debt-servicing ratio over recent years than that indicated by the RBA's earlier estimates, with the revised ratio averaging ¼–½ of a percentage point higher over recent quarters. The implied average interest rate on housing debt in the September quarter 2003 was around 6½ per cent, around the same level as the banks' standard variable lending rate at the time. The overall implied interest rate on household debt is slightly higher, at around 7 per cent, reflecting relatively higher interest rates on households' consumer debt. ", " The value of housing loan approvals and movements in housing credit outstanding track one another <span class=\"no-wrap\">closely (Graph C1)</span>, although the value of approvals is typically at least double the dollar value of the movement in credit, due to repayments of principal and drawdowns of existing facilities.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnc1\" id=\"rc1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Typically there is a 6–10 week delay between when a loan approval is recorded and property settlement takes place, so movements in credit lag the level of approvals. Indeed, empirical work suggests that it can take up to four months for the effect of a change in the level of approvals to fully flow through into a change in the movement in credit, with around 40 per cent of the effect occurring within one month, and 75 per cent within two months (Graph C2). ", " Given the relationship between the level of housing loan approvals and the dollar-value movement in housing credit, it is possible to derive a relationship between the <em>percentage change</em> in approvals and the <em class=\"no-wrap\">growth rate</em> of credit. Again, empirical work suggests that, at current levels of approvals and credit growth, a once-only 10 per cent decline in approvals would reduce the monthly rate of credit growth by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 of a percentage point</span> after about three months (Graph C3).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnc2\" id=\"rc2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> ", " To put these numbers into perspective it is useful to consider the likely impact on credit growth of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> decline in the value of housing loan approvals recorded in November 2003. Assuming that approvals remain at their new lower level, housing credit growth would be expected to slow from a <span class=\"no-wrap\">three-month-annualised</span> rate of 25 per cent to a still rapid rate of around 18 per cent by mid 2005 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph C4)</span>. ", " It is also useful to look at the effect on credit growth of a number of other scenarios for loan approvals. If, for example, approvals were to fall by 2 per cent each month until the end of 2004, and remain constant thereafter, the rate of housing credit growth would be expected to slow to a three-month-annualised rate of 13 per cent by mid 2005. Under this scenario, approvals would fall by a cumulative 27 per cent from their October 2003 peak, to around the level recorded in early 2003. ", " If instead approvals were to fall by 4 per cent per month, housing credit growth would be expected to slow to a three-month-annualised rate of 9 per cent by mid 2005. Under this scenario, the cumulative decline in approvals would be 44 per cent, which, while large, would not be inconsistent with declines in previous cycles. If instead, however, approvals were to fall by 8 per cent per month until end 2004, housing credit growth would be expected to slow to around 5 per cent by mid 2005. Such a large decline in approvals is clearly outside the range of previous experience. ", " Finally, rather than falling, if the value of loan approvals was to grow by 2 per cent per month from the November 2003 level until the end of 2004, housing credit growth would be expected to remain at around its current rate of close to 25 per cent. ", " At the national level there are three main sources of data on house prices: the ABS, the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) and the Commonwealth Bank (CBA). All three sources provide price measures for the capital cities. The ABS also publishes an Australia-wide measure, while the RBA constructs national measures using the REIA and CBA city-based data, using the number of capital-city households as weights. ", " All three series are based on transaction prices (Graph D1). They are published quarterly, although some commercial data providers produce monthly equivalents for their clients. Of these three measures only the ABS series attempts to control for changes in the geographic composition of houses that are sold during the quarter. None of these three price indices adjusts for improvement in the average quality of houses through time. ", " Residex, a commercial provider of house price data, constructs series for Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane using data from repeat sales of individual properties. These repeat-sales indices control for compositional shifts in the stock of houses sold in each quarter, and changes in the average quality of newer homes compared with older homes. They can therefore be useful for understanding longer-term trends. However, the series cannot adjust for the effects of renovations on the quality and price of existing homes, and recent observations can be subject to significant revisions. ", " The ABS, Residex and REIA series record prices at settlement and are based on data provided to the land titles offices in each state, except in Victoria where the ABS and REIA use surveys of real estate agents. In contrast, the CBA series is derived from house purchases made by CBA home loan customers, with prices typically being recorded close to the date at which contracts are exchanged. It is available earlier than the other series, although given the smaller samples involved, it tends to be relatively volatile. Currently all three of the national series show prices rising at a relatively fast pace over the latest year for which data are available, though they also show that the rates of increase have come down from their most recent peaks. ", " Given that price movements can vary significantly across markets, it is also important to monitor price indices for specific geographical areas. Over the past year or so, particular attention has been paid to the inner-city apartment markets. Data for both private treaty and auction prices are available from a number of industry and commercial providers, although care needs to be exercised in interpreting movements because the samples can be quite small. While these data at times show marked differences across areas, they suggest that prices in a number of inner-city localities, including Melbourne's CBD and the City of Sydney, had come off their peaks by the September quarter (Graph D2). Whether this portends a lasting change in trend is unclear. ", " As noted above, most house price data are obtained from land titles offices, with prices recorded as at the time of settlement. The use of data from land titles offices means that there are significant lags between the time when sales occur and when a reliable median of those prices can be estimated. This reflects the typical lag of at least six weeks between sale and settlement, as well as, in some states, significant reporting and processing lags. ", " A more timely indicator of price movements is provided by auction results, which are available from a number of commercial data providers soon after the auction takes place. These measures are most useful for Melbourne and Sydney markets, where auctions can account for up to a half and a quarter of all sales respectively. As discussed in the body of this <em>Statement</em>, recent auction data suggest that prices were relatively flat over the final months of 2003. In interpreting these data, however, it should be kept in mind that the samples are considerably smaller than those used to construct the quarterly price series discussed above, and that auctions tend to be concentrated in the higher-value end of the market. In Sydney, for example, the median auction price is close to double the median private treaty price. "], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2004/feb/1.html"},

In Australia, growth remains solid, and a turning point appears to have been reached in the housing market after the overheated levels of late last year, though it is still unclear how this will evolve. These developments suggest a lessening of the main risks to the Australian economy, and improve the prospects for more balanced growth in the period ahead. ", " International events in recent months have been dominated by the US economy, where stronger employment data have helped to confirm that the recovery is becoming more firmly established. With business investment and profits growing strongly and business confidence high, the US recovery has now broadened well beyond its initial reliance on consumer spending. Another important development in the US has been a pick-up in the latest inflation figures. While core inflation remains low at this stage, it is looking increasingly likely that the downward trend evident over the past year or two has ended. As discussed below, financial markets viewed these events as bringing forward the likely timing of monetary policy tightening in the US. ", " Data from other parts of the world, with the exception of the euro area, also point to increased momentum in recent months. China's economy is growing at an exceptional pace, prompting the Chinese authorities to express concerns about overheating and to take action aimed at restraining the growth of bank lending. The Japanese economy is enjoying its strongest growth for a decade, and other parts of east and south Asia are also experiencing strong economic conditions, helped in part by the growth in China, the US and other export markets. In addition, these countries, which effectively form part of a ‘dollar bloc’, are receiving considerable stimulus from low interest rates and from the lower US dollar. Conditions in the euro area remain disappointing, though they are probably consistent with modest growth in GDP in the first quarter of 2004, about the same as in the two previous quarters. ", " Taken together, these developments confirm that the global economy has picked up significantly over the past year. This situation has put upward pressure on international commodity prices, many of which have increased considerably over this period, particularly in the resources sector, a trend that will benefit Australian exporters. ", " The main factor influencing financial markets in recent months has been changing assessments of the timing of the first interest rate increase by the US Fed. Earlier in the year, the prospects for a rate increase seemed to diminish after the publication of relatively weak job numbers. Over the past month, expectations of a rate increase have been brought forward again. This started with the release of a strong March employment report, and was reinforced by the subsequent publication of other strong economic data and a relatively large increase in the CPI. Markets now think that there is some chance that the Fed will raise rates at its late June meeting, and have fully priced in a move by the time of its mid-August meeting. ", " Talk of US monetary tightening over the past month prompted a rise in market interest rates in Australia, particularly for longer-term securities, and a fall in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar. However, markets have taken the view that any flow-through of rises in US interest rates to Australia should be limited, as Australian rates are already close to normal levels. The normalisation of interest rates by the Fed is therefore expected to result in a narrowing of the interest rate differential between the two countries, especially at the short end. The exchange rate has declined recently and is now around 9 per cent below its mid-February peak against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar;</span> in trade-weighted terms it has fallen by a smaller amount, as some of the fall against the US dollar has been a reflection of recent US dollar strength. ", " Economic data in Australia indicate that the economy has continued to grow solidly in 2004, in line with the outlook described in the February <em>Statement</em>. Household spending has been strong over the past year, though easing a little in the most recent months. Consumer confidence is close to its highest level in a decade and consumer spending is likely to continue to be supported by rising employment and real wages. In the housing construction industry, forward indicators continue to suggest a mild easing in activity later in the year, though its extent will be mitigated by a large stock of work yet to be done and strong demand for renovations. Broader indicators of the growth of the economy have remained firm in 2004. Employment has registered further sizeable gains, continuing a run of generally strong figures since around the middle of last year, while the unemployment rate has fallen further. Business surveys reported above-average conditions in the March quarter, though down a little from the end of last year. ", " Present indications are that overall growth of the economy is likely to remain strong, with the mix between domestic and external sources of growth shifting to a more sustainable position over time. The growth of domestic demand, though still strong, is likely to ease from the unusually rapid pace seen in the past couple of years. At the same time, with international data indicating a significant expansion in most parts of the global economy, a more favourable environment for export growth is emerging. Consistent with this, export volumes have resumed growth from the trough reached in the June quarter of 2003, though this is partly attributable to the recovery in rural exports from drought-affected levels. ", " The main source of risk to the export outlook apparent in the recent period has been associated with the appreciation of the exchange rate, and particularly the rapid appreciation that took place during 2003 and into the early weeks of this year. Had it continued, this posed the risk of significantly dampening the effects of the global recovery on Australia's export performance. But, with the exchange rate having drifted lower recently and the prospect of US interest rates starting to return to normal, this risk now seems less severe than a few months ago. A further risk, which seems to have increased recently, is that persistent dry conditions in a number of parts of the country may set back prospects for further recovery in the farm sector. ", " Australia's inflation rate for the present is still being held down by the effects of last year's exchange rate appreciation. In the March quarter the CPI increased by 0.9 per cent and by 2.0 per cent over the year. While this outcome was slightly higher than expected, the annual inflation rate has declined over the past year from a peak of just over 3 per cent. There continues to be a sharp contrast between externally and domestically sourced inflation pressures. Reflecting the exchange rate appreciation, prices of tradable items declined over the latest year, while domestically sourced inflation pressures remained relatively strong, with prices of non-tradable items continuing to rise at an annual rate of around 4 per cent. The Bank's assessment remains that the pass-through of these exchange rate effects will dampen inflation a little further over the coming year and that inflation will then start to increase gradually as these effects fade. Inflation is now expected to decline to around 1¾ per cent at the end of this year, rising to around 2½ per cent by the end of 2005. ", " The other major source of risk to the general economic outlook in Australia is associated with developments in credit growth and in the housing market. The run-up in credit growth and the associated boom in house prices in recent years presented two implications for the economy: they tended to boost growth in the short term, but carried the risk of a damaging correction if they continued too long. ", " With the heat now coming out of the credit and housing markets, this risk has diminished over recent months. Housing finance approvals peaked at around $15 billion a month in October, and have since declined to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">$12 billion</span> recently. This is still a very high level and will need to fall much further to bring the growth of housing credit back to a reasonably sustainable pace. Nonetheless it is encouraging that housing finance has at least begun the process of correcting from the exceptionally high levels reached last year. There are also recent indications that house prices may have reached their peak. After the rapid increases recorded during 2003, available indicators for the March quarter 2004 point to falling prices in most of the major cities, although much of the information is still preliminary at this stage. In addition, auction clearance rates remain well down on a year ago, suggesting that vendors' price expectations are not being met. ", " Following the two increases in the cash rate at the end of 2003, the Board considered at its subsequent monthly meetings whether there was a case to increase rates further. One consideration was that, with the cash rate having been increased by a total of 100 basis points since mid 2002, the amount of monetary stimulus to the economy was now significantly reduced. A further consideration was the unfolding adjustment in housing finance and house prices. As has been discussed in previous <em>Statements</em>, the medium-term risk associated with overheating in this part of the economy had been taken into account in the decisions to raise the cash rate late last year. While this factor was not the principal driver of policy, it had been an important reason to avoid unnecessary delay in moving the cash rate back up to a more normal position. The adjustment now underway in housing finance reduces this source of risk to the economy, but it is still too early to predict how it will unfold. ", " It is advantageous that this adjustment is occurring at a time when the broader macroeconomic situation is favourable. The Australian economy is growing solidly and inflation for the present is relatively low, though likely to rise next year. The international recovery has gained strength, which will be helpful to Australia's exporters, and the risks to the export sector from the rapidly rising exchange rate have lessened. ", " Overall then, while the risks to the economy have not gone away entirely, developments over recent months suggest that the chances of achieving well-balanced growth and a more restrained pace of credit expansion have improved. In these circumstances the Board decided at its recent monthly meetings to hold the cash rate unchanged. In its deliberations on monetary policy, the Board will continue to monitor all these developments and make adjustments as required, with a view to achieving sustainable growth in the medium term with low inflation. ", " The recovery in the world economy has continued at a brisk pace into the early part of 2004, particularly in the US and east Asia. In its latest assessment of the international outlook, released in late April, the IMF forecasts that growth in the G7 countries will pick up from 2.2 per cent in 2003 to 3.5 per cent in 2004, which is well above the trend rate of around 2½ per cent (Table 1). Conditions in emerging economies are even stronger than for industrialised countries (Graph 1). World GDP growth is therefore expected to accelerate from <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.9 per cent</span> in 2003 to 4.6 per cent in 2004, which would be among the fastest rates of growth experienced in the past 30 years. On IMF projections growth will moderate slightly in 2005, but is expected to be a little more evenly spread across regions. ", " The US economy continues to grow strongly, spurred by accommodative fiscal and monetary policy settings, together with the depreciation of the US dollar over the past year or so. After rising very strongly in the second half of last year, GDP grew by 1.0 per cent in the March quarter, to be 4.9 per cent higher than a year earlier <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 2)</span>. There are now also clear signs of improvement in the labour market. ", " The labour market had been viewed as the main cloud over the US economy, with some surprisingly soft outcomes for non-farm payrolls employment in late 2003 and early 2004. However, payrolls data for March showed an increase of 308,000 jobs, with upward revisions to earlier months resulting in an average increase over the previous couple of months of around 100,000 jobs (Graph 3). This suggests that the recovery occurring in the rest of the economy is now beginning to flow through to the labour market. Most other labour market indicators are also pointing to further solid increases in employment. For example, weekly initial jobless claims are currently running at around the 345,000 level, which in the past has been consistent with monthly employment gains of around 150,000; the manufacturing ISM employment index is at a 20-year high; and growth in temporary-help services employment (which tends to lead overall employment) has picked up. Much of the weakness in payroll employment has been in the manufacturing sector, but this sector has strengthened recently. ", " Despite the generally lacklustre state of the labour market until quite recently, household consumption was again an important source of growth in the March quarter, rising by 0.9 per cent in the quarter and by 4.3 per cent over the year. Household spending has been supported by low interest rates, rising household wealth and recent tax cuts. Household wealth rose by 5.1 per cent in the December quarter, reflecting rising house and share prices, to be 11.7 per cent higher over the year. ", " In the business sector, conditions are very favourable and are driving an upswing in investment (Graph 4). Business investment rose by a further 1.7 per cent in the March quarter, following strong growth in the second half of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2003</span>, to be 9.4 per cent higher than a year earlier. Equipment investment again led the way, particularly the information technology component. Looking forward, conditions seem supportive of continued strong investment growth. Corporate profits surged 7.2 per cent in the December quarter and by 29 per cent over the year, pushing the profit share of GDP to a level well above its long-run average. Business confidence is high, and balance sheets appear to be sound, with corporate gearing at a low level by historical standards. It also seems likely that inventory rebuilding will add to growth over 2004. Some rebuilding of inventories has already occurred over the past six months, but the inventories-to-sales ratio remains at a low level. ", " Strong productivity growth, combined with moderating wage growth and ample spare capacity in the economy, led to unit labour costs falling by 1.7 per cent over the year to the December quarter. However, more recent data show some modest pick-up in inflation. Core CPI inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, picked up to 1.6 per cent over the year to March from a low of 1.1 per cent in late 2003. ", " The economic situation in Japan is more promising than it has been for some time, and the economy now looks to be in a fairly healthy expansion phase. Real GDP increased by 1.6 per cent in the December quarter to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.6 per cent</span> higher over the year (Graph 5). Much of the strength reflects ongoing growth in business investment and exports, which have been keying off strong corporate profitability and robust external demand, particularly from China. It is possible that measured GDP growth is somewhat overstated due to difficulties in estimating the GDP deflator, which is falling considerably more quickly than other price measures; nominal GDP has grown by a much more modest 0.8 per cent over the year, although this is still an improvement on recent history. ", " Notwithstanding the problems in estimating real GDP, other more timely data also point to a solid recovery in Japan. Both the Tankan survey and the Shoko Chukin survey of small business suggest conditions in the manufacturing sector are as strong as at any time in the past 15 years or so. After climbing sharply in late 2003, industrial production and merchandise exports have levelled out in early 2004, although both measures remain well up on levels recorded a year earlier. Moreover, firms are increasingly reporting that the upswing is broadening to the services sector where conditions had previously been more subdued. ", " Conditions in the household sector are also looking a little brighter, with signs of improvement in the labour market and rosier consumer sentiment supporting a revival in consumer spending. The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 5½ per cent in early 2003 to below 5 per cent currently – the first notable reduction in unemployment since the 1980s (Graph 6). Employment has risen over the past year and forward-looking indicators, such as the ratio of job offers to applicants, point to further gains in the near term. Trends in other indicators such as retail sales and household spending have also been somewhat more positive in the early part of 2004. ", " Consistent with the upturn in output growth, deflationary pressures continue to moderate, although this partly reflects some temporary factors such as a poor harvest boosting rice prices sharply. Consumer prices fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.1 per cent</span> over the year to March, compared with deflation rates of nearly 1 per cent in the past few years. Domestic corporate goods prices, a measure of wholesale and producer prices, have also stabilised in recent months largely due to the run-up in global commodity prices. Land prices continue to decline, falling by <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent in 2003;</span> this brings the total decline since 1991 to 48 per cent. Even so, there have been some signs of land prices levelling out in major urban areas such as central Tokyo. ", " Prospects for Japanese banks are also looking more positive recently. The demand for loans seems to be picking up, especially amongst smaller businesses, and banks have made further progress in writing off non-performing loans. According to official data, non-performing loans currently account for around 7½ per cent of bank lending, down from their peak of around 9½ per cent in early 2002. ", " Supported by expansionary macroeconomic policy settings, stimulatory financial conditions and the recovery in the global economy, east Asia has bounced back strongly after the SARS-related weakness of the first half of 2003 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 2)</span>. While exports are growing very rapidly there has also been a healthy revival in domestic demand, back to the rapid rates typically seen prior to the financial crises of 1997–98. With many of these economies linking their exchange rates to the US dollar, growth has been boosted by the depreciation of the dollar and by low interest rates. ", " In China, growth in activity appears to have maintained the extremely rapid pace seen last year, with GDP expanding by 9.7 per cent over the year to the March quarter. The Chinese authorities have expressed concern about overheating in some sectors of the economy, taking action to rein in credit growth and rebalance growth away from investment and towards greater household spending, but as yet there is little evidence that this is having the desired effect. Export growth has eased a little, following the surge in December 2003 as exporters sought to avoid the cut in tax rebates on 1 January, but growth over the year remains exceptionally strong at <span class=\"no-wrap\">43 per cent</span>. Imports have also continued to grow strongly and as a result the trade balance was in deficit in the March quarter for the first time in eight years (Graph 7). Moreover, year-ended growth in industrial production picked up from 18.1 per cent in December to 19.4 per cent in March, and household consumption shows no signs of slowing. ", " The Indian economy has also continued to perform strongly, with year-ended GDP growth of 10.4 per cent recorded in the December quarter (see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>’ for a further discussion on India). This is the strongest reading since quarterly data were first compiled in mid 1996, and is partly the result of sharply higher agricultural production owing to a favourable monsoon. The manufacturing and services sectors also grew strongly, with more recent data showing continued strength in the March quarter. Industrial production is estimated to have risen by around 2 per cent over the three months to February to be 7½ per cent higher than a year earlier, while exports have also continued to rise sharply in recent months to be around 30 per cent higher in year-ended terms. ", " Elsewhere in the region, the strong growth experienced since mid 2003 has continued into 2004. Industrial production and merchandise exports are still expanding rapidly, fuelled by depreciations in real exchange rates, a resurgent world economy and ongoing strength in China, which has boosted intra-Asian trade (Graph 8). Growth in retail sales and investment has also picked up, spurred by stronger stock markets, falling unemployment and more buoyant sentiment. For the moment, consumer price inflation remains contained across the region. However, increased inflation pressures evident in upstream measures are starting to show up at the consumer level in some countries, including Singapore and China. ", " In Korea, soaring exports have been the main driver of growth in the economy. Domestic demand has been held back by weak consumption, which fell by 2.6 per cent over the year to the December quarter in response to restrictive measures introduced in 2002, aimed at slowing the previously very strong rates of growth in consumer credit. Household spending is expected to start to recover soon, now that the strong export-led growth is flowing through to the labour market. The government has also implemented a number of measures to help speed the recovery, such as lowering the sales tax on various luxury goods and frontloading some of its own spending. ", " The New Zealand economy is growing solidly, propelled by strong growth in domestic demand. GDP expanded by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, after rising by 1.6 per cent in the September quarter, to be 3.2 per cent higher over the year. Domestic demand was up by 6.8 per cent over the year, with household consumption, residential investment and business investment all growing rapidly. However, net exports subtracted <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 percentage</span> points from GDP growth over the same period. The latest retail sales figures and consumer confidence surveys suggest that growth in consumer spending remained firm in the March quarter. Reflecting buoyant domestic demand, non-tradable inflation stood at 5.0 per cent over the year to the March quarter. This was offset by falling import prices resulting from the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar, so total CPI inflation remained low at 1.5 per cent over this period. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand increased the overnight cash rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 per cent in late April, in response to domestic inflation pressures and the strengthening global economy. ", " In contrast to the other major economic regions, the euro area is experiencing only the mildest of recoveries. Domestic demand remains weak and the appreciation of the euro appears to be dampening export growth. In the December quarter, GDP expanded by 0.3 per cent to be 0.6 per cent higher over the year (Table 3). Encouragingly, investment rose in the quarter at its fastest rate in three years. However consumption remains weak, being flat in the quarter and rising by 0.6 per cent over the year. ", " Although business surveys continue to point to a gradual recovery in activity in the euro area, recent trends in the production and spending data have been less encouraging (Graph 9). After improving throughout the second <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of last year</span>, business confidence has remained broadly steady in recent months, at levels roughly consistent with trend output growth. However, euro area industrial production has shown few signs of recovery, and has fallen slightly over the past three months. Retail sales data also suggest that consumption remains sluggish, held back by subdued consumer sentiment. ", " The labour market is showing signs of stabilisation, with the unemployment rate holding steady for the past year at 8.8 per cent. Weak economic conditions in the past couple of years have seen growth in labour costs slow to 2½ per cent over the year to the December quarter, from 3½ per cent a year earlier. Inflation outcomes have been broadly in line with the ECB's target of inflation close to, but less than, 2 per cent. Consumer price inflation has slowed a little, from 2.2 per cent in late 2003 to 2.0 per cent over the year to April, and measures of underlying inflation are generally also around 2 per cent. The ECB has held its policy rate steady at 2 per cent since June 2003. ", " In the United Kingdom, the economy remains buoyant, spurred by a strong labour market and continued rapid growth in house prices (Graphs 10 and 11). UK GDP rose by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter, to be 3.0 per cent higher than a year earlier. The household sector remains the key driver of growth, with retail sales having risen by 6.4 per cent over the year to March. Unemployment is at its lowest rate since the mid 1970s and the housing market has shown renewed strength in recent months, with year-ended growth in national house prices back above 15 per cent. However, conditions in the business sector are more subdued. Although there has been a noticeable lift in business confidence over the past six months or so, manufacturing production has shown no growth over the past year. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.3 per cent in February to 1.1 per cent in March. The Bank of England left policy rates unchanged in April after the increase in February. ", " The West Texas Intermediate crude oil price has tended to increase over recent months, to be around <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$38 per barrel</span>, compared with around US$32 in late 2003 (Graph 12). The rise reflects strong global demand for oil, particularly from the US and China, consistent with the pick-up in demand for commodities more generally. Although there has been some rebuilding of crude oil stocks recently, gasoline stocks in the US remain quite low. This has prompted some concern over the adequacy of current supplies in the US and resulted in upward pressure on prices. Developments on the supply side have also contributed to the strength in oil prices over recent months. Political demonstrations in Venezuela, a major oil producer, have led to fears of possible supply disruptions, while OPEC reduced official output quotas by 1 million barrels per day from the beginning of April. ", " Part of the marked increase in US dollar oil prices over the past year has simply reflected the depreciation of the US dollar. Although the rise in oil prices in SDR terms has been significant, it has been less pronounced. Similarly, oil prices in Australian dollar terms are currently well below the peaks seen in 2000 and 2003. ", " With the global economic recovery consolidating over the past three months, the main focus of markets has been on the likely timing of the first increase in the US federal funds rate from its 45-year low of 1 per cent. These expectations have been driven largely by fluctuations in US labour market data. Weaker-than-expected non-farm payrolls releases for January and February saw expectations of monetary tightening pushed out to the end of 2004. This was subsequently reversed in early April, on the release of a strong non-farm payrolls outcome for March. The federal funds futures market currently expects the FOMC to increase rates by 25 basis points by August at the latest (Graph 13). ", " The pace of tightening currently priced in by the market is very moderate compared with the experience in past tightening cycles. The market expects a tightening of 75 basis points by year end, and the yield curve indicates that the implied cash rate in a couple of years' time will still be under 4 per cent. That would be a relatively low level by historical standards; in the past two tightening cycles by the Fed, the federal funds rate peaked at around 6 per cent. ", " In Europe and Japan, markets do not expect the monetary authorities to tighten in the foreseeable future; in fact in Europe there is still talk of an interest rate cut as the economic recovery has continued to lag the rest of the world. In Japan, while the economic recovery is broadening, the Bank of Japan has indicated that it will maintain highly stimulative policy until inflation becomes consistently positive. ", " The direction of monetary policy in other developed economies has continued to diverge (Graph 14, Table 4). The Bank of Canada has cut its policy rate by a cumulative 75 basis points so far this year (in three moves) to <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, against a background of weak GDP growth and subdued inflation. Similarly, the Swedish Riksbank has cut its policy rate by a total of 75 basis points (in two steps) to 2 per cent, in the face of a larger-than-expected fall in inflation. In contrast, the Bank of England increased its repo rate by 25 basis points in February to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span>, following a similar move in November, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has increased its policy rate by 50 basis points so far this year (in two steps) to 5.5 per cent. The range of policy interest rates among industrial countries remains unusually wide. ", " Despite very strong economic growth over recent quarters, most Asian central banks have maintained highly accommodative monetary policy settings over the past three months. Indonesia reduced its official rate by a <span class=\"no-wrap\">total of 75 basis points</span> to 7 per cent in response to further declines in inflation. The People's Bank of China, however, announced a further increase in reserve requirements for banks in an effort to ameliorate overheating in some sectors. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also signalled a tightening of monetary conditions when it announced in April that it will allow a ‘modest and gradual’ appreciation of the Singapore dollar. The MAS cited a more favourable growth outlook and the risk of rising inflationary pressures as reasons for the change. ", " Amongst other emerging market economies, the only significant policy moves were in Brazil, where rates were cut by a further 50 basis points to 16 per cent, and Turkey, which cut rates by a total of 4 percentage points, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">22 per cent</span>. ", " Over the past three months, yields on both US and European government bonds have been driven largely by expectations about the timing of the prospective start of the normalisation of US monetary policy (Graph 15). Yields in both regions fell sharply following the release of disappointing US employment data early in the year, reaching their lowest levels since mid 2003. However, as expectations of the next tightening in the US were moved forward following the March payrolls release in early April, yields rose sharply. In the case of the US, yields rose by 90 basis points from their March low point, to reach 4.6 per cent – at the upper end of their range over the past year. German yields rose 30 basis points to around 4.2 per cent, a little lower than three months earlier. ", " The continuing flow of solid economic data in Japan, and more upbeat assessments of the economy by Japanese officials, strengthened hopes that the current upturn will be sustained. This saw yields on <span class=\"no-wrap\">Japanese government</span> debt rise steadily in March and April to around 1.5 per cent, 30 basis points above their mid-February low. Consistent with the better economic outlook for Japan, Moody's upgraded Japan's long-term foreign currency debt rating in early April and S&amp;P upgraded the outlook on Japan's domestic currency sovereign credit rating in late March. ", " The increasingly positive outlook for the global economy and the associated reduction in risk aversion have continued to help corporate and emerging market sovereign debt. US corporate spreads narrowed modestly over the three months since the last <em>Statement</em>, from levels already well below historical averages (Graph 16). ", " The fall in spreads has been accompanied by a sharp reduction in differentiation between high and low rated credit risks (Graph 17). Spreads on the lowest quality segment of the ‘junk’ bond category, ‘C’ rated bonds, have narrowed by an extraordinary 30 percentage points since late 2001, to around 5.5 percentage points. These bonds have a very high default rate (historically greater than 25 per cent). This indicates that investors are becoming much less discerning in their investments as they seek out yield. ", " Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt rose modestly over the past three months, to an average of around 310 basis points over US Treasuries (Graph 18). However, they remain close to the low level prevailing before the Asian crisis, reflecting the generally benign environment for most emerging markets as well as investor appetite for higher yields than currently prevail in industrial countries. ", " After rallying strongly in the 12 months to February, the major US and European equity indices traded broadly sideways over the past three months as investors focused on the likelihood that US interest rates will rise sometime this year (Graph 19, Table 5). ", " In the US, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 1 per cent since the beginning of February, although it remains 40 per cent above its March 2003 trough. The rally stalled despite the rapid rebound in corporate profitability (Graph 20), perhaps reflecting some concern in markets about the likelihood of a monetary tightening in the US. The strong rise in company profits, coupled with changes to corporate taxation and depreciation rates, has seen the profit share of GDP (after tax and depreciation) touch historical highs (Graph 21). As a result, the S&amp;P 500's price/earnings ratio has fallen to its lowest level since 1997 – although it remains well above its long-term <span class=\"no-wrap\">average (Graph 22)</span>. ", " The major European equity markets have continued to take their lead from the US, despite the more subdued nature of the economic recovery in the euro zone. The Euro STOXX is up only marginally over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">three months</span>, but remains 52 per cent above its March 2003 low. ", " While the rally in the major US and European indices stalled over the past three months, Japanese share prices continued to surge, reflecting increasing confidence that the economic recovery is self-sustaining. The Topix index has increased 13 per cent since the beginning of February and is now 54 per cent above its March 2003 low point. The rally has been led by the banking sector, which has risen by 34 per cent since February. Reflecting the sector's improved prospects, Moody's upgraded the ratings outlook for four Japanese banks in mid March. ", " Other Asian equity markets have on average fallen modestly in recent months, led by falls in the Hong Kong market, where currency board arrangements mean that interest rates are expected to rise as the US Fed starts to tighten. Latin American equity markets have also been relatively subdued. ", " After falling for the previous two years, the exchange rate of the US dollar in trade-weighted terms appreciated modestly over the past three months. The broad trade-weighted index (TWI) has risen by around 2 per cent, while the major currencies TWI is up by around 4 per cent (Graph 23). Greater confidence in the US economic recovery and the belief that interest rates in the US may begin to rise sooner than had been thought a couple of months ago have helped to lift the US dollar. ", " After reaching a record high against the US dollar of US$1.293 in mid February, the euro depreciated over subsequent months and is now about 6 per cent below its mid-February peak (Graph 24). On a trade-weighted basis, the euro has fallen by about 3 per cent since mid February. ", " The yen has been volatile over the past three months, in net terms falling by 3 per cent against the US dollar. Heavy official intervention initially pushed the yen down in February and March; intervention in the March quarter was US$140 billion, a record quarterly amount and followed intervention of US$175 billion in 2003. From mid March, as intervention was wound back, the yen rose for a time but it could not sustain the upward momentum in April in the face of the broad-based rise of the US dollar following the stronger-than-expected US economic data. ", " Currencies of other Asian and Latin American countries were, on average, broadly flat against the US dollar. In the case of Asian currencies, this in part reflected ongoing foreign exchange intervention. Official reserves of Asian countries (excluding Japan) rose by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$50 billion</span> over February and March. ", " After peaking at US80 cents in mid February, the Australian dollar fell through the second half of February and <span class=\"no-wrap\">early March</span>. Following a temporary recovery to US77 cents in mid April it fell again, reaching a low of US71.24 cents. The decline has been the first major fall since mid 2003, with the Australian dollar currently about <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> below its peak (Graph 25). ", " Some of the fall in the Australian dollar over recent months has been a reflection of the strengthening US dollar. Other factors have also been at work, however, as the Australian dollar has fallen against all currencies in the TWI except the New Zealand dollar – i.e. the fall has been very broadly based (Table 6). ", " Recent weakness in the Australian dollar may have reflected the fact that the market had become over-extended as the exchange rate had risen for six months in a row, with a cumulative rise of 25 per cent. Such a prolonged and large movement, without some correction, is very unusual. An indication of the buying pressure from foreign investors in the Australian dollar market over late 2003/early 2004 can be seen in Graph 26 which shows positions in the Australian dollar futures contract on the Chicago Futures Exchange. Long positions had built up to record levels by early 2004. These have since largely been unwound, indicating that the market has become more balanced recently. ", " A pattern that has emerged over the past couple of years has been for the Australian dollar to move more overnight in offshore trading sessions than in domestic sessions (Graph 27). There may be two reasons for this. First, the moves in the exchange rate to a large degree have been a reflection of moves in the US dollar on world markets, which in turn reflected news about the US released during the US time zone. Second, foreign investors have been very important participants in the Australian dollar market and a lot of their trading has taken place during their day in Europe and the US. Around 95 per cent of the appreciation in the currency from its lows in April 2001 has occurred in overnight trading. Weakness in the Australian dollar observed in recent months has notably also occurred in the overnight trading session, again reflecting the importance of offshore players. ", " There is evidence to suggest that export companies have increased their hedging in early 2004 after scaling it back in 2003. Mining companies in particular appear to have increased their hedging significantly, with the proportion of their net currency exposure hedged increasing to 35 per cent over the March quarter, from <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 per cent</span> late last year. The average term of hedges is about 20 months. ", " With the exchange rate somewhat weaker in recent months, the Bank curtailed its replenishment of foreign exchange reserves. Over the past three months its net purchases of foreign exchange amounted to $1.8 billion, most of which occurred prior to the peak in the Australian dollar in mid February. In the previous three months the Bank had been more active, accruing $5.8 billion in reserves. As at the end of April, net reserve assets were <span class=\"no-wrap\">$23 billion</span>. The Bank also held a further $25.6 billion under foreign exchange swaps, a slight increase over the past three months as swaps have continued to be used for domestic liquidity management. ", " The Australian economy grew rapidly over the second half of 2003, with output expanding at an annualised rate of 5½ per cent. While growth should moderate from this rapid pace in 2004, early indications are that it will still be relatively strong. In the December quarter, GDP increased by 1.4 per cent, to be 4.0 per cent higher over the year (Graph 28). There was a continuation of the rapid expansion in domestic spending that has been underway since late 2001, with domestic final demand rising by 2¼ per cent in the quarter, almost double the average pace of the previous 10 years. The strength in domestic demand was broadly based, but the rise in consumer spending was particularly notable and resulted in the highest year-ended rate of growth in consumption in nearly five years. In addition, a further sharp rise in farm output contributed 0.4 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth. ", " Despite a pick-up in exports, net trade remained a substantial drag on GDP growth in the December quarter owing to rapid growth in import demand, driven by strong domestic demand and the appreciation of the exchange rate. Recent trade figures point to continued solid growth in exports in early 2004, in line with the improving international environment and much-improved rural conditions. ", " The growth of household spending was very rapid in late 2003. Growth appears to have continued into 2004, albeit at a more moderate pace. National accounts data show that growth in real household consumption in the second half of 2003 was 7 per cent on an annualised basis, the strongest pace in over 20 years. Growth has been supported by further strong rises in wealth, particularly from the gains in property prices over recent years. There was also a noticeable acceleration in disposable income in the second half of 2003, following a year of relatively weak growth (Graph 29). This was underpinned by an improvement in farm income and a pick-up in income from dividends and interest. The strength of employment and real wages has also played a role in boosting household incomes and this is expected to continue through 2004. ", " More recent data on retail sales, which account for more than one-third of household consumption, point to slower growth in consumption in the March quarter. The value of retail sales rose only modestly in the first two months of the year, following exceptionally fast growth at the end of 2003. Concurrently, however, growth of prices appears to have been quite subdued, suggesting some growth in real terms. Available data point to strong growth in other components of household consumption. Sales of motor vehicles rose strongly in the March quarter to be 9 per cent higher over the year; this growth follows a record level of sales in 2003 (Graph 30). Buoyant demand in this market stems from the high level of vehicle affordability – in part a consequence of the appreciation of the Australian dollar – and generally favourable financial conditions. More broadly, consumer sentiment remains at a high level, especially with regard to employment prospects. ", " Although the growth rate of household income picked up in the second half of 2003, it was still lower than that of consumption (Graph 29). This has resulted in a further fall in the saving ratio, which appears to have been related to the substantial rise in the value of household assets over the past year. Asset values have been boosted by growth in house prices, and to a lesser extent by the recent improvement in equity markets. At the same time, households have continued to accumulate debt at a rapid pace, with credit extended to households increasing by 22 per cent over the year to March. The ongoing growth in debt has seen a steady increase in interest payments as a proportion of disposable income, and at the end of 2003 this measure of the debt-servicing burden exceeded its previous peak in the late 1980s (Graph 31). However, in contrast to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">late 1980s</span>, consumer sentiment remains at a high level. In addition, indicators of financial stress – such as loan arrears – remain low, suggesting that the high debt-servicing burden is not yet imposing a significant constraint on consumer spending. ", " Dwelling investment grew strongly over the second half of 2003, with a 3.3 per cent increase in the December quarter, taking the share of dwelling investment in GDP close to record levels. Growth at the end of 2003 was concentrated in new dwelling construction, with renovation activity making only a modest contribution to growth. ", " Private residential building approvals – a leading indicator of activity – have trended down over recent months, so that in March the number of approvals was 17 per cent below the peak observed in September 2003. This decline reflects weakness in both house and medium-density approvals (Graph 32). Looking ahead, further falls in approvals seem likely. The Housing Industry Association reports that commitments to build houses are now around 35 per cent below their recent peak, and that new multi-unit sales continue to trend down. Nevertheless, commencements and work yet to be done were still at high levels in the December quarter, with builders of houses reporting large backlogs of work and many apartments remaining committed for construction. Activity is thus likely to have held up at a relatively high level in the early part of 2004, but is expected to decline thereafter. Even so, a number of factors suggest that the decline will be mild in comparison with previous housing cycles. In particular, strong underlying demand for housing and generally positive macroeconomic conditions are likely to sustain new dwelling construction. Also, declines in new dwelling construction are likely to be partially offset by relative strength in renovation activity. ", " The value of housing loan approvals peaked at around $15 billion a month in October 2003 and has now fallen in each of the four months to February, to an amount currently around $12 billion a month. As was explained in <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2004/feb/1.html#box-c\">Box C</a>’</span> in the February 2004 <em>Statement</em>, the level of loan approvals is a leading indicator of the growth rate of credit, though the relationship from month to month is not very precise. There are some tentative signs that the decline in loan approvals is starting to reduce credit growth, with the rate of growth of housing credit having eased modestly on a three-month-ended basis in recent months but not on the widely used twelve-month-ended basis (Graph 33). However, both loan approvals and credit growth still remain at high levels, and the value of loan approvals would need to fall significantly further to bring credit growth back to a reasonably sustainable pace. ", " Consistent with the easing in finance approvals, there have been a number of signs of a cooling in the housing market since the end of last year. After the rapid increases recorded during 2003, available data for the early <span class=\"no-wrap\">part of 2004</span> show that house prices have fallen, though the data are volatile and need to be interpreted with caution. The three widely used measures of house prices in Australia are those provided by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Of these, only the CBA measure is available Australia-wide for the <span class=\"no-wrap\">March quarter 2004</span>, and it shows falls in prices for all capital cities (Table 7). The fall in the March quarter follows a surprisingly strong rise in the December quarter, and these movements may partly reflect seasonal changes in the composition of transactions in this period. The housing price data from the REIA are released on a state-by-state basis, and so far only the figures for Melbourne are available for the March quarter. They show a fall in <span class=\"no-wrap\">house prices of 0.8 per cent</span> and in apartment prices of 2.1 per cent. ", " These widely used measures of house prices are all less than fully satisfactory in that the quarterly movements are influenced by compositional changes and contain significant lags in recording transactions; the lags arise because most standard indices record prices as at the date a transaction is settled, which is well after the price was determined by agreement on a contract. In analysing property market developments, the RBA has attempted to overcome these problems by using more specialised indices constructed by property research firms. The series from Australian Property Monitors (APM) deals with the problem of lags by recording prices as at the date of contract. This means that the March quarter data include only transactions that were contracted in the March quarter and have already been settled. Like the other indices cited above, this series shows price falls for all capital cities excluding Adelaide (Table 7). The series shown are the first estimates for the March quarter, which are based on a sample that is a little over a third of the likely total. This will be subject to progressive revision as the full set of transactions becomes available. ", " A further series from Residex, which has been reported in previous issues of this <em>Statement</em>, deals with the problem of compositional change by using a repeat sales index. It is available for the three largest cities, and in the March quarter shows small falls in Sydney and Brisbane and a flat outcome for Melbourne. These figures are also subject to revision in light of subsequent data. Overall, while no single indicator can be regarded as definitive, the preponderance of price falls in the major cities suggests that for Australia overall, house prices declined in the March quarter. ", " The above discussion focused on house prices, but the equivalent data are also available for apartments (Table 8). These show significant falls in Sydney and Melbourne for all three indices, but rises in other capital cities (with the exception of Perth, which appears to be an aberration). For Australia overall, the declines in Sydney and Melbourne outweigh the rises elsewhere, implying a substantial fall in prices nation-wide. ", " A further sign of slowing demand in the housing market since late 2003 is evident in the fall in auction clearance rates across the capital cities. This is especially apparent in Sydney and Melbourne, where clearance rates since November have been well below levels recorded in corresponding periods of previous years. In recent weeks, clearance rates have declined further in Sydney while remaining in the 50–60 per cent range in Melbourne <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 34)</span>. Survey indicators also imply that buyer sentiment has fallen recently. According to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumers, sentiment towards buying a dwelling remained relatively weak in March, though it ticked up slightly from a low in December. The proportion of survey respondents nominating real estate as the wisest place for savings also remains relatively low. ", " Differences between housing markets across the capital cities are apparent from data on rental markets. Rents continue to grow solidly in Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra, though they remain generally subdued in other capitals. In Sydney and Melbourne, rental growth is being constrained by high vacancy rates relative to levels of the past. Vacancies for apartments in inner Melbourne and Sydney have stabilised at a relatively high level, and vacancy rates for newly completed apartments have increased sharply in recent months. Reflecting this, apartment rents in inner-city areas have been roughly flat in Sydney over the past year and are well down on earlier peaks in Melbourne (Graph 35). ", " Looking ahead, there are a number of recent developments that could have significant effects on the housing market. One is the announcement by the Australian Tax Office regarding the tightening of depreciation allowances for investment properties. Another is the package of changes to property taxes in New South Wales announced in April. The removal of stamp duty for first-home buyers may provide some boost to this segment of the market. However, the vendor transfer duty on investor property sales and other changes in land tax arrangements are expected to dampen investor demand. In Victoria, reductions in land taxes have been announced for businesses and investors, while first-home buyers will receive a one-off additional grant for purchases before the end of June 2005. All of these changes come at a time of waning sentiment in the investor market, and some recent reports by developers of investors failing to settle on off-the-plan apartments. In light of problems in this segment of the market, greater attention is being paid to some of the legal aspects underlying off-the-plan transactions. ", " Business conditions appear to have eased in early 2004 from the high levels reported at the end of 2003, although they remain consistent with firm growth in non-farm GDP. In particular, indicators of business confidence remain above long-run levels, overall profitability remains strong, and business investment is expected to continue to grow, albeit more slowly than in the past two years. ", " After a few years of divergent outcomes, robust growth was recorded in both the goods and services sectors of the economy in the second half of 2003 (Graph 36). Farm output also increased rapidly, with the sector recovering from the effects of drought. In the non-farm economy, output growth has generally been strongest in those industries with relatively more exposure to domestic demand, including construction and wholesale and retail trade, as well as various business service industries (Graph 37). Output of tourism-related services has also been strong. In contrast, growth has been much weaker in some other sectors with significant exposure to international markets, especially in manufacturing, where production has been flat over the year owing in part to the effect of the appreciation of the currency. In addition, output in the mining sector has been held back by recent temporary disruptions to production. ", " More recent indicators, such as the NAB survey of the non-farm sector for the March quarter, point to a moderate easing in business conditions from the high level in late 2003 (Graph 38). The easing has occurred across most sectors, but was more pronounced for property &amp; business services and the export-oriented areas of mining and agribusiness. However, conditions remain above long-run average levels for all sectors, and are especially favourable for firms with greater exposure to domestic demand. ", " Looking ahead, various surveys show that business confidence and most indicators of expected activity are around or above long-run average levels. This is evident in the NAB survey, the Sensis survey of small and medium-sized firms, and the ACCI-Westpac and AIG March quarter surveys of manufacturing (Graph 39). The latter survey also suggests that manufactured exports have picked up following a fall in the December quarter. ", " Corporate profits increased solidly over 2003, rising by 12 per cent. Much of the strength has been in domestically focused industries such as transport &amp; storage, and property &amp; business services. The profitability of unincorporated non-farm businesses also remains strong. Profits of the farm sector as a whole continued to recover from the effects of drought, while mining profits were flat in the December quarter 2003, following falls in the previous three quarters. Looking forward, business surveys suggest profitability overall is expected to remain higher than average, though there has been some easing in the survey responses from the highs in late 2003. ", " The continued strength in corporate profits has provided ample internal funds for business investment. In addition, fund raising from external sources in 2003 was stronger than it had been in the previous two years, largely owing to solid growth in lending by financial intermediaries. In the first few months of 2004, however, external fund raising appears to have moderated, with business credit contracting slightly after rising rapidly in late 2003. Also, equity raisings eased from their strong pace in late 2003, though the outlook is positive, with several large initial public offerings expected to take place over the next few months. Corporate gearing ratios remain conservative by historical standards and debt servicing costs remain low, reflecting the relatively low level of interest rates. ", " Business investment has picked up considerably over the past two years, rising by over 30 per cent. Growth was robust over the second half of 2003, with investment rising by more than 4 per cent in the December quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 40)</span>. The growth in the December quarter was driven primarily by a 10 per cent surge in non-residential construction activity, with sharp rises in work done in both the engineering and non-residential building components. Growth in machinery and equipment investment remained robust, increasing by 2 per cent in the quarter. Conditions remain generally supportive of further strong growth in investment, notwithstanding some recent concerns over the relatively high level of the exchange rate among firms subject to external pressures. In particular, despite falling from the peak reached in the December quarter, capacity utilisation is still at a high level and financial conditions remain favourable. ", " Surveys of investment intentions point to continued growth in business investment in real terms, albeit at lower rates than the robust growth seen through 2003. The Capex survey shows investment intentions for 2004/05 that are consistent with reasonably solid growth in machinery and equipment investment, especially in the mining and transport &amp; storage sectors. In addition, the Rabobank survey suggests that investment in the farm sector – which is not included in the Capex survey – is likely to remain strong over the year ahead, at close to pre-drought levels. ", " Forward-looking indicators of investment in buildings and structures also suggest continuing strength in investment. Engineering construction activity has nearly doubled over the past two years and this upswing is likely to be sustained in the period ahead, with a number of significant road and mining-related projects scheduled for commencement in 2004 (Graph 41). The outlook for non-residential building activity is more mixed, with high levels of work in the pipeline likely to sustain activity for several quarters, but with falls in the value of building approvals suggesting some easing in the medium term. This is consistent with the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em>, which indicates a decline in the value of non-residential building projects coming on stream in the period ahead. ", " The strong labour market conditions of 2003 have continued into early 2004 (Graph 42). Employment has grown at an average annualised rate of 3.4 per cent over the past six months, compared with an average of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span> over the past decade. In the three months to March 2004, most of the gains were in full-time employment. This is consistent with the pattern of growth seen over the course of last year and confirms the underlying strength of the labour market. ", " In line with solid employment growth, the unemployment rate has continued to edge lower in recent months, reaching 5.6 per cent in March 2004 (Graph 43). This is roughly equivalent to previous cyclical lows in 1981 and 1989. The participation rate increased to 63.7 per cent in March 2004, a relatively high level in comparison with the average of the past decade. ", " The recent gains in employment have been broadly based across states (Table 9). With the exception of <span class=\"no-wrap\">South Australia</span>, all states recorded substantial employment growth, with notable strength in Queensland, <span class=\"no-wrap\">New South Wales and Tasmania</span>. As a result, unemployment rates have fallen in most states. ", " Recent employment growth has been concentrated in industries that mainly service the household sector, such as health &amp; community services, retail trade, and cultural &amp; recreational services (Table 10). Employment in the finance and insurance sector also made a solid contribution to growth, as did mining employment, which has risen by around one-third since early 2001. Job shedding in recent quarters has been most pronounced in manufacturing, where businesses with relatively more exposure to trade are being adversely affected by the appreciation of the Australian dollar. Agricultural employment has been fairly stable in recent quarters, after having increased early last year. Even so, it remains well down on levels that prevailed before the drought. ", " Forward-looking indicators suggest that employment will continue to grow strongly, albeit at a more moderate pace than of late. Print-based measures of vacancies published by ANZ and the DEWR posted strong gains over the three months to April, as did the ANZ measure of internet-based vacancies. The NAB and ACCI-Westpac surveys also suggest a positive near-term employment outlook, with hiring intentions well above long-run average levels (Graph 44). ", " A modest improvement in Australia's trade performance has been evident since mid 2003. This follows a period in which exports had been constrained by the combined effects of weak global demand and drought, while imports were buoyed by rapid growth in domestic demand. These developments led to a substantial widening in the deficit on trade in goods and services, to as much as 3½ per cent of GDP in the June quarter 2003 (Graph 45). While strong domestic demand continues to support import growth, global demand has turned decisively in recent months and drought conditions have subsided, prompting some recovery in export volumes. The upswing in global demand has also boosted commodity prices, contributing to a sharp rise in the terms of trade to a 27-year high. This has resulted in a narrowing in the trade deficit since mid 2003 to around 3 per cent of GDP in the March quarter. Accordingly, the current account deficit has also narrowed somewhat over the same period to around 6 per cent of GDP in the March quarter (assuming that the net income deficit remains constant as a share of GDP). ", " While the recovery in export earnings over the second half of 2003 was rather tentative, more recent data point to an increase in the pace of growth (Graph 46). The value of exports rose by around 2¾ per cent in the March quarter, reflecting a strong pick-up in the volume of rural exports, as farm production recovers from the effects of the drought. Ongoing gains in world commodity prices are also assisting growth in earnings by partially offsetting the dampening effect of the currency appreciation on Australian dollar export prices. ", " Rural exports have increased strongly from their drought-induced slump, rising in value by around 12 per cent in the March quarter, following a 7 per cent rise in the December quarter (Graph 47). To date, this increase has been driven largely by a rebound in exports of cereals, as the record 2003/04 winter crop is exported. However, the other major categories of rural exports also increased in value in the March quarter, particularly exports of meat. Looking ahead, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects a decline in the winter cereals crop in 2004/05, as some land used for cropping to generate income quickly following the drought reverts to other uses; consequently, growth in crop exports is expected to slow significantly over this period. Production of livestock-based products should increase steadily over the next few years, underpinning a gradual expansion in exports of these goods. ", " Service exports have also made a key contribution to the recent recovery in export earnings. The value of service exports grew rapidly over the second half of 2003, reflecting a resumption of international travel following the containment of SARS, tourist spending associated with the Rugby World Cup, and stronger world growth. Service exports have since paused at a high level as the impetus from the Rugby World Cup has waned, rising in value by ½ per cent in the March quarter; this is in line with ongoing strength in overseas arrivals relative to that in recent years (Graph 48). The outlook for service exports remains generally favourable, given improved prospects for global economic growth, and tourism bodies currently report high levels of forward bookings. ", " Following sharp falls in mid 2003, the value of resource exports fell further in the March quarter by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>, to be about 14 per cent lower than a year ago. The decline in earnings over the past year owes largely to a fall in Australian dollar prices, as the appreciation of the Australian dollar has more than offset rising world commodity prices evident since mid last year (see section on commodity prices and the terms of trade below). However, resource export volumes rose modestly over 2003, with a sharp increase in the December quarter retracing earlier falls. This recent pick-up in export volumes stems from rising global demand and efforts to redress capacity constraints; it has been most pronounced in exports of coal. While growth in volumes appears to have eased in the March quarter, strong investment in the mining sector is expected to expand capacity this year, which along with robust demand, should underpin firm growth in resource exports over 2004. ", " Manufactured exports have also shown signs of recovery, following weakness through much of 2003. In value terms, manufactured exports rose by 5 per cent in the March quarter, though they remained around 6 per cent lower over the year. The fall in values over 2003 was due largely to a decline in Australian dollar prices, as a result of falls in the world price of many manufactured goods coupled with the effects of the appreciation of the Australian dollar over this period. However, export volumes also fell over 2003, with manufacturers losing competitiveness in international markets. This fall in volumes contrasts with the rapid growth seen during <span class=\"no-wrap\">much of the 1990s</span>. With an upswing in world demand now firmly established and upward pressure on the Australian dollar easing recently, growth in manufactured export volumes is likely to resume over 2004. While the extent of the pick-up in manufactured export earnings in the March quarter suggests that a recovery is already underway, growth in the period ahead is likely to be more moderate than during the 1990s. ", " Import volumes continue to grow rapidly, with broad-based increases underpinned by robust growth in domestic spending and falling import prices (refer Graph 46). After rising modestly over the first half of 2003, import volumes increased at an annualised rate of 16 per cent over the second half of the year, more than double the trend rate. This reflected a jump in service imports as the stronger Australian dollar spurred a surge in international travel by Australians. Imports of goods also expanded at a firm pace in the second half of 2003, particularly consumption imports, which rose in line with robust consumer spending to be around 12 per cent higher over the year; imports of capital and intermediate goods were also sharply higher over the year. In contrast to the strength in volumes, the value of total imports declined by around 5 per cent over the year to the December quarter, as the currency appreciation has lowered Australian dollar import prices. However, an increase in import values of around 3½ per cent in the March quarter, despite another decline in prices, points to a further rapid expansion in import volumes. ", " The net income deficit rose slightly in the December quarter of 2003 to $5.9 billion, though at 3.0 per cent of GDP, it remains around its average of the past five years. This increase stemmed from a rise in net payments on foreign debt, consistent with the upward trend in Australia's net offshore borrowing. The rise in payments on foreign debt in the December quarter was partly offset by a decline in dividend payments on foreign holdings of Australian equity. ", " Commodity prices in SDR terms remain on a firm upward trend, buoyed by the global economic recovery and the associated pick-up in demand for raw materials. After rising strongly over the second half of 2003, the RBA Index of Commodity Prices increased by 3.1 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to April, to be 13½ per cent above its trough in May 2003 (Table 11, Graph 49). The increase over the latest three months was due to a strong rise in the prices of bulk commodities and, to a lesser extent, base metals. While the appreciation of the Australian dollar over the past year or so has restrained commodity prices in Australian dollar terms, they remain close to their average of the past decade. ", " Base metals prices have been volatile in 2004. Over the three months to April, they rose by 4.8 per cent in SDR terms, reflecting steep increases in the prices of copper and aluminium, taking year-ended growth to almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span>. These price increases have been driven by low stocks and expanding global industrial production, and have taken base metals prices close to 15-year highs. Despite the exchange rate appreciation, prices in Australian dollar terms have also increased significantly over the year to be well above the average level of the past decade. However, recent weeks have seen sharp falls in base metals prices in response to market concerns over the sustainability of growth in China. In addition, nickel prices have fallen in recent months, as earlier disruptions to supply have been resolved, but remain high as a result of buoyant demand and low inventories. ", " The prices of other resource commodities increased on average by 5.8 per cent over the three months to April, driven by increases in the prices of alumina, coal and iron ore. The export prices of coal and iron ore are heavily influenced by the outcomes of longer-term contract negotiations, and contract prices are currently lagging recent price strength evident in spot markets. The US dollar spot price of steaming coal has increased by nearly <span class=\"no-wrap\">110 per cent</span> over the past year in response to growing demand from Europe and Asia as well as shipping capacity constraints. Recent negotiations have secured large increases in steaming coal contract prices for 2004 – reportedly as high as 70 per cent in US dollar terms – which will substantially increase prices received by exporters in coming months. Rapid growth in global steel demand has also boosted contract prices for other bulk commodities; coking coal contract prices increased, on average, by 25–35 per cent in US dollar terms in recent negotiations, while iron ore contract prices have risen by close to 20 per cent. When the outcomes of recent contract negotiations have their full effect, they are likely to add around 6 percentage points to the RBA Index of Commodity Prices. ", " Rural commodity prices fell slightly over the three months to April, after increasing strongly over the second <span class=\"no-wrap\">half of 2003</span>. While rural prices are below the drought-induced peaks of 2002, they remain higher than the average of the past decade in both SDR and Australian dollar terms. ", " While growth in world prices for Australia's exports has been strong recently, growth in world prices for Australia's imports, particularly manufactured goods, has been quite weak. As a result, Australia's terms of trade has increased by 6.4 per cent over the past year, to its highest level in over 27 years (Graph 50). With considerable upward momentum in commodity prices, particularly for bulk commodities, the terms of trade is likely to have increased further in the first half of 2004. ", " While the cash rate has been held steady at 5.25 per cent so far in 2004, financial markets on balance continue to expect some further tightening in the months ahead. These expectations receded for a time during the March quarter in response to signs of some cooling in the housing market, strength in the exchange rate and reduced likelihood of a tightening by the US Fed after a couple of weak US employment numbers. By mid March the short-term yield curve had become quite flat. However, since then, even though the housing market still looks to be softening, expectations of a domestic monetary tightening in the months ahead have re-emerged (Graph 51). This has mainly been due to external factors – the growing signs of strength in the global economy and the bringing forward of expectations for a Fed tightening. Markets are currently pricing in a further tightening of <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> in the second half of 2004. In line with this, yields on 90-day bank bills are trading at 5.6 per cent and those on 180-day bills are at 5.7 per cent. ", " The same influences that caused short yields first to fall and then rise again have also impacted further out along the yield curve, with somewhat more pronounced effects. Yields on 10-year bonds fell by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 basis points</span>, to 5.3 per cent, by early March but are now around 5.9 per cent – a net rise of 25 basis points since the time of the last <em>Statement</em>. Yields on inflation-linked bonds have moved in a similar pattern and are now around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 per cent</span> (Graph 52). ", " The more pronounced movements in longer-term bond yields saw the spread between the yield on 10-year bonds and the cash rate rise in net terms over recent months to around 65 basis points. This is still below its average for the past decade. ", " The net rise in Australian long bond yields over recent months has been less than in corresponding US yields, so the spread between Australian and US yields has narrowed. In early May, it was around 135 basis points, around 20 basis points lower than earlier in the year (Graph 53). ", " There has been little change in the market's perceptions of credit risk during the past three months. Premia on credit default swaps (CDS), which measure the cost of insurance against a company defaulting, have increased slightly but remain close to their historical lows (Graph 54). While spreads between yields on highly-rated corporate bonds and government bonds have remained above their historical averages, this continues to reflect strong demand for Commonwealth Government bonds rather than concerns about corporate credit quality. Market contacts have reported that it also reflects the relatively high level of swap rates – a common benchmark for price-makers' funding costs – for reasons related more to the demand for funds than to credit concerns. Consistent with this, spreads between corporate bond yields and swap rates have moved much more in line with CDS than have spreads between corporate bonds and CGS. ", " Intermediaries' variable indicator lending rates have been unchanged since December 2003, consistent with there having been no change in the cash rate since then. Interest rates on fixed-rate loans to small business and for housing have fallen marginally since their respective peaks in late 2003, in line with the change in banks' cost of funding fixed-rate loans (Graph 55). The share of new housing loans taken out at fixed rates has fallen from a peak of around 15 per cent in November, to under 10 per cent in February, which is around the average for the past two years. The average 3-year fixed housing rate is currently around 7 per cent, just below the banks' predominant standard variable rate (Graph 56, Table 12). ", " Australian share prices have risen by 4 per cent since the time of the last <em>Statement</em>. The ASX 200 is currently <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> below its 2002 high, while the broader All Ordinaries index (which includes more companies and does not adjust the weights of companies for their ‘free float’) reached a new all-time high during March. The two indices have tracked each other closely during recent years, with the All Ordinaries rising only slightly faster than the ASX 200 since their lows in March 2003. ", " Since end January, Australian equities have risen by more than world equity prices and continued to be markedly less volatile (Graph 57). ", " Six out of the ten sector indices in the ASX 200 index have risen since end January (Table 13). The energy sector rose by 11 per cent, largely reflecting strong oil prices and refining margins and several exploration successes. In contrast, the materials sector fell slightly, in part due to some falls in commodity prices and concerns that demand from China may ease. The financials sector rose by 4 per cent on the back of strong profits results, particularly for insurance companies. The consumer discretionary sector has risen by 9 per cent since the previous <em>Statement</em>, with more than half of the increase occurring after the announcement of News Corporation's proposed plan to move its corporate headquarters to the US. ", " The Australian price/earnings (P/E) ratio has fallen slightly since the previous <em>Statement</em> to around 19, which is broadly in line with its long-run average. Australian dividend yields have continued to average just below <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent (Graph 58)</span>. ", " Australian non-government entities issued a record $44 billion of bonds in the March quarter, with financial institutions and asset-backed vehicles both issuing large amounts, particularly in offshore markets (Table 14). Issuance by non-financial institutions was relatively subdued, at $2.5 billion. ", " As usual, most offshore issuance was denominated in foreign currencies, with companies typically using swap markets to hedge the proceeds back to Australian dollars. Financial institutions continued to diversify their funding sources, borrowing predominantly in pounds sterling, euros and Canadian and US dollars, while asset-backed issuance was fairly evenly divided between US dollars and euros (Graph 59). ", " Non-residents' issuance of Australian-dollar denominated debt was also very strong, with $14 billion of bonds issued during the March quarter (Graph 60). Unlike the surge in non-residents' Australian dollar issuance that occurred in early 2003, which was driven by strong <em>Uridashi</em> issuance, the majority of the recent A$ issuance was into the domestic market. Issuers were split fairly evenly between financial institutions and supranational/government entities. <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> discusses some of the reasons for the recent strength in non-residents' issuance into the Australian market. ", " Total issuance of bonds in the Australian market by all non-government borrowers (including non-residents) was almost $20 billion in the first quarter of 2004, significantly up on the same period in earlier years (Graph 61). As a result of the record domestic issuance, outstandings of non-government debt are now almost triple the amount outstanding of either Commonwealth Government bonds or state government bonds, both of which were broadly unchanged in the March quarter at around $50 billion (Graph 62). ", " The growth rate of total credit remains strong, rising by 15 per cent over the year to March, a little below its growth rate of 15½ per cent at the beginning of the year. Household credit has continued to grow at the very high rates recorded over the second half of 2003, with only tentative signs of easing emerging. Business credit has slowed more noticeably, and has been the main contributor to the slight moderation in total credit growth. ", " Household credit continues to grow at a fast pace, increasing by 22 per cent over the year to March. The main driver of this growth has been borrowing for housing, with credit extended to both investors and owner-occupiers continuing to increase rapidly (Graph 63). However, there are early signs of a moderation in borrowing to fund the purchase of investor housing. Over the three months to March, credit extended to investors grew at an annualised pace of 26 per cent, compared with a rate of over 30 per cent during the second half of last year. In contrast to the easing in investor credit, growth in borrowing for owner-occupied housing has remained firm, consistent with its initial pick-up in the second half of last year having been less sharp than that for investor housing. Personal credit has also grown strongly, rising by 15 per cent over the year to March. ", " The recent falls in housing loan approvals point to the possibility of greater moderation in housing credit growth in the near term. However, as noted in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic Conditions</a>’, housing loan approvals remain at a high level, which suggests that further falls in approvals would be required for housing credit growth to fall to a sustainable pace. ", " Business credit has experienced a more marked turnaround in recent months than has housing credit, with falls recorded in the latest two months, reflecting a contraction in commercial loans and an easing in intermediation of businesses' debt securities. However, this follows two quarters of very strong growth in corporate borrowing and debt raisings, and the growth in business credit, of 6 per cent over the year to March, remains in line with the average of recent years. ", " On the liability side of intermediaries' balance sheets, the growth rate of the broader monetary aggregates has continued to rise. Broad money increased at an annual rate of 14 per cent over the six months to March, compared with 16 per cent growth in total credit (Graph 64). This narrowing in the difference between the rates of growth of broad money and total credit implies that, over this period, institutions relied relatively less on funding sources that are not included in broad money. ", " Net equity raisings totalled $4.5 billion in the March quarter (Graph 65). While this was down from the particularly strong raisings of $10 billion in the December quarter, the figure was in line with the quarterly average since the start of 2000. ", " Total credit increased at a rate of around 15 per cent over the year to March, only a little less than the peak rate reached at the beginning of the year. As has been the case over the past five years, credit expansion in recent months has primarily been driven by household sector borrowing, especially for housing. Housing-related credit expanded by 24 per cent over the year to March and, though growth has remained at an unsustainably rapid pace in recent months, loan approvals data point to some easing in the near future. In contrast, the strong growth in business credit seen late last year has been reversed, with falls recorded in the latest two months. ", " Early signs of easing in housing credit growth are most clearly evident in investor finance, consistent with a decline in sentiment towards purchasing investment properties. Despite recent moderation, investor housing credit still grew at a very rapid pace, increasing by 31 per cent over the year and at an annualised rate of 26 per cent over the three months to March. Growth in lending to owner-occupiers has also remained very strong, and only a little lower than the recent growth rate of investor housing credit. ", " Although the recent decline in the value of housing loan approvals does point to some moderation in housing credit growth in the coming months, at this stage, the value of loan approvals remains at a high level that is still consistent with rapid ongoing growth in credit. The measures announced by the NSW and Victorian state governments in April and May, discussed in more detail in the ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic Conditions</a>’ chapter, are expected to start to have some effect on loan approvals and credit over the next few months. While these changes should support the participation of owner-occupiers in these states, they are expected to make property investment less attractive in NSW. ", " The debt-servicing ratio on household borrowing has now surpassed its late 1980s peak, and is set to rise further over the first half of 2004, given current rates of household credit growth. At some point, increases in the debt-servicing ratio should eventually begin to constrain households' ability to increase their indebtedness. However, there are as yet no signs of such a constraint, with household credit still growing strongly. Consumer spending remains strong, with buoyant consumer sentiment and personal credit still growing at a firm pace. Credit remains readily available to prospective borrowers, despite reports that lenders had earlier tightened criteria on loans for the purchase of inner-city apartments. ", " In the business sector, balance sheets remain in good shape, and firms appear to have ample access to finance from a variety of sources. Despite the falls in recent months, business credit is around 6 per cent higher over the year to March. Businesses have access to a high level of internal funding from retained earnings, and they have been able to raise funds through equity and non-intermediated debt issuance. Solid investor sentiment has been reflected in the strong performance of the share market since March last year, and in the fact that a number of large initial public offerings are expected to take place over the next few months. Sentiment about corporate credit quality also remains positive, with spreads on corporate bonds over swap rates at low levels by historical standards. ", " The strength in credit growth, especially for households, has reflected strong demand for borrowing, a relatively low cost of finance and high consumer confidence. Both the cash rate and other variable lending rates remain below their averages over the past decade (Graph 66). While variable lending rates have remained unchanged since the end of last year, fixed housing and fixed small business lending rates have both fallen from their peaks late last year, by around 20 and 15 basis points respectively. ", " Despite large swings over the past month or so, the yield on 10-year bonds overall has risen slightly since the beginning of the year, largely mirroring events in US markets. This rise in Australian bond yields has resulted in a modest widening in their spread to the cash rate; that is, the yield curve has become a little steeper. Nonetheless, at around 65 basis points, the slope of the yield curve remains below its medium-term average (Graph 67). Normally, this would be read as an indicator of tighter-than-average financial conditions, but in the current situation it is probably best interpreted as symptomatic of developments in offshore markets. Global bond yields remain relatively low, reflecting expectations that global interest rates are still likely to remain low for some time, notwithstanding upward revisions to those expectations in the past couple of months. ", " The Australian dollar has depreciated from its mid-February peak, by around 6½ per cent on a trade-weighted basis, following a period of strong appreciation over the previous year and a half. As a result, the exchange rate is 10 per cent higher over the past year, and in real terms is around 11 per cent above its post-float average <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 68)</span>. The appreciation of the exchange rate occurred over a period when the general international environment became more favourable for Australian exporters in a number of respects. Australia's terms of trade, a measure of the relative price of Australia's exports to the price of imported items, rose to its highest level in <span class=\"no-wrap\">27 years</span> in the December quarter, and the recent strength in many international commodity prices, particularly in the resources sector, suggests that the terms of trade has risen further over the first few months of 2004. ", " The Consumer Price Index rose by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter to be 2.0 per cent higher over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year (Table 15)</span>. In year-ended terms, inflation has fallen significantly from 2.4 per cent recorded in December and just over 3 per cent a year or so ago (Graph 69). The effect of the exchange rate appreciation continues to be evident in falling traded goods prices, while domestic price pressures were again strong. The Bank's assessment, based on a range of different measures, is that underlying inflation over the past year has been at, or slightly above, 2 per cent. ", " Prices of tradables (excluding volatile items) fell by ½ per cent for the third successive quarter, to be 1.3 per cent lower over the year (Graph 70). In both quarterly and annual terms, there were sizeable falls in prices of a wide range of items, particularly for motor vehicles, audio, visual &amp; computing equipment, and overseas travel &amp; accommodation. ", " Inflation of non-tradable items was 1.1 per cent in the March quarter and remained above 4 per cent in year-ended terms. Firm price pressures were apparent across a range of non-tradable items. House purchase costs rose by 1.1 per cent in the quarter, and were up by around 6 per cent over the year. Liaison suggests that increases here are being driven in part by labour shortages and higher materials costs. In addition, prices of health and education continued to rise strongly, rising by around 7 per cent in year-ended terms. ", " Volatile items, such as fruit and vegetables, also contributed significantly to inflation: excluding such items, the CPI rose by only 0.5 per cent in the quarter. There was also a reasonably large contribution to inflation from items with prices that are publicly administered. Market prices, which exclude both administered and volatile items, were flat in the quarter and up by only 1.3 per cent in the year. In contrast, the other measures of underlying inflation were somewhat higher, at just over 2 per cent. ", " Indicators of producer price inflation by stage of production confirmed the sharp contrast between domestic and external sources of inflationary pressure. Domestically sourced inflation was a little stronger in the March quarter, with domestic inflation at the final stage of production rising to 4.1 per cent in year-ended terms. In contrast, imported producer prices continued to fall; at all stages of production they were 3 to 5 per cent lower in the quarter, and fell by around 15 per cent over the year (Table 16). ", " At the final stage of production, construction costs continued to contribute significantly to price inflation, rising by 2.4 per cent in the quarter and by 8.2 per cent over the year. The Davis Langdon Tender Price Index – which prices a fixed basket of labour and material inputs typically used in commercial and apartment construction – confirms this trend, though there are emerging signs that costs may have peaked in some regions, particularly Melbourne (Graph 71). ", " Most labour cost indicators suggest that wages growth edged higher in the second half of 2003. This is consistent with signs that labour-market conditions remained relatively firm. In the December quarter, the wage cost index (WCI) for total pay increased by 1.0 per cent, to be 3.7 per cent higher than a year earlier <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 72)</span>. Similarly, unit labour costs (based on compensation per hour worked) picked up a little in the December quarter, rising by 1.4 per cent to be 2.3 per cent higher than a year ago. This annual growth rate is close to the average of the past few years. ", " The pick-up in the WCI data in the second half of 2003 partly reflected the spreading out of increases in wage pressures to a broader range of industries, after having been concentrated in public-sector and related industries earlier in the year (Table 17). Growth in wage costs increased in manufacturing, retail trade and property &amp; business services. Labour cost pressures also remain firm in the construction sector; a recent survey by the Master Builders Association suggests that labour shortages remain most acute in trades exposed to the latter stages of the building process, contributing to ongoing pressure on rates for subcontractors. ", " Data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) indicate an average annualised rate of wages growth of 4.0 per cent incorporated into new enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) certified in the December quarter. This remains at the higher end of outcomes over the past few years, though slightly below the most recent peak of 4.4 per cent in June 2003. Wage increases for the stock of existing agreements averaged 3.9 per cent in the December quarter, slightly higher than the average rate since mid 2002. The Mercer Quarterly Salary Review indicated that annual growth in the base salaries of executives increased marginally to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.7 per cent</span> in the March quarter, after picking up over the second half of last year. In its Safety Net Review decision, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission granted a $19 increase in award rates of pay. As a result, the federal minimum wage increased by 4.2 per cent to $467.40 per week. ", " The various measures of inflation expectations have diverged a little of late, though the differences are not great, and most observers continue to regard the inflation outlook as benign (Table 18). Among financial market economists surveyed by the Bank, the median inflation expectation has risen slightly in the near term. This is partly due to higher-than-expected quarterly inflation in March, but it also seems to indicate some upward revision to expectations for the June quarter. Longer-term expectations are only slightly higher than they were in February. In contrast, union officials revised their inflation forecasts down slightly, though they remain higher than those of financial market economists at longer horizons. ", " Business surveys continue to suggest that the near-term outlook for inflation is subdued. The quarterly NAB business survey reported that inflationary pressures are expected to decline marginally in coming months, and the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturing firms points to a more pronounced reduction in inflationary pressures. Manufacturers surveyed by the AIG indicate that falls in their selling prices are in prospect in coming quarters. ", " Among consumers, measures of inflation expectations were a little higher. According to the Melbourne Institute survey, the median expectation for consumer price inflation over the coming year rebounded to 4.6 per cent in April from last month's reading of 3.6 per cent (Graph 73). Looking through the monthly volatility, this series has shown no trend over the past few years. ", " By contrast, the longer-term inflation expectations of financial market participants have risen slightly over the past three months. Expectations of inflation, as measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, are now around 2.5 per cent. In part, this increase might be a mechanical response of nominal yields to developments in world bond markets, rather than signalling a lasting change in the financial market's view of the inflation outlook in Australia. ", " The Bank estimates that underlying inflation in year-ended terms eased further in the March quarter to a little above 2 per cent. This development had been broadly anticipated in previous <em>Statements</em>, though the most recent decline was slightly less than expected. The overall decline in inflation from its peak a year ago reflects the continuing effects of the appreciation of the exchange rate. These effects are likely to continue to dampen inflation in the short term, though they should start to dissipate towards the end of this year, after which the inflation rate is expected to move up to levels more in line with its domestic determinants. As a result, underlying inflation is likely to trough at an annual rate of around 1¾ per cent at the end of 2004, rising to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span> by late 2005. ", " CPI inflation in year-ended terms should stay in a narrow range around this profile over much of the forecast horizon, though volatility in oil and food prices over the past year will continue to have some effect on the year-ended figures in future quarters. In addition, CPI inflation will be dampened slightly during 2005 by a range of tariff reductions. These forecasts incorporate the usual technical assumptions of an unchanged exchange rate around recent levels, and a gradual decline in international oil prices to around their medium-term average in <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> terms. ", " The domestically generated risks to this outlook lean slightly toward the upside. The demand pressures already apparent in some sectors might increase and therefore add more to domestic cost pressures than is currently expected. In addition, the global economy has clearly gained momentum over recent months and could accelerate further, creating an increasingly favourable environment for growth of the Australian economy in the period ahead. Over time, the stronger global environment could also generate further upward pressure on commodity prices and hence manufacturing costs, and on traded goods prices more generally. ", " The main source of downside risk to inflation identified in the previous <em>Statement</em> was associated with the appreciation of the exchange rate. In particular there had appeared a risk that the exchange rate would continue to appreciate, or that the appreciation to date would be passed through into prices more fully than expected, as a result of competitive pressures in the retail sector. In these circumstances, inflation in the short term would decline more quickly than forecast. These risks have decreased somewhat over the past three months. The exchange rate has declined from its February peak, while the rate of pass-through into domestic prices has been if anything a little smaller to date than might have been expected. ", " With a population of nearly 1.1 billion, India is the second most populous country in the world, behind China with 1.3 billion people. India's economy has performed strongly in recent years, with GDP growth averaging an impressive 6.1 per cent annually over the past 10 years (Graph A1). While not as rapid as the growth of China in that period, this growth performance has steadily increased India's weight in the global economy. It is now the world's fourth largest economy on a purchasing power parity basis, behind the US, China and Japan, and accounts for some <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.7 per cent</span> of world output. At market exchange rates, India ranks as the 12th largest economy, accounting for 1.6 per cent of world output. Contributing to this performance has been a program of economic liberalisation, including increased openness to foreign trade and investment, financial sector deregulation and a more prominent role for the private sector. ", " Agriculture accounts for nearly 25 per cent of India's GDP, although this proportion has been declining over time as the services sector and, to a lesser extent, manufacturing have become more important. The industrial sector makes up around 25 per cent of GDP, while services currently account for just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 per cent</span>. Most of the labour force, however, still works in the agricultural sector. ", " International trade accounts for a relatively modest share of economic activity in India. India's openness to trade as measured by the sum of exports and imports as a ratio to GDP was around 30 per cent in 2003. This is well below the median level of openness globally, which was around 75 per cent in 2002. However, this is not surprising given that large economies – in terms of area and population – typically have a very large share of trading activity occurring within national borders. Also, India still has relatively restrictive foreign trade policies compared with international norms, notwithstanding recent reforms in this area. Overall, India accounted for 0.8 per cent of world merchandise trade in 2003, up from 0.6 per cent in 1990, leaving it outside the top 20 trading nations. This compares with China's current rank as the third largest trading nation in the world, accounting for around 6 per cent of world merchandise trade. ", " Nonetheless, India's trade has been increasing rapidly, growing at an average annual rate in real terms of around 13 per cent over the past 10 years – twice the rate of overall world trade. India's largest trading partners are the euro area and the US. However, trade with Asia (particularly China) has been growing very rapidly in recent years. Although India runs a merchandise trade deficit (2½ per cent of GDP in 2002/03), it has a modest surplus on the current account (0.8 per cent of GDP in 2002/03), owing to sizeable inward current transfers and a surplus for net services. In real terms service exports have been growing at an average annual rate of close to 20 per cent over the past 10 years. Software and information technology services have been key drivers of this growth, and make up almost half of India's service exports. ", " India accounted for 2.2 per cent of Australian merchandise exports in 2002/03, making it Australia's 11th largest export market. Australia exports mostly resources to India, including coking coal and metal ores. More recently, India has also become a much more important destination for Australian gold exports. Exports of gold are largely responsible for the sharp increase in resource exports to India over the past year, although this has been at the expense of alternative markets such as in east Asia and the EU, as Australia's total gold exports have not increased significantly over this period. Excluding gold, growth in resource exports to India has been much more subdued (Graph A2). ", " In contrast to exports, India accounts for only a small share of Australian merchandise imports, at around <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.7 per cent</span> in 2002/03. Australia imports mainly manufactured items from India, with the most important items by value being textiles and clothing, machinery and non-metallic minerals. ", " After a two-year hiatus, a broad range of non-resident issuers returned to the Australian bond market in <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 2003</span> and were particularly active in the first quarter of 2004 (Graph B1). While these entities' total Australian dollar raisings typically represent a small share of their overall raisings – around 5 per cent in the case of supranationals – they are an important source of credit diversification (without currency risk) for local investors. ", " The increase in issuance has been due to a fall in the relative cost of issuing debt in Australia. The two main components of this are corporate bond spreads and the cost of hedging the proceeds back to the home currency of the issuer. (The available evidence suggests non-residents swap the bulk of their Australian dollar issuance back into their home currencies.) ", " Credit spreads (relative to swap rates) in the Australian bond market have been quite low recently for both non-government and government non-resident borrowers, and are likely to have encouraged the surge in Australian dollar issuance (Graph B2). One factor contributing to the low spreads may be the strength of demand for such debt by investors who regard it as an alternative to CGS, which are in short supply. Demand is also coming from foreign investors, including central banks, seeking an Australian dollar exposure. The broadening of the RBA's eligibility criteria for market operations, to include a wider range of bonds issued by foreign governments, at the margin has also increased demand for these bonds. ", " Foreign borrowers issuing in Australia and seeking to swap back to their home currency usually receive favourable prices in the currency swap market because of greater demand by Australian borrowers to do the reverse – i.e. borrow in foreign currency and swap into Australian dollars. Record foreign currency bond issuance by Australian entities in 2004 has pushed up the cost of converting foreign currency to Australian dollars and made it cheap for foreigners to do the opposite (Graph B3). ", " While corporate spreads in major foreign markets have also declined in recent months, this has not been sufficient to offset the combined effect of the fall in Australian credit spreads and the rise in currency swap premia. As a result, the relative cost of issuing in Australia has decreased. "], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2004/may/1.html"},

Recent data for the US have confirmed that the economy is expanding at a good pace and is generating solid gains in employment. China's economy has become an increasingly important driver of world growth, with last year's growth outcome of nearly 10 per cent exceeding most expectations. In other parts of the world, including Japan and the euro area, the economic recovery is continuing, though at a slower pace than in the first half of 2004. Despite some slowing, growth remains quite strong in most of the smaller east Asian economies. The tsunami disaster is unlikely to have a major impact on aggregate GDP in the Asian region but will reduce growth in the short term in Indonesia and Thailand, as well as in some smaller economies on the Indian Ocean rim. Overall, most observers expect growth of the world economy, though not as strong as last year, to continue in 2005 at an above-average pace for the third successive year. ", " The strong global economy has contributed to upward pressure on commodity prices in the past couple of years. One important aspect of this was the sharp rise in oil prices, which peaked in October last year. While the rise in oil prices was seen as primarily a consequence of strong global demand, supply disruptions also played a role, and much attention last year was focused on the possible impact that higher prices might have on global economic performance. With oil prices in recent months having fluctuated in a range somewhat below their October peak, risks to the global economy from that source appear to have lessened. ", " Prices of a range of other mineral commodities have generally remained firm or increased further over recent months. For Australia, this is providing a significant stimulus to national income and spending, with the prospect of more to come. World prices of Australia's base metals exports are now around 40 per cent higher than they were two years ago. For iron ore and coal, substantial increases in contract prices are set to take effect later this year, building on the already sharp increases of last year. In addition to boosting incomes and spending in Australia, the effects of rising commodity prices are also being seen in producer prices more generally. ", " In international financial markets the main development recently has been the continued decline in the US dollar. In the final three months of last year the US dollar declined by 8 per cent against the euro and 7 per cent against the yen, to be around its lowest level in the past decade. Since the beginning of 2005, the US dollar has recovered somewhat against the euro, but has remained around its recent lows against the yen and other <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian currencies</span>. Movements in the US dollar have continued to be the major influence on the Australian dollar over the past few months. The domestic currency has generally traded in a range of US76 to US79 cents, and is around the middle of that range at present. The Australian dollar's movement against other floating currencies has been modest. ", " Given the strength of the US economy, the Federal Reserve has further tightened monetary policy and financial markets expect this to continue. Even so, US government bond yields have remained remarkably stable at around 4¼ per cent. In Australia, market yields, particularly at the short end, have risen since early December, reflecting stronger employment and prices data. ", " Most economic data in Australia have continued to suggest strong conditions recently. Particularly noteworthy in recent months has been the performance of the labour market, with employment posting a series of big increases and the unemployment rate declining to its lowest level since the 1970s. In addition, most business surveys reported conditions that were at high levels throughout 2004, while consumer confidence has been close to record levels. The high level of confidence was also reflected in the Australian share market, which outperformed the markets of all other major countries during 2004. Overall, while the national accounts had reported a surprisingly weak outcome for growth in the September quarter, the range of other available information suggests that the economy was in a strong condition through last year and is likely to have maintained a good pace of growth entering 2005. With a favourable international environment, high levels of confidence domestically, and further rises in the terms of trade adding to national income, the prospects are that demand conditions will continue to encourage growth in the period ahead. ", " Given these conditions, a key issue for the Australian economy will be the extent to which the ongoing growth of demand might give rise to capacity constraints and, consequently, upward pressure on wage and price inflation. With the expansion now in its fourteenth year, there is clearly much less spare capacity available than was the case in its early stages. The general performance of the economy in 2004, when production was unable to keep up with the strength of global and domestic demand, is suggestive that capacity constraints may be becoming more important. ", " The clearest indication of emerging pressures on capacity has been in the disappointing performance of exports to date, which has been associated with a widening of Australia's current account deficit. While there has been a modest recovery in export volumes from the trough reached in mid 2003, this has so far only lifted exports back to around their level at the start of the decade. One factor likely to have contributed to this disappointing performance is the strong growth of domestic demand over recent years, which may have adversely affected manufactured and service exports. Additionally, there are a number of areas in the mining sector where supply bottlenecks have held back export growth recently, though there are indications that capacity expansions in that area are now in train. ", " Inflation outcomes during 2004 were higher than had been expected at the start of the year. The CPI increased by 0.8 per cent in the December quarter and by 2.6 per cent over the year. This was boosted by rising petrol prices, so that underlying measures were somewhat lower, generally around 2¼ per cent over the year. For the past couple of years, underlying inflation has been held down by the lagged effects of the exchange rate appreciation that took place during 2002 and 2003, but the maximum impact from that source has now passed. Hence it is likely that underlying inflation has now reached its low point and that it will start rising during 2005. Domestically-sourced inflation has been running faster over the past couple of years and there has been a significant pick-up in domestic producer prices recently, associated with rising materials costs and strong demand pressures in some sectors. At this stage, the overall rise in inflation over the next two years is forecast to be gradual, with inflation in both headline and underlying terms expected to be around 3 per cent by the end of 2006. However, given the firm demand conditions in prospect, the possibility that wage and price pressures will build more quickly cannot be ruled out. ", " The adjustment in the Australian housing market during 2004 should assist prospects for sustainable economic growth, with the decline in house prices and new lending during much of the year alleviating the overheating which had previously been apparent in that part of the economy. More recently, there have been some signs of prices and finance levelling out, or possibly rising. Data on house prices for the December quarter were a little firmer than earlier in the year, and the demand for housing finance picked up towards the end of the year. It is too early, however, to tell whether these latest developments represent a significant change in trend. ", " The cooling in the housing market during 2004 was associated with an easing in credit growth to the household sector from the exceptionally high rates seen in the previous year. Nevertheless, the growth of credit to both the household and business sectors remains high, with aggregate credit growth still running at an annual rate of <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> over the six months to December 2004. The overall strength in demand for credit, combined with the fact that interest rates remain slightly lower than the average of recent years, continues to suggest that the current policy setting is not inhibiting the growth of the economy. ", " In its recent policy deliberations the key focus of the Board has been on whether continuing strength of demand conditions would give rise to significant inflation pressures. At its December meeting, as in earlier months, the Board judged that a further tightening of monetary policy would probably be required in due course, but that there was no need for action in the short term. Information becoming available over the subsequent two months for the February meeting tended to confirm the strength of both domestic and international demand, and gave early signs of a pick-up in inflation, as had been expected. ", " At this stage, the Board's judgement is still that this pick-up in inflation will be quite gradual, with inflation reaching 2½ per cent this year and 3 per cent next year. Nonetheless, continued pressure on raw materials prices, evidence of capacity constraints in some sectors and reports of higher employment costs – notwithstanding the steadiness to date of aggregate series for wages – constitute a risk that this forecast could prove to be too low. On balance, the Board decided at its February meeting to leave interest rates unchanged, while noting that the likelihood of further monetary tightening being required in the months ahead had increased. The Board will continue to monitor developments over coming months and will respond as necessary to ensure that rising inflation does not jeopardise the sustainable expansion of the Australian economy. ", " The world economy appears to have entered 2005 with a good degree of momentum. The latest Consensus forecasts are for global growth of 4.2 per cent in 2005, implying another year of well-above average growth <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 1)</span>. This would constitute only a modest slowing from estimated growth in 2004 of <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.9 per cent</span>, around the fastest rate in nearly 30 years. The United States and China continue to lead the way, but recent GDP outcomes from Japan and the euro area have been noticeably softer. While it is too early to assess the economic cost of the south Asian tsunami fully, at this stage the overall impact on GDP is expected to be limited as the major population and industrial centres were largely undamaged. ", " The US economy continues to grow strongly as it enters its fourth year of recovery. Real GDP advanced by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.8 per cent</span> in the December quarter, to be 3.7 per cent higher over the year (Graph 1). Solid growth in the quarter reflected a strong increase in household spending and the continued upswing in business investment, while net external demand again subtracted from growth, reflecting a fall in exports and continued rapid import growth. ", " There have been clear signs of improvement in the labour market over the past six months or so. An average of more than 160,000 jobs were added per month in the second half of 2004 and the unemployment rate fell from 5.6 per cent to 5.4 per cent in December. Nevertheless, it is likely that there is still substantial slack in the labour market, as poor employment prospects until recently discouraged some people from participating in the labour force. Forward indicators of employment remain positive, with recent data for initial jobless claims and the employment indices from the manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISM surveys at levels that are consistent with strong employment gains in the period ahead. Solid growth in the number of temporary-help jobs, which tends to lead employment growth, provides another positive sign (Graph 2). ", " The brighter conditions in the labour market have supported consumer spending as the effects of the fiscal stimulus earlier in 2004 have waned. Household consumption rose by 1.1 per cent in the December quarter, to be 3.9 per cent higher over the year. Rising household wealth and still low interest rates have also provided a boost to consumption. While growth in household wealth eased over the September quarter, wealth increased by more than 10 per cent over the year, propelled by rapid gains in house prices. The recent rally in the equity market should have contributed to a further rise in wealth in the December quarter. Reflecting the generally favourable economic environment, consumer sentiment has lifted in recent months to be a touch above its long-run average. ", " Indicators from the business sector generally suggest that conditions are still quite favourable. Profits have risen sharply over the past year, corporate balance sheets are healthy, and business sentiment remains positive. Together with ready access to low-cost financing, this has underpinned a brisk pick-up in business investment. In the December quarter, investment increased by 2.5 per cent, to be 9.9 per cent higher over the year, partly reflecting a bring-forward of expenditure ahead of the expiration of the accelerated depreciation allowance on <span class=\"no-wrap\">31 December</span>. Encouragingly, in recent quarters growth in equipment investment has broadened across components, rather than being largely concentrated in the ITC area as in the earlier stages of the recovery. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISM indices, while down from the peaks seen in early 2004, are still at high levels and a number of other measures of business sentiment paint a similarly positive picture (Graph 3). Profits of non-financial corporates rose by 19 per cent over the year to the September quarter, and are very high as a share of GDP, though profits of financial corporates were adversely affected by higher insurance payouts following the string of hurricanes that hit the US in the September quarter. Consistent with the favourable fundamentals, there was continued growth in core capital goods orders, which are a leading indicator of equipment investment. ", " The robust rate of spending by US households and businesses has resulted in a sharp increase in imports into the US, with the volume of imports increasing by 9.2 per cent over the year to the December quarter. Export volumes increased by 4.1 per cent over the same period, reflecting modest overall growth among key trading partners. As a result of these trends, the external trade deficit has widened to 5.7 per cent of GDP, and imports are now around 60 per cent larger than the level of exports. ", " Core inflation has been gradually trending higher, albeit from very low levels. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose by 2.2 per cent over the year to December, up from 1.1 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">late 2003 (Graph 4)</span>. However, inflation measures derived from personal consumption expenditures (PCE) show a more muted increase. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve has continued the process of normalising interest rates, lifting the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of its last six meetings, to 2.5 per cent in February. ", " The Japanese economy is continuing to recover, but the pace has shifted down since late 2003 and early 2004. Real GDP grew by 0.1 per cent in the September quarter, having contracted by 0.1 per cent in the June quarter, though in year-ended terms growth was a healthier 2.5 per cent (Graph 5). The restatement of Japan's national accounts on a chain-weighted basis confirmed that the accounts had for several years been overstating growth in real GDP. Nominal GDP, which was unaffected by the changes, was steady in the September quarter and increased by 1.0 per cent over the year. While the pattern of the recent GDP data has been uneven, the message from business surveys and the labour market has been more positive. ", " The slowing in activity has been largely concentrated in the business and external sectors, consistent with the moderation of the global ITC cycle and the easing in demand seen in other countries. Industrial production growth fell to 1.4 per cent over the year to December. According to a range of surveys, business sentiment eased in the December quarter but remains healthy (Graph 6). Machinery orders rose sharply in November, having drifted lower in the previous four months. Merchandise exports also rebounded in the December quarter. The overall financial position of firms remains sound – corporate debt has fallen as a share of GDP to levels not seen since the 1980s. Business surveys indicate that the excess labour and capacity problems of the past decade have been largely worked off. The banking sector seems likely to meet the government's targets for reducing non-performing loans to around 4 per cent of total lending by the end of March, and the decline in bank lending appears to be moderating. In all, the corporate sector seems well placed to provide the impetus for ongoing growth in the Japanese economy. ", " Conditions are still generally favourable in the Japanese labour market. Despite some monthly volatility, the unemployment rate remains on a downward trend and has fallen by ½ percentage point over the past year to reach 4.4 per cent in December. This partly reflects a shrinking labour force owing to the ageing of the population, but it is consistent with the payrolls survey, which reports that employment has grown by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">½ per cent</span> over the year. Forward-looking indicators, including firms' hiring intentions and consumers' perceived employment prospects, are also positive. ", " Keying off a healthier labour market and buoyant consumer sentiment, household spending rose by 2.1 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Consumer spending has held up despite ongoing falls in real household income, as households appear increasingly willing to save at a lower rate. The weakness in household income has been largely a result of firms' efforts to restrain average wages growth by substituting part-time for full-time workers. The effect of falling average wages has generally outweighed that of rising employment, contributing to the softness in labour income. The government has announced that in the 2005 fiscal year it will repeal the tax cuts introduced in 1999, which may exert a dampening influence on household spending. ", " With activity measures still fairly upbeat, deflationary pressures have eased further. Domestic corporate goods prices rose by 1.9 per cent over the year to December – the fastest pace of growth since the early 1990s – largely reflecting the run-up in global commodity prices. Sharply rising fresh food prices in the wake of recent typhoons pushed year-ended consumer price inflation to 0.2 per cent in December. Excluding fresh food, consumer prices fell by 0.2 per cent over 2004, with a boost from higher energy prices. The new chain-weighted GDP deflator also indicates some lessening in the rate of deflation, being 1.4 per cent lower over the year to the September quarter compared with 1.7 per cent lower over the year to the June quarter. Nationwide land prices are yet to show much sign of turning around, though, declining by 7.9 per cent over the year to the September quarter. ", " The Chinese economy continues to perform strongly, though the pace of growth eased somewhat during 2004. Over the past couple of years China has directly accounted for a quarter of overall growth in the world economy and has made a similar contribution to growth in global trade. China's real GDP rose by 9.5 per cent over the year to the December quarter (Graph 7). Growth in industrial production has slowed gradually but remains strong; production expanded by 14.4 per cent over the year to December, down from a peak of 19.4 per cent in March. Merchandise trade continues to grow very rapidly, reflecting the competitiveness of China's exports in world markets and strong domestic demand. Exports increased by around 33 per cent over the year to December, while imports were 25 per cent higher. Growth in retail sales has risen in recent months. ", " Since late 2003, the Chinese authorities have implemented a series of measures aimed at generating a more sustainable mix of growth. The measures have been directed at curbing over-investment in certain sectors of the economy (such as cement, steel, and property), and reining in credit and money supply growth. Year-ended growth in credit and the money supply seems to have stabilised recently, at around 14½ per cent over the year to December, following a pronounced deceleration earlier in the year. The People's Bank of China is aiming for <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> growth in the money supply in 2005. In the case of investment, fixed-asset investment increased by 21 per cent over the year to December. While this indicates a slowing in the pace of growth during 2004, as a share of GDP investment is estimated to have risen to around 45 per cent in 2004, which is the highest level on record and about as high an investment share as has been seen anywhere in the world. ", " Consumer price inflation eased to 2.4 per cent over the year to December, down from the peak of 5.3 per cent in the middle of the year (Graph 8). The easing in price pressure largely reflects an unwinding of the earlier run-up in food prices; the ex-food measure has drifted higher to be up by around 1½ per cent over the year. Upstream price pressures continue to be evident, with producer prices rising by 7.1 per cent over the year to December. ", " Elsewhere in east Asia, economic growth has also slowed a little recently, but remains solid (Graph 9). In aggregate, GDP increased by 5.6 per cent over the year to the September quarter, with particularly strong growth recorded in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Exports continued to advance at a vigorous rate, though not quite as quickly as earlier in the year. With the exception of Korea, conditions appear favourable for a continued pick-up in domestic activity. ", " While it is still too early to make a full assessment of the economic effect of the south Asian tsunami, at this stage it seems that the overall effect on GDP will be modest in relation to the size of the region's economy. Some countries will be more affected than others: the Maldives and Sri Lanka are expected to be the hardest hit, and the Thai and Indonesian economies are also likely to be affected. ", " Growth in the region's exports has slowed from the very brisk pace earlier in 2004, but remains strong. Merchandise exports were 14 per cent higher over the year to December, down from 29 per cent in May. This is consistent with the easing in global demand for ITC goods, which account for around 35 per cent of the region's exports. Growth in world semiconductor sales, a widely used indicator of the state of the global ITC cycle, fell from 40 per cent in year-ended terms in June to 15 per cent in December (Graph 10). Nevertheless, ongoing strength in the Chinese economy continues to support export growth. ", " Recent indicators suggest a positive outlook for domestic demand. Retail sales picked up in the December quarter in most countries, and capacity utilisation rates are at levels not seen since before the Asian financial crisis. Labour markets in the region continue to improve, though some slack remains. Furthermore, growth in property and equity prices should spur household and business spending, along with continuing accommodative policy settings. Korea remains the exception, adversely affected by weak consumer spending, which has been weighed down by excessive household debt. There has been some progress in strengthening household balance sheets in Korea, but debt-stress indicators are still high and this process seems likely to have further to run. The recent increase in unemployment, low consumer confidence and falling house prices also suggest a recovery in consumption is some way off. In order to support domestic demand, the Bank of Korea cut its policy rate by a further <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> in November, to 3.25 per cent. The government is also planning a sizeable fiscal package in 2005. ", " Higher food and oil prices led to a marked increase in consumer price inflation throughout the region in mid 2004, particularly in Thailand, Singapore, Korea and the Philippines. More recently, inflation has moderated in most economies in line with easing food and oil prices. Underlying measures of inflation remain relatively contained, though they appear to be on a gentle uptrend, consistent with upstream inflation measures. Together with buoyant activity, this has seen most central banks in the region continue to tighten policy. ", " In India, aggregate growth has slowed considerably, reflecting weak agricultural production. Real GDP increased by 6½ per cent over the year to the September quarter, down from 10½ per cent over the course of 2003. Industrial production continues to advance strongly, rising by around 8 per cent over the year to November, and merchandise exports climbed sharply in the December quarter. Inflation has eased a little in recent months following a noticeable rise in the middle of the year. The wholesale price index – the preferred inflation measure in India – was 6.5 per cent higher over the year to December, having risen by 8.7 per cent over the year to August. ", " The New Zealand economy is growing strongly. GDP expanded by 0.6 per cent in the September quarter, to be 4.4 per cent higher over the year. Domestic demand remains the driver of growth, rising by 8.3 per cent over the year. In contrast, net exports have been a significant drag on growth, largely because of weak merchandise exports. Consumer demand is being underpinned by strong labour market conditions; the unemployment rate is currently 3.8 per cent, which is its lowest level since the early 1980s. The relative strength of the domestic economy is also evident in the inflation data. Non-tradables inflation was 4.3 per cent over the year to the December quarter, while tradables inflation was only 0.7 per cent over the period. ", " Economic data from the euro area have been disappointing in recent months. Euro-wide GDP expanded by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in the September quarter, and year-ended growth eased to 1.8 per cent as a result of a fall in export growth (Table 2). The earlier variation in the pace and composition of growth among the member countries narrowed in the September quarter, as GDP growth slowed sharply in France and remained subdued in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Spain was the only major economy to maintain respectable growth. There has also been a slowing in industrial production; year-ended growth fell from around 3 per cent in the middle of the year to 0.7 per cent in November, reflecting falls in German and Italian production. This is consistent with developments in the manufacturing PMI, which declined over the second half of 2004 and is currently only modestly above neutral levels. ", " Domestic demand will need to pick up if the recovery in the euro area is to gather pace. To date, there has been only a gradual upturn in investment despite strong profit growth and positive business sentiment (Graph 11). Euro-wide retail sales fell slightly in the three months to November. In Germany, household consumption has not expanded since the first quarter of 2003. Circumstances are slightly more encouraging in France, where households are benefiting from wealth gains associated with double-digit house price growth. The recovery of household spending in France stalled in the September quarter, with consumption falling by 0.2 per cent, but the sharp increases in retail spending observed in the December quarter suggest this was probably a temporary setback. ", " Euro-wide measures of business confidence are holding above long-run average levels and could help support a continuing recovery. Ongoing optimism in France has offset some weakening of business confidence in Germany and Italy. In contrast, household sentiment remains subdued. Although it has drifted up in recent months, consumer sentiment is still below long-run average levels, held down by concerns about high unemployment and the effect of structural reforms that are under way (Graph 12). Euro-wide unemployment was 8.9 per cent in December. ", " Despite the soft economic growth, inflation has lingered above the ECB's 2 per cent reference level. Euro area consumer prices rose by 2.4 per cent over the year to December, with higher energy prices making a significant contribution, along with hikes in prices of administered items, such as health care and tobacco. In underlying terms, inflation has been steady at 1.9 per cent. The ECB has emphasised the risk of increased energy costs feeding through into wages and general inflation, but given lacklustre output growth, it has kept its policy rate at 2 per cent since June 2003. ", " Growth in the United Kingdom has begun to moderate as the housing sector has responded to the tightening of monetary policy over the past year or so. After slowing in the September quarter, GDP rose by a solid 0.7 per cent in the December quarter. Year-ended growth fell to 2.8 per cent, from a peak of 3.5 per cent in the June quarter. Although export growth remains healthy, net exports subtracted 0.7 percentage points from GDP growth over the year to the September quarter, reflecting growth in imports from strong domestic demand. ", " Official data suggest that industrial production contracted slightly over the year to November, but other measures show a brighter picture. Surveys of consumer and business confidence are generally above long-run averages and unemployment is near its lowest level in almost 30 years. However, activity in the housing market has slowed noticeably from its heady pace earlier in the year. Surveys and official data indicate flat or falling house prices across the UK; according to the Nationwide and Halifax surveys, house prices increased at an annualised rate of 1.8 per cent over the past three months, compared with annualised growth in excess of 20 per cent in the first half of 2004. The value of housing loan approvals was down by 25 per cent from the peak in late 2003. ", " Despite a tight labour market and strong growth in input prices, consumer price inflation was 1.6 per cent over the year to December, below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target rate. The Monetary Policy Committee has held the repo rate at 4.75 per cent since August. ", " After peaking at around US$56 per barrel in late October, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price has fallen back in recent months to around US$47 per barrel in early February (Graph 13). The fall in prices appears to reflect the easing of a number of the supply concerns and speculative pressures that had pushed prices to levels that were generally perceived as above those dictated by long-run fundamentals. However, the easing in price pressures, which saw crude oil prices fall to around US$41 per barrel in early December, has been interrupted by the resolution of OPEC on 10 December to curtail above-quota production of oil, owing to concerns that prices would continue to fall. The market has also been affected by ongoing supply disruptions in Iraq, which have arisen from technical difficulties and sabotage ahead of the Iraqi elections. ", " The broad-based decline in the US dollar that had resumed in October continued apace through to the end of 2004 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 14, Table 3)</span>. In the December quarter, the US dollar declined by 8 per cent against the euro, 7 per cent against the yen and 5 per cent on a broad trade-weighted basis. The decline primarily reflected the market's focus on the US current account deficit. During this period, the dollar reached a low of 102 against the yen, and 1.365 against the euro – the lowest level since the latter's introduction in 1999. Using the European Currency Unit (the precursor to the euro) as a proxy, the bilateral exchange rate against the euro area was the lowest since 1992, when it reached the equivalent of 1.45. ", " A notable feature of the most recent movement in the US dollar is that it has also depreciated significantly against a number of east Asian currencies such as the Korean won. The Korean won rose 10 per cent against the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> in the December quarter despite the reduction in Korean policy rates, weaker economic data and exchange rate intervention. This is in contrast to the situation in late 2003/early 2004 when movements in many east Asian currencies were limited by substantial central bank intervention in the market. ", " Thus far in 2005, the dollar has risen back to around 1.30 against the euro, in part reflecting the fact that the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US federal funds rate</span> has now risen above the monetary policy rate in the euro area, as well as comments from European officials expressing concerns about the extent of the appreciation of the euro. The dollar has also appreciated against a number of the other major currencies, including the pound and Canadian dollar. In contrast, the dollar has tended to remain close to its lows against the yen and has even continued to depreciate against other Asian currencies over the past month. ", " In recent months, implied volatility in foreign exchange markets has remained at relatively elevated levels for some currencies, reflecting the large movements in currencies that have taken place. This stands in contrast to equity and fixed-interest markets where implied volatilities are close to their historical lows (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). ", " Expectations of a revaluation of the Chinese currency intensified in the closing months of last year but have since been scaled back somewhat. The 1-year non-deliverable forward (NDF) rate for the renminbi rose by 2½ per cent over November and December as officials stated China's commitment to flexibility in the exchange rate without confirming any timetable for regime change. However, the rate has declined modestly since then, as markets have assessed that a change is not imminent. With the recent scaling back of expectations, the probability attached to a revaluation is slightly lower than at the beginning of 2004. ", " Movements in the US dollar have been the major influence on the Australian dollar since the last <em>Statement</em>. The broad-based fall in the US dollar over the December quarter saw the Australian dollar reach US79.46 cents in late November, just below the recent cyclical high of US80.05 seen in February last year. In recent weeks, as the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> has stabilised, the Australian dollar has generally traded in a range between US76 and US79 cents. The Australian dollar has appreciated against most other major trading partners that float over the past few months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 15, Table 4)</span>. ", " As noted in previous <em>Statements</em>, offshore movements in the Australian dollar continue to dominate movements during the onshore trading session (Graph 16). In recent months this has reflected the large moves of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> against all currencies in the US trading session. ", " Market sentiment towards the Australian dollar remains positive. As the exchange rate appreciated through to late November, speculative positioning in Australian dollar futures on the Chicago Futures Exchange rose to record levels. While there has been a substantial scaling back in speculative short positions against the US currency in recent months, especially <span lang=\"fr\">vis-à-vis</span> the euro, there is little sign that long positions in the Australian dollar have been trimmed. Sentiment in the options market, as indicated by 1-month risk reversals (a measure derived from the relative prices of put and call options in the Australian dollar), has also become more bullish since mid 2004. In addition, continuing robust Uridashi issuance appears to have provided ongoing support for the Australian dollar, despite increased maturities of existing A$ Uridashi bonds. Monthly Uridashi issuance averaged $1.6 billion over the second half of 2004, in excess of its average for the previous three years. ", " As the Australian dollar appreciated against the US dollar in November, the Bank took the opportunity to add to net reserves through its transactions in the foreign exchange market. In November, $730 million were added to net reserves as a result of transactions. As the Australian dollar eased from its highs against the US dollar, the Bank has scaled back its purchases of foreign exchange in the market to a rate only a little above that sufficient to cover the requirements of the Government. Some of the addition to net reserves over the past three months that resulted from transactions and earnings were offset by valuation effects imparted by the appreciation in the exchange rate. As a result, net reserves rose only marginally, from $24.2 billion at the end of October to around $25 billion at the end of January. At the end of January holdings of foreign exchange under swaps were little changed at around $22 billion. ", " The US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of its three meetings since the last <em>Statement</em>. Since the beginning of its current tightening cycle in June 2004, the federal funds rate has been increased from 1.0 per cent to 2.5 per cent in increments of 25 basis points at each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Reflecting indications that US economic growth remains robust and concerns that inflationary pressures may be building, markets are now expecting the federal funds rate to reach 3¼ per cent by August, which implies 25 basis point increases at three of the next four <span class=\"no-wrap\">FOMC meetings (Graph 17)</span>. This is significantly higher than expected at the time of the last <em>Statement</em>, when futures markets expected that the federal funds rate would only be around 2½ per cent in the middle of 2005. ", " The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) are still not expected to raise interest rates for some time. Indeed, as expectations for economic growth have been scaled back somewhat in both regions over the past three months, markets have pushed back their expectation of the timing of the first tightening by both central banks. Futures markets are not expecting the ECB to raise interest rates from their current level of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span> until at least the end of 2005, while a tightening is not expected in Japan until at least 2006. ", " Other industrial country central banks have left interest rates unchanged over the past three months (Graph 18). After increasing their policy rates by 125 basis points and 150 basis points respectively in the current cycle, market participants expect that the tightening cycles in both the UK and New Zealand are close to an end, although in both cases, recent inflation data have caused some participants to revise that assessment. The Bank of Canada is expected to tighten further in the months ahead, with rates still relatively low at 2.5 per cent. In each of these countries, the decision to leave interest rates unchanged in part reflected an assessment of the potential impact of the appreciation of their exchange rates against the US dollar over 2004. ", " Monetary policy continued to be tightened in a number of emerging market countries, including Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Taiwan and Thailand, reflecting building inflationary concerns. In contrast, the Bank of Korea reduced interest rates by 25 basis points in November, for the second time in six months, reflecting continued weak domestic demand and a rising exchange rate. Policy rates were also lowered by 300 basis points in Turkey as inflation in that country continues to decline from high levels. ", " Yields on 10-year US government bonds have remained within a relatively narrow range around 4.2 per cent over the past three months. This is well below the high of 4.9 per cent seen in June 2004, despite the 150 basis point increase in the federal funds rate since then and signs that inflationary pressure may be building. In contrast to previous tightening episodes in the US, long-term yields have remained stable and even declined as the short-term rate has been increased (Graph 19). In previous episodes, long yields tended to rise in the early stages of a tightening cycle at least as much as the rise in short rates, reflecting inflation concerns. In part, the current situation is likely to reflect the increased credibility of the Federal Reserve in maintaining low and stable inflation, and may also be attributable to an improvement in communication by the Fed of its intentions. Offshore demand for US fixed-income investments, both from official and private sources, has also had a strong influence. ", " After trading in line with US yields for much of 2004, movements in European and Japanese government bond yields have decoupled from those in the US in recent months, largely reflecting the scaling back in the outlook for economic growth in both economies. German bond yields have declined over the past three months to be only slightly above the multi-decade lows seen in early 2003, while Japanese yields have also edged downward. The spread between US and German 10-year bond yields has widened to 60 basis points, its widest level since late <span class=\"no-wrap\">2000</span>, although the spread was considerably wider than this for much of the second half of the 1990s. ", " The continuing low level of government bond yields has supported the search for yield that has been evident over the past couple of years, with the spread between yields on US government debt and yields on both corporate and emerging market debt remaining around historical lows over the past three months (<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>). ", " After relatively lacklustre growth for the first three quarters of 2004 (with the notable exception of the Australian market), global equity markets rose strongly in the December quarter, in part reflecting renewed confidence about the strength of the economic recovery in the US (Graph 20, Table 5). The US S&amp;P 500 increased <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> in the quarter which accounted for all of the rise in the index over 2004, while the NASDAQ recorded a particularly strong increase of 15 per cent in the quarter. Broad-based equity indices in Japan and Europe also rose strongly in the December quarter, with the Euro STOXX up 8 per cent and the TOPIX up 4 per cent. ", " Emerging equity markets have also performed strongly in recent months. Average share prices rose 5 per cent in emerging Asia since the last <em>Statement</em>, with the strongest gains occurring in India, Indonesia and Thailand. Chinese shares fell 8 per cent amid some relatively poor earnings reports and continuing concerns about government actions to slow the economy. In Latin America, average share prices rose 7 per cent. ", " Growth in the Australian economy as reported in the national accounts slowed during 2004 from the rapid pace in the second half of 2003, as a result of a moderation in the pace of domestic demand growth and a continued drag on growth from subdued exports. GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.3 per cent in the September quarter, with growth over the year slowing to 3 per cent (Graph 21). Growth continued to be driven by domestic demand, with strong growth in consumption and public demand, moderate growth in business investment, but subtractions from dwelling investment and inventories. The most noteworthy impact on growth in the quarter, however, was the ¾ percentage point subtraction resulting from the decline in the net trade balance, as exports fell and imports rose slightly. ", " However, a range of other indicators suggested firmer conditions throughout 2004. Business confidence is at high levels and business profitability has been strong. Consumer confidence has been close to record levels, and the labour market continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate falling in December to its lowest level <span class=\"no-wrap\">since 1976</span>. This contrast between the relatively weak picture in the quarterly national accounts and the strong conditions suggested by most other indicators is somewhat unusual. ", " Household consumption remained strong in 2004, increasing by 5.4 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Disposable income grew strongly, outpacing growth in consumption over this period, such that the saving ratio rose. Solid employment growth and firm gains in wages and property income contributed to the growth in household income over the year. Disposable income was also boosted by the measures in the May 2004 Budget, particularly the lump-sum payments associated with the Family Tax Benefit and the income tax cuts from 1 July. ", " It appears that consumers have saved a larger-than-expected proportion of the proceeds of the fiscal stimulus. In the September quarter, household consumption rose by 1.1 per cent, a slight increase from the pace in the June quarter, but less than might have been expected given the boost to incomes from the budget measures. In addition, retail sales were weaker than expected in October and November (Graph 22). This weakness in spending may partly be explained by rises in petrol prices, which directly subtracted from the amount available for discretionary spending. Alternatively, it may be a reaction by some consumers to the slowing in household wealth resulting from the weakness in house prices. However, it is also possible that the recorded weakness in the retail trade survey reflects sampling variation, given that it was driven mainly by sales of smaller retailers, of which only a sample are surveyed. In contrast, the growth in sales of the fully enumerated larger retailers remained fairly firm. ", " It is important to note that the retail trade survey covers only around 40 per cent of consumer spending and that other recent indicators of consumption have been more positive. Even though the tariff cut on passenger vehicles in January 2005 appears to have encouraged some vehicle buyers to delay their purchases, motor vehicle sales increased a little in the December quarter, resulting in a record level of sales in 2004. Consumer sentiment also remains high, with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index rising in January to the second-highest level in the 30-year history of the survey. An expected continuation of positive labour market conditions and strong growth in household income, coupled with falling petrol prices and further scheduled tax cuts in July, also point to the pace of consumption growth remaining firm. ", " Growth in household assets moderated over the three quarters to the September quarter 2004 after growing rapidly over the preceding five years (Table 6). The slowing reflected the recent softness in dwelling prices, which was only partly offset by strong gains in financial assets. ", " At the same time, growth in credit provided to households remained strong, despite easing from the rapid pace seen in 2003. The ongoing accumulation of household debt has led to a further increase in the debt-servicing ratio; interest payments as a proportion of disposable income rose to 9.3 per cent in the September quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 23)</span>, and are expected to rise further. While this is an historically high level, at this stage the servicing burden does not appear to be constraining households, with indicators of financial stress – such as loan arrears – remaining low. The recent rise in the debt-servicing ratio is largely a result of households increasing their debt levels, rather than an unexpected sharp rise in interest rates, as occurred in the late 1980s. ", " The September quarter national accounts showed a small fall in dwelling investment in the quarter, suggesting that the downturn foreshadowed by leading indicators of housing construction is now under way. Building approvals fell by more than 15 per cent over the year to the December quarter, with similar falls recorded in approvals for both houses and medium-density housing (Graph 24). The value of approvals for alterations and additions fell by 5½ per cent over the same period. Other forward indicators, including display home traffic and land sales, also remain subdued; despite rising in November, the Housing Industry Association series on commitments to build remains 21 per cent below its peak in 2003. Sales of inner-city apartments are showing more pronounced weakness because of low investor interest. ", " The downturn in dwelling investment that appears to be in train is likely to be mild by historical standards. While the fall in medium-density building approvals from their peak is within the range of previous experience, the fall in approvals for houses, which make up the bulk of dwelling investment, has not been as rapid or as large to date as those observed in previous cycles. Furthermore, underlying demand is at a relatively high level and employment conditions remain favourable. Work yet to be done also remains at a high level and the continued growth in the average value of new dwellings is likely to temper further the expected fall in new dwelling investment. ", " Demand for housing finance now appears to have stopped falling after the declines earlier in 2004, and there are some tentative signs that it is starting to pick up. After being broadly flat for several months at a little above <span class=\"no-wrap\">$12 billion per month</span>, housing loan approvals rose by about 5 per cent in November. Over the six months to December, housing credit grew at an annualised rate of 12½ per cent, down from 22½ per cent over the second half of 2003. Within the total, investor loan approvals and credit have slowed much more than the owner-occupier components. After peaking in late 2003 at close to double the rate of growth in owner-occupier credit, the growth rate of investor credit is now similar to that for owner-occupier housing credit. ", " Following weak conditions in housing markets during the first three quarters of 2004, there is some evidence that median house prices rose moderately in the December quarter, though this may have largely reflected seasonal composition effects, which have tended to boost median price measures in the December quarter in previous years. The available data suggest nationwide average prices remained lower than a year earlier, driven by weakness in Sydney and Melbourne (Graph 25 and Table 7). As is usual, there is a wide range of estimates of average price changes, and most measures are subject to revision. The strongest estimates for the change in the December quarter are from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), based on CBA housing loans to owner-occupiers, but this measure has shown the greatest swings over the past few years. The weakest estimates are from <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian Property Monitors (APM)</span>, based on land titles offices' records, but these are likely to be revised upwards as more sales are reported to state governments. Nationwide apartment prices also appear to have risen modestly in the December quarter. ", " Business conditions remain favourable overall, with high profitability and strong sentiment supporting solid investment intentions. Conditions remain strongest in domestically oriented industries, with ongoing strength in retail trade and business services more than offsetting weaker construction activity in the September quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 26)</span>. In contrast, the recovery in trade-exposed industries is yet to generate sustained momentum despite the ongoing global economic expansion and favourable terms of trade. ", " More recently, most business surveys have reported buoyant levels of activity and confidence, consistent with strong growth in domestic demand and the significant improvement in the terms of trade over the past year, though exports are an area of relative weakness in survey responses. The NAB survey of the non-farm sector reported that business conditions strengthened in the December quarter from an already high level, underpinned by buoyant levels of sales, employment and profitability. Forward orders increased firmly and capacity utilisation rose to around previous peaks, though exports remained relatively subdued. The high level of business conditions was broadly based across most industries, with particular strength in the mining and non-residential construction sectors. Conditions were expected to remain positive over the next twelve months, with high levels of employment and output. The December quarter ACCI Survey of Investor Confidence, which also covers the non-farm sector, reported a high level of current and expected business conditions. ", " The ACCI-Westpac survey for the December quarter pointed to strong business conditions in the manufacturing sector. The composite index of activity and the measure of capacity utilisation both rose strongly to be close to previous peaks. The AIG's Performance of Manufacturing Index, a summary measure of activity in the manufacturing sector was also above its long-run average level in January. The Sensis Business Index reported favourable conditions among small and medium businesses, with confidence about the coming 12 months remaining near an historic high. ", " Despite easing slightly in the September quarter, corporate profitability remains strong, with the gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations almost 9½ per cent higher over the year. Forward-looking indicators suggest that the softness in corporate profits in the September quarter may be transitory. The NAB survey measure of actual profitability reached record levels in the months of October and November and remained high in December. After little growth in the first half of 2004, profits of unincorporated enterprises grew strongly in the September quarter, driven by a strong rise in farm profits. ", " The upswing in business investment seen over the past three years continued in the September quarter, with expenditure rising by 1.2 per cent (Graph 27). Growth in the quarter was again driven by a sharp increase in spending on machinery &amp; equipment. In contrast, non-residential construction recorded a large decline, reflecting falls in both the building and engineering components. The fall in the building component was quite pronounced, as had been signalled by the shift down in the volume of work approved in late 2003 and early 2004. ", " The outlook for business investment remains positive, supported by high levels of capacity utilisation and profitability. The latest capital expenditure (Capex) survey continues to point to solid growth in business investment in 2004/05, concentrated in the manufacturing, mining and property &amp; business services sectors. The strong growth in planned expenditure in the manufacturing sector is consistent with a large value of <span class=\"no-wrap\">resource-related</span> manufacturing projects scheduled for commencement in 2004/05. When adjusted by a five-year average realisation ratio, investment intentions suggest moderate growth in expenditure on machinery &amp; equipment. The outlook for investment expenditure on non-residential construction appears stronger overall. Activity is expected to be supported by a return to growth in engineering construction, reflecting the large value of resource-related work due to commence in 2004/05. This is expected to be partly offset by weakness in non-residential building activity, given the weakness in approvals seen in late 2003 and early 2004. The September quarter Rabobank survey suggests that farm equipment investment intentions, which are not covered in the Capex survey, remain at a high level, despite a slight decline in reported confidence in the farm sector. ", " Businesses' financing decisions are also consistent with the positive outlook for investment. On top of the high levels of profits and hence available internal funds, external funding seems to have picked up. Over the year to December, business credit grew by 8.7 per cent and outstanding non-intermediated debt increased by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">19 per cent</span>. Similarly, after a period of subdued growth in early 2004, net equity raisings in the December quarter were above their average of the past five years. ", " The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) for 2004/05, released in December, provided a further update of the Australian Government budget position from the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO) in September. The projected underlying cash surplus for 2004/05 has been revised up considerably since the May Budget (Graph 28). This largely reflects a substantial upward revision to expected taxation revenue from individuals and companies, consistent with continued strength in employment and profits in early 2004/05. This upward revision to revenue was slightly offset by an increase in expected expenditure, reflecting new policy measures announced since the Budget. These new expenditure measures have resulted in the projected underlying cash surplus being revised down modestly from 2005/06 onwards. ", " Labour market conditions continued to improve in the December quarter. Employment grew by 1.2 per cent in the quarter, which is well above trend growth. Employment was 2.6 per cent higher over the year, and full-time employment accounted for almost three-quarters of the total increase (Graph 29). This strength in employment is somewhat at odds with the relatively weak rate of growth indicated by the national accounts. ", " The buoyant labour market conditions in the December quarter were reflected in a further decline in the unemployment rate, which fell to 5.1 per cent in the month of December, to be 0.7 percentage points lower over 2004. This is the lowest rate recorded since late 1976. A measure of the underemployment rate, which includes employed people who want to work more hours, also reached a new low point of 6.4 per cent, a rate last seen in the December quarter 1989.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> The participation rate increased to be 63¾ per cent in the December quarter, which is ¼ percentage point above its recent average levels. ", " The differences in labour market performance by state noted in the last <em>Statement</em> persisted in the December quarter. In New South Wales, which accounts for one-third of employment, employment growth slowed to less than 1 per cent over the year to the December quarter. All other states experienced above-trend employment growth over this period, most notably Queensland. Unemployment rates declined over 2004 in all states except Victoria. The most significant falls were recorded in Western Australia and Queensland, which now have unemployment rates of 4.5 and 4.7 per cent. By industry, the largest contributions to employment growth over the year continued to come from household services (including health &amp; community services, accommodation, cafes &amp; restaurants and cultural &amp; recreational services), construction and manufacturing. ", " The strength in the labour market is also apparent in liaison reports, which indicate strong demand for labour and shortages of skilled workers in a range of industries and sectors, from construction and engineering to accounting and information technology. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand point to further solid employment growth in the near term (Graph 30). The ABS measure of job vacancies has continued to grow strongly, as have various internet-based vacancy series. Surveys of businesses' hiring intentions are at high levels, and print-based vacancy measures have been growing in line with the above-average growth in the labour force. ", " Growth in Australia's export volumes has remained weak over the past year or so, despite strong growth in global demand and world commodity prices, with total exports virtually unchanged from four years ago (Graph 31). In contrast, import volumes have expanded rapidly, buoyed by strength in domestic demand and price falls induced by a stronger exchange rate, though growth has begun to moderate more recently. A surge in Australia's terms of trade has mitigated the effect of these developments on the trade deficit, which is estimated to have been around 3¼ per cent of GDP in the December quarter 2004, wider than at mid year but broadly similar to the outturns of the past year and a half (Graph 32). The current account deficit also widened in the second half of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2004</span>, in part reflecting a sharp increase in the net income deficit in the September quarter. The current account deficit appears likely to have remained around record levels in the December quarter at close to 6¾ per cent of GDP (assuming that the net income deficit has remained constant as a share of GDP). ", " Export earnings increased by almost 15 per cent over the year to the September quarter, owing to strength in resource export prices, the recovery of rural export volumes from the drought and a pick-up in services exports following the SARS outbreak early in 2003. The pace of growth in export earnings moderated in the September quarter, however, weighed down by a broad-based fall in export volumes of 3¼ per cent. More recently, export earnings posted another modest gain in the December quarter, though with export prices declining largely on account of a stronger exchange rate in the quarter, export volumes appear to have risen. ", " Rural export earnings increased strongly over the year to mid 2004, as export volumes recovered from the trough associated with the drought. The upturn now appears to have run its course, with both the value and volume of rural exports falling in the September quarter (Graph 33). Furthermore, the value of rural exports fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> in the December quarter, implying another substantial fall in rural export volumes. Looking forward, there appears to be little prospect of near-term growth in cereals exports, given the estimated 19 per cent fall in the 2004/05 winter crop to around average levels. The outlook for livestock-based exports is more favourable, with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) expecting an increase in export volumes in 2004/05. While the outlook for beef exports is positive, some downside risk stems from uncertainty about the timing and extent of the re-entry of US beef exports into the Japanese market, following the recent conditional lifting of BSE-related restrictions on US beef in Japan. ", " The value of resource exports has increased sharply over the past year or so, largely because of a steep rise in commodity prices. In contrast, export volumes decreased over this period, despite strong global demand, as capacity and infrastructure constraints and supply disruptions restricted growth; such supply-side factors have hampered exports for a number of years, with resource export volumes now lower than during 2000 (see the chapter entitled ‘<a href=\"#are\">Australia's Resource Exports – Recent Trends                          and Prospects</a>’ in this <em>Statement</em>). Receipts from resource exports continued to rise rapidly in the December quarter; the estimated small fall in prices in Australian dollar terms points to a strong rise in resource export volumes, which would be the first increase since the December quarter 2003. This suggests that the completion of a number of mineral and energy projects is beginning to lead to higher production and exports. As noted in the next chapter, the outlook for resource exports over the next few years remains positive. Liaison reports suggest that constraints on resource exports are being alleviated as new production and transport capacity is brought on line in response to strong global demand. Ports data indicate that capacity expansions resulted in a sharp pick-up in iron ore and LNG export volumes in the December quarter; the latter pick-up reflects the recent commencement of the fourth LNG train at the <span class=\"no-wrap\">North West</span> Shelf gas project. ", " After a large fall in the December quarter 2003, manufactured export earnings trended upwards over 2004. The value of manufactured exports rose by 3½ per cent in the December quarter, and with a stronger Australian dollar exerting downward pressure on prices in the quarter, volumes look to have increased solidly. Nevertheless, growth in manufactured export volumes has been lacklustre since 2000. Although trading partner growth has recently been strong, firms continue to cite intense competition in export markets and the high level of the exchange rate as impediments to growth in manufactured exports. While manufactured exports from other industrialised nations have picked up since mid 2003 in response to the recovery in global demand, their overall performance since 2000 has also been quite weak, especially compared with the experience of the 1990s (Table 8). This suggests that the recent Australian experience is not altogether unusual, and may highlight a broader shift in manufacturing to developing countries such as China. ", " The value of services exports has fallen over the past year. This has been driven by lower export volumes, including an apparent fall in the second half of 2004 despite a firm upward trend in short-term visitor arrivals. Nevertheless, the outlook for services exports remains positive, given recent higher hotel occupancy and room rates and upbeat assessments by industry bodies of tourism prospects. ", " Following a surge around the beginning of 2004, which saw year-ended growth of 15 per cent, growth in import volumes eased, with imports rising by about 1 per cent in the September quarter and by an estimated 3 per cent in the December quarter. The moderation in imports growth over the second half of 2004 appears to reflect the recent decline in domestic demand growth to more sustainable rates. Capital goods imports rose by 2½ per cent in the September quarter to be 22 per cent higher over the year. And despite falls in both the June and September quarters, services imports remained 7 per cent higher over the year to the September quarter, owing to a surge in international travel by Australians in late 2003. ", " The net income deficit increased by about one-third over the year to the September quarter 2004, to $7.2 billion, and is running at its highest share of GDP since 1997. The widening in the net income deficit reflected increased interest payments to foreign holders of Australian debt and increased dividend payments on foreign holdings of Australian equity. The rise in payments on debt is consistent with the growth in the stock of Australian foreign debt, while the increase in payments on equity coincides with a period of strong growth in Australian corporate profitability. ", " Commodity prices have changed little on average over recent months and remain at high levels; the RBA Index of Commodity Prices fell by 0.8 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to January to be 10.2 per cent higher over the year. While rural and base metals prices were broadly unchanged over the three months to January, the prices of ‘other resources’ fell modestly (Graph 34). Commodity prices in Australian dollar terms fell by 1.9 per cent over the same period, though they also remain at high levels. ", " Rural prices fell marginally over the three months to January as strength in beef prices, underpinned by increased demand, was offset by lower prices for wheat and cotton, owing to recent and prospective increases in global supply. Beef prices rose to very high levels in 2004, supported by Japan's decision to ban imports of US beef following the detection of a case of BSE in the United States in late 2003. Japan has since agreed to lift the ban and allow imports of US beef from cattle that are under two years old, which is likely to place downward pressure on prices over the coming year, though it may take some time for the United States to establish systems to identify cattle age accurately. ", " Base metals prices were broadly unchanged over the three months to January, and at 11.2 per cent higher over the past year, they remain around the highest levels seen since 1990. Zinc prices rose by 13 per cent over the three months to January, as stronger-than-expected demand led to falls in stocks. ", " Prices of other resources have risen by 22 per cent over the past year, but fell by 1.3 per cent over the three months to January. Coking coal and iron ore prices, which are mostly fixed in US dollars, fell in SDR terms as the US dollar depreciated late last year. The price of gold fell by 2.4 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to January, with a sharp decline in January. Partly offsetting these falls was a rise in alumina prices as a consequence of strong aluminium demand, particularly in China, and global supply constraints, including in Jamaica following Hurricane Ivan in late 2004. ", " Negotiations for coal and iron ore contract prices for 2005/06 have commenced, and further large rises are expected following the steep increases in 2004/05. Some coking coal contracts have reportedly been settled at prices more than double current contract price levels. Ongoing strength in steel demand has contributed to a considerable tightening of the coking coal market. Steaming coal contract prices, which rose by over 60 per cent in US dollar terms in 2004, are expected to increase by at least another 20 per cent in the coming year. Iron ore contract price negotiations have also commenced, and price increases of over 50 per cent are possible given the current strength of global steel demand. ", " The terms of trade rose by 2.3 per cent in the September quarter 2004, to reach a 30-year high, and are likely to have increased again in the December quarter (Graph 35). Export prices in SDR terms have risen sharply over the past two years, buoyed by the steep rise in global commodity prices, while import prices have remained broadly flat, reflecting competitive pressures in global manufacturing. The terms of trade should increase further in <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 2005</span> when the anticipated higher 2005/06 contract prices for bulk commodities take effect. ", " After strong growth through the 1990s, resource exports have flattened out and then declined in the period since 2000. With resource exports accounting for around one-third of Australia's exports, this subdued performance has been a key contributor to the weakness in overall exports seen so far this decade. Weak world growth in the early part of the decade played an important role in reducing the demand for Australia's non-resource exports. In contrast, and as noted in the August 2004 <em>Statement</em>, the underperformance of resource exports since 2000 owes more to developments on the supply side. This chapter examines recent trends in Australia's resource exports, discusses the associated capacity constraints, and considers the prospects for growth. ", " The weak export performance seen since 2000 has reflected subdued performance in all major categories of exports. However, some of the weakest outcomes have occurred in the case of resource exports, which declined over the year to the September quarter to be below the level reached in 2000, compared with average annual growth of around 6½ per cent in the 1990s (Table 9, Graph 36). The pronounced slowing in aggregate resource exports has masked diverging trends among the various components (Graph 37). The largest components – metal ores &amp; minerals (such as iron ore and alumina) and coal, coke &amp; briquettes (including coking and thermal coal) – have continued to increase over the past four years at similar rates to those seen during the 1990s. The weakness in resource exports has thus been concentrated in the remaining components, particularly exports of ‘other mineral fuels’ (which includes LNG and crude oil) and metals (which includes aluminium, iron &amp; steel and copper), with exports of gold also trending lower.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> ", " The weak performance of resource exports has continued over the past two years despite the sharp increase in global growth over 2003–2004, which has seen strong demand for resources and a surge in commodity prices. This suggests that the weakness in resource exports mainly reflects a lack of growth in aggregate supply capacity. Given the long lead times involved in putting new capacity in place, the current capacity shortfalls are primarily the result of earlier decisions, most notably the sharp downturn in investment in the mining sector in the late 1990s <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 38)</span>. Moreover, a number of specific factors have contributed to a decline in supply capacity for categories where exports have actually fallen: ", " Although there has been reasonable growth in the other two resource export components, particularly for iron ore, alumina and coal, the growth in these items has not been sufficient to compensate for the weakness in those components where production has fallen significantly. And even in the stronger performing components, supply constraints, including much-publicised capacity constraints in rail and port infrastructure, have begun to hamper export growth. These constraints have not played a major role in the overall weakness in resource exports so far this decade, though they have restricted the industry's ability to respond to the recent surge in world demand. ", " Weak commodity prices in the late 1990s, together with consolidation in the global mining industry, appear also to have caused a global downturn in mining investment around that time; total resource-related investment in the US, Canada and South Africa declined (and was relatively flat in China), though the downturn was much less pronounced than in Australia. The resulting restraint on growth in global capacity is likely to have contributed to the recent surge in world prices for commodities as global demand has strengthened. Further, the sharp turnaround in mining investment in Australia since 2000 (discussed below) appears also to have been matched elsewhere around the world, particularly in the US and China. This points to a significant expansion in global capacity in coming years, and the possibility that recent large commodity price increases may be partly reversed as global supply expands. ", " In line with the sharper downturn in mining investment, growth in Australia's resource exports has generally lagged behind that of other large commodity exporters in recent years (Graph 39). The value of mineral exports from six major exporters grew by 76 per cent in US dollar terms between 1999 and 2003, compared with growth of 34 per cent for Australia over the same period. However, consistent with the data in Table 9, this relative underperformance appears to be confined to only a few types of commodities. In particular, Australia has generally not lost market share in global trade for our major resource export commodities (Graph 40). However, the decline in Australia's share of global crude oil production has been pronounced, and is expected to continue, with the share of global gold and copper production also generally declining over recent years. ", " Following the downturn in the late 1990s, mining investment in Australia has increased substantially (refer <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 38)</span>. This was initially spurred by a sharp lift in Australian dollar commodity prices and mining profits, buoyed in part by a large depreciation in the exchange rate. The resurgence in global demand and world commodity prices from 2003 has since provided further impetus to resource-related investment. Given the long lead times for resource projects, this earlier investment is expected to result in significant expansions in mining capacity in the current financial year and in 2005/06. Data from Access Economics indicate that the value of completed resource projects is set to rise significantly in 2004/05, and remain relatively high in 2005/06, reflecting large increases across a range of commodities (Graph 41).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"r6\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 6\">[6]</a></sup> ", " In addition, a detailed survey of impending capacity expansions across 14 commodity groups paints a similar picture of substantial growth in capacity over the next few years. This exercise, as summarised in Table 10, is based on information from ABARE, Access Economics and various company sources. Although there is substantial uncertainty over the timing and size of expansions, the analysis suggests that new capacity coming on stream between <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 2004 and 2007</span> would imply an increase in overall production of around 28 per cent from the levels of 2003/04, corresponding to annual growth of about 9 per cent. While solid growth is expected in each of the next three years, the most significant increase in capacity is expected to occur in 2005/06. The actual increase in capacity that occurs over this period will also be affected by cancellations of some planned projects, the addition of new projects that are in preliminary stages of planning or not yet planned, and most importantly, on the loss of some existing capacity from closures owing to low profitability or depletion of resources. Accordingly, the net increase in capacity appears likely to be less than that implied by Table 10. While there is considerable uncertainty around any particular estimate, the analysis nevertheless suggests that substantial growth in mining capacity and resource export volumes is in prospect for at least the next few years. ", " In the case of those commodities where there has been reasonable growth in recent years, there would appear to be good prospects for further increases in production and exports. For example, there should be substantial new capacity, with limited declines in existing capacity, for several major export commodities, including coal, iron ore, alumina and especially LNG, with growth in the latter significantly boosting exports in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">December quarter 2004</span>. ", " Furthermore, there would appear to be some increases in production in prospect for the commodity groups that have contributed most to export weakness in recent years. In the case of gold and other metals, new capacity is expected to come on stream in the near future, and a number of temporary problems that have restrained production are likely to have been resolved, or be nearing resolution. In addition, given the strength of global demand and commodity prices, mine or plant closures are expected to be fairly limited, with ABARE in fact predicting that some closed mining and refining operations will be re-opened in response to the current favourable conditions. In the case of crude oil &amp; condensates, it is expected that significant new capacity will come on stream over the next two years or so, and that this will initially outweigh declines in production from existing oilfields. However, the underlying constraints in oil reserves are expected to re-emerge after a few years, with both ABARE and Geoscience Australia expecting oil production to decline again after 2007. ", " The ability to expand exports will depend not only on production capacity, but also on the capacity of rail and port infrastructure. Over the past year, concerns have emerged that a lack of capacity in transport infrastructure is constraining the ability of the resources industry to expand export supply. Transport infrastructure constraints are primarily an issue for bulk commodities such as coal and metal ores; the volume of these commodities transported is large compared with processed minerals, and strong growth in recent years has stretched existing transport capacity. Exports of processed metals do not place a large burden on domestic port and rail capacity, while oil and LNG are usually exported from the fields directly. ", " Expansion of export supply capacity for bulk resources requires coordinated investment in transport infrastructure as well as mine capacity. Data from Access Economics suggest some increase is under way in overall investment spending on rail and port projects. However, it is difficult to ascertain directly from these data if this will alleviate specific capacity constraints in bulk export supply chains. ", " To examine transport infrastructure developments more closely, a detailed survey of the infrastructure associated with major coal and iron ore ports was undertaken. Overall, the analysis, which is summarised in Table 11, suggests that transport bottlenecks have hampered growth in these stronger performing export categories over the past year. However, investment in additional infrastructure is occurring, with the planned expansions likely to support strong growth in iron ore exports, while growth in coal exports is expected to be more moderate. ", " In the case of coal, while the capacity of port and rail infrastructure has become stretched with the latest surge in global demand, the industry has been expanding transport capacity steadily over recent years. Since 2000, the capacity of coal export ports is estimated to have increased by around 19 per cent, with expansions occurring at the Hay Point, Newcastle and Gladstone ports, which together account for over 90 per cent of Australia's coal exports. However, the Newcastle port operator's decision to introduce a quota system to allocate transport chain capacity and reduce the ship queue is one illustration that provides clear evidence that a shortage of transport capacity is limiting the industry's ability to meet strong growth in coal demand. In the case of Newcastle, exports are running below port capacity and bottlenecks appear to be concentrated in the rail network. For the two major Queensland supply chains, the ports are operating close to capacity and investment in both port and rail facilities is necessary to allow export growth. ", " According to currently available information on planned coal port expansions, committed investment will increase port capacity by an estimated 13 per cent over the next two years or so. Growth in rail capacity is expected to be broadly in line with the expansion of port capacity. However, this is unlikely to match the expansion in production potential or export demand, so transport capacity is likely to remain a constraint on export supply, at least until a number of proposed large infrastructure projects are completed later in the decade. For example, a significant increase in the capacity of the Hunter Valley coal chain is unlikely until completion of major rail infrastructure projects to eliminate the bottleneck at the intersection of the coal and commuter networks. In Queensland, as discussed below, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding a proposed expansion of the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal at Hay Point. ", " One feature hindering investment in both the NSW and Queensland coal industries is the fragmented ownership of the supply-chain assets; a large number of mines share mostly state-government-owned rail and port infrastructure. Transport infrastructure is generally operated not by the coal mining companies, but by public or privately owned third parties who are responsible for new investment, some of which are subject to regulatory control owing to the monopolistic nature of the assets. In the case of Dalrymple Bay, a major longer-term expansion of capacity is uncertain given that it has been reported that investment in new capacity is contingent on an increase in the allowable user charge, whereas the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA) has proposed that user charges be lowered. The operator has deferred a decision on further investment until the QCA hands down its final ruling in April. ", " In the case of iron ore, there are fewer coordination problems, as the industry is more concentrated, with two companies controlling three vertically integrated supply chains accounting for over 90 per cent of exports. The consolidated structure of the iron ore industry, and geographic separation from competing economic activities, appear to have facilitated a rapid pick-up in transport capacity in response to strong global demand and prices. Accelerated investment in ship-loading and rail capacity has been undertaken over the past year to match expanding iron ore production. Port capacity is estimated to have increased by 19 per cent since 2003, more than sufficient to support recent growth in iron ore exports. Company announcements suggest that another <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> increase in transport capacity will come on line in the next two years, with further substantial expansion planned for later in the decade. ", " Beyond the reasonably favourable outlook for the next few years, growth in productive capacity and exports in the resources sector over the longer term will depend on future mineral discoveries (though existing reserves could support production and exports of some commodities, such as coal, for a considerable time). However, developments in exploration expenditures are not especially encouraging. Although there has been a modest pick-up recently, levels of spending on mineral and petroleum exploration are both below the peaks seen in 1997, and indeed as a percentage of GDP are currently around the lowest levels seen for at least 25 years (Graph 42). This suggests that growth in Australian resource production and exports over the longer term could be at risk without an ongoing lift in exploration spending. ", " There is some evidence that weakness in Australian exploration in recent years has mirrored global trends. Data from sources such as the Metals Economics Group (MEG) in Canada and Price Water house Coopers suggest that global spending on exploration has been relatively weak in recent years, following a sharp fall in the late 1990s. Indications are that global exploration spending is now beginning to recover, in line with the Australian experience, though it appears to have outstripped the relatively muted rise in exploration expenditure in Australia to date. ", " The current strength in aggregate investment in resources suggests that a sustained pick-up in Australia's resource production and exports is likely, a conclusion supported by a detailed analysis of planned increases in production capacity for 14 major export commodities. The implied increase in overall resources production over the next three years, if realised, would facilitate resource export growth over the next few years at about the same pace as seen in the 1980s and 1990s. In the case of the bulk commodities, growth in exports will require substantial growth in rail and port capacity, much of which is under way or committed. However, in the case of coal, major increases in export capacity will require better coordination between producers, infrastructure operators and governments, especially in respect of the financing and pricing of new transport infrastructure. ", " Finally, it is worth considering the broader implications if Australia and other major resource exporters are successful in easing capacity constraints and in increasing export volumes. In particular, it is likely that the recent sharp increases in commodity prices – the steep rises in coal and iron ore prices being the most noteworthy cases – would not be sustained if global supply was increased substantially. The consolidation of the global resources industry may help to reduce the ‘cobweb cycles’ (or ‘hog cycles’) that periodically occur in commodity markets, but they are unlikely to eliminate such cycles entirely. Thus it would seem quite possible that at some stage in the next few years, there could be some retracement of the current strength in resource commodity prices and Australia's terms of trade. ", " For a time following the previous <em>Statement</em>, short-term market yields in Australia fell. This was mainly in response to a number of weaker-than-expected data releases, including the GDP figures. More recently, however, yields have been rising again, as the run of economic data has been of a stronger tone (Graph 43). Yields rose further in late January after the release of the CPI statistics, which showed that inflation was higher than most market participants expected. Short-term yields have risen by about 15 basis points from their December quarter lows, as the market has again moved to price in a possible monetary tightening, though not in the immediate future. ", " Long-term yields have followed a pattern similar to that in short-term yields. From around 5.4 per cent at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>, yields on 10-year bonds fell to a low of 5.1 per cent in mid December, but have since risen back to near 5.4 per cent. These swings in bond yields were for the most part driven by domestic news rather than international events. In fact, for much of the period when Australian bond yields were falling, US yields were rising. This led to quite a sharp narrowing in the spread in bond yields between the two countries, from around 130 basis points at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> to a low of 85 basis points in early December. Since then, the spread has returned to around 120 basis points. ", " There has been little change in the market's perceptions of credit risk during the past three months. Spreads between corporate bond yields and swap rates and the premia on credit default swaps have fallen slightly over the period, and are very low by historical standards (Graph 44). While the low level of credit spreads in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australia (and in other major bond markets)</span> largely reflects favourable trading conditions for corporates, there is evidence that the search for yield has been a contributing factor. In Australia, this has been evidenced by institutional investors having greater-than-index weight exposure to non-government bonds. Australian retail investors have also increased their (effective) exposure to corporate debt, via the purchase of listed, synthetic collateralised debt obligations (CDOs).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"r7\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 7\">[7]</a></sup> ", " Intermediaries' variable indicator lending rates are unchanged since the previous <em>Statement</em>, consistent with there having been no change in the cash rate. Interest rates on fixed-rate housing loans have fallen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 basis points</span> over the same period, bringing the cumulative decline since late September 2004 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">35 basis points</span> (Graph 45, Table 12). The major banks' average 3-year fixed housing rate is currently <span class=\"no-wrap\">6.60 per cent</span>, 45 basis points below their average standard variable rate. This widening in the gap between fixed and variable housing rates is likely to have contributed to the pick-up in the proportion of borrowers choosing to take out fixed-rate housing loans: in November 2004, the latest available data, 11 per cent of new <span class=\"no-wrap\">owner-occupier</span> housing loan approvals were at fixed rates, up from 7 per cent three months earlier and the highest share since the beginning of 2004, which followed a period of monetary policy tightening (Graph 45). ", " Fixed rates on loans to small businesses have been broadly unchanged in net terms since the previous <em>Statement</em>, having fallen by 15 basis points in total since around the middle of 2004. The movements in fixed housing and small business lending rates over this period have been broadly consistent with the movements in banks' costs of funding these loans. ", " Australian share prices have risen by 10 per cent since the previous <em>Statement</em> and reached a series of record highs during the period (Graph 46). The Australian market continued to outperform the S&amp;P 500 and MSCI World indices, which both rose by about 6 per cent. The ASX 200 rose by 23 per cent over 2004, the largest calendar-year increase since 1993 and more than double the rise in the S&amp;P 500 and MSCI World indices over the year. ", " The increase in the ASX 200 since the previous <em>Statement</em> has been broad-based, with all 10 market sectors and three-quarters of individual companies' share prices having risen (Graph 47). The materials sector has risen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span>, boosted by continuing strength in base metals prices and expectations of substantial increases in contract prices for coal and iron ore. The industrials sector (up 13 per cent) and consumer staples sector <span class=\"no-wrap\">(up 7 per cent)</span> have been supported by significant merger and acquisition activity. ", " In aggregate, the rise in share prices since the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> has outstripped growth in dividends and earnings. Dividend yields have fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 3.4 per cent, having been around 4 per cent a year earlier, and the price/earnings (P/E) ratio has risen from 19 to 21, compared with a 40-year average of around 15 (Graph 48). The 12-month forward P/E ratio has also risen, despite some upward revision to earnings forecasts. ", " Margin lending for direct purchases of equities and placements with managed funds rose by 5 per cent in the December quarter, to $15.2 billion. Growth over the year was 21 per cent, up from 15 per cent over the previous year. Much of the recent growth in margin debt has reflected an increase in the average loan size, which has risen by around $13,000 to $107,000 over the past year. Average leverage is still relatively low, however, mainly owing to the strength in the share market, which has boosted the value of assets underlying margin loans. ", " Australian non-government entities issued $28 billion of bonds in the December quarter, well below the $42 billion average issuance seen in the first three quarters of 2004 (Table 13). The slowdown in the December quarter was evident mainly in offshore markets. ", " Asset-backed vehicles issued only $4 billion of bonds in the December quarter, less than a quarter of their average issuance in the first three quarters of 2004. The decline in issuance was sharper than can be readily explained by seasonality and the fall in housing loan approvals in 2004 and appears to have been driven by a fall in issuer supply rather than investor demand, given that primary spreads have narrowed by at least 5 basis points over the period, to historically low levels. Issuance was robust in January but market contacts don't expect issuance in 2005 to be as strong as that seen in 2004. ", " Financial institutions' bond issuance was also weaker in the December quarter, particularly issuance in offshore markets. In contrast, non-financial corporates, led by property trust and infrastructure companies, issued a record $10 billion of bonds. ", " Non-residents issued $10 billion of Australian-dollar denominated debt in the December quarter. Foreign financial institutions led the issuance in Australia, while supranationals and foreign government agencies accounted for most of the offshore Australian dollar issuance. ", " Total issuance of bonds in the domestic market by all non-government borrowers was $68 billion in 2004, up <span class=\"no-wrap\">60 per cent</span> on 2003, with half of this increase accounted for by increased issuance by non-residents. This strength in gross issuance has led to a sharp increase in non-government bond outstandings. Over the year, non-government bond outstandings rose by $34 billion to $176 billion. The Commonwealth Government's bond outstandings were little changed at $52 billion, while the state governments' bond outstandings rose slightly to <span class=\"no-wrap\">$56 billion (Graph 49)</span>. Non-government bonds presently account for around 60 per cent of domestic bond outstandings, compared with only 14 per cent a decade ago. ", " Australian entities' issuance of hybrid securities picked up in the second half of 2004 after slowing noticeably during the first half because of issuer uncertainty about how hybrid securities would be classified under new accounting standards. Since the previous <em>Statement</em>, non-financial and financial institutions have each issued almost $1½ billion of hybrid securities. Financial institutions continue to be the main driver of innovation in the market. IAG issued the first reset-exchangeable security in the domestic market. (These are reset securities combined with an option that allows the issuer to convert the securities to preference shares but subsequently pay a higher coupon rate if not converted to ordinary equity or redeemed within 10 years.) Also, ANZ became the first Australian entity to issue a euro-denominated hybrid while Rabobank became the first non-resident issuer of hybrid securities in the domestic market. ", " Net equity raisings totalled $7.8 billion in the December quarter, about one and a half times the quarterly average since the start of 2000 (Graph 50). Equity raisings via initial public offerings (IPOs) were particularly strong, with <span class=\"no-wrap\">53 companies</span> raising in excess of $3 billion in total (compared with around $1 billion per quarter, on average, since the start of 2000). Companies in the financials and industrials sectors accounted for almost two-thirds of the value of IPO capital raised. The large amount of equity raised was offset to some extent by a sharp increase in the value of buybacks in the quarter. This result was driven by BHP Billiton's and Telstra's buybacks in December. ", " For non-financial corporates, total net non-intermediated capital raisings (that is, issuance of short and long-term debt securities, hybrids and equities, all net of maturities/buybacks) reached record levels in the December quarter. For the second half of the year, net raisings amounted to $23 billion, around double the half-yearly average since 2000. ", " Merger and acquisition activity by Australian companies remained strong in the December quarter. In <span class=\"no-wrap\">the second half of 2004</span> there were almost $50 billion of completed and pending transactions (Graph 51). This was well above the $36 billion recorded in the first half of 2004, which included the $27 billion Westfield merger, and more than triple the semi-annual average since 1995. Market participants have attributed the increase in merger and acquisition activity to rising equity prices, strong company profitability and a strong economy, both domestically and globally. ", " Financial conditions continue, on balance, to be supportive of domestic economic growth. Both nominal and real interest rates are marginally below their average levels of the past decade. The real exchange rate has appreciated in recent months, but the strong terms of trade are likely to have offset its contractionary effects. There have also been strong gains in equity markets during 2004 and total credit growth still remains relatively strong. ", " The cash rate has remained at 5.25 per cent for over twelve months. Household and business variable lending rates have also remained constant, and below their averages of the past decade. In addition, as discussed in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’, Australian bond yields remain relatively low, despite having risen a little recently. Real interest rates implied by the yields on indexed bonds, as well as the real lending rates derived using various measures of inflation expectations, are also slightly below their long-term averages. In real terms, the trade-weighted exchange rate is around 12 per cent above its average over the post-float period (Graph 52). ", " Total credit growth remains high, at an annualised rate of 12.3 per cent over the six months to December, but has eased substantially from the peak seen around the end of 2003 (Table 14 and Graph 53). This slowing is attributable to the household credit component, which expanded at an annualised rate of 13.2 per cent over the same period, compared with the peak a year previously of more than 21 per cent. ", " Both housing credit and non-housing personal credit growth moderated in the first half of 2004, but only housing credit continued this trend into the second half of the year. The pace of growth in housing credit nonetheless remains brisk, and now appears to have stabilised, at an annual rate of around 12½ per cent over the six months to December. The rate of growth in housing credit is consistent with the rate that would be expected given the level of loan approvals. This follows a period in 2002 and 2003 when it was stronger than would have been suggested by the prevailing level of loan approvals, perhaps partly reflecting a greater than usual amount of redrawing of funds from existing housing loans. Personal credit recorded strong growth over the second half of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2004</span>, with the fixed-term loan component picking up in response to strong demand for new motor vehicle finance; growth in revolving credit has been broadly stable. ", " Year-ended business credit growth remains more moderate than that for household credit, but in contrast to the slowing in household credit growth, it has continued on the broad upward trend evident over the past few years. Combined with the current high level of business loan approvals and robust capital market raisings in recent months, this suggests that businesses are still finding it quite easy to obtain finance. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.8 per cent in the December quarter to be 2.6 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 54). Petrol price increases continued to make significant contributions both in the quarter and over the year; excluding petrol, the CPI increased by 2.0 per cent over the year to December. Based on a range of different indicators of underlying inflation, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation was around <span class=\"no-wrap\">2¼ per cent</span> in year-ended terms <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 15)</span>. ", " While the divergence between inflation of tradable and non-tradable items persisted in the December quarter, the gap appears to have been narrowing (Graph 55). The rate of decline in tradables prices continues to slow, suggesting that the maximum impact of the exchange rate appreciation in 2002 and 2003 has passed; excluding food and petrol, tradables prices were only 0.6 per cent lower in the December quarter than a year previously. The year-ended rate of non-tradables inflation slowed to some extent over 2004, but remained firm at <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span>. The largest contribution to non-tradables inflation was made by house purchase costs, which increased by 1.5 per cent in the quarter and by over 5 per cent over the year. These increases can partly be attributed to rising costs for skilled labour and materials such as steel. ", " Producer price data for the December quarter confirm that upstream price pressures were building in the second half of 2004, with surveys and liaison continuing to highlight raw material costs as a key source of these pressures. Price indices at all stages of production increased more rapidly in the second half of 2004 than in the first half <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 16)</span>. The prices of outputs from the final stage of production increased by 4.3 per cent over the year to the December quarter (Graph 56). Higher world oil prices had a direct effect at all stages of production through price rises for items such as oil, gas and refined petroleum products, while second-round effects were evident in price rises for a number of items, most notably basic chemical manufactures and road freight. In addition to the direct effects of high oil prices, broader upstream inflationary pressures were apparent, including further increases in building construction prices. The dampening effect of falling imported goods prices at the final stage of production continued to ease over the year to December, suggesting that the disinflationary impetus from the appreciation of the exchange rate in 2002 and 2003 has moderated substantially. ", " The price of construction output continued to increase at a rapid pace in the December quarter, to be more than 8 per cent higher in year-ended terms. Higher labour costs, due to skill shortages, and higher material costs, particularly for steel products, contributed to this price movement. In the manufacturing industry, the sharp increases seen in the September quarter in the prices of materials used and articles produced were followed by further price rises in December. ", " Although most indicators of wage pressure remained firm in the September quarter, there was only limited evidence to suggest that these pressures were gaining economy-wide momentum. The Wage Price Index (WPI) increased by 0.9 per cent in the September quarter (Graph 57). In year-ended terms, growth in the WPI was <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span> and has changed little since March 2003. The average annualised wage increase for enterprise bargaining agreements registered in the September quarter, reported by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), was similar to that seen over the past year at <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.1 per cent</span>. The average annualised wage increase for all current agreements remained at 3.9 per cent. Official data on labour costs based on wage-bill measures, such as average compensation of employees and average weekly ordinary time earnings, also gave little indication of emerging widespread wage pressure in the September quarter.  ", " The WPI measure of public-sector wage growth, at 3.9 per cent in year-ended terms, remained higher than private-sector growth, which stood at 3.4 per cent. Wage growth for the construction sector was 4.5 per cent over the year to the September quarter, which is the largest increase in the relatively short history of this series and is consistent with the recent strength in activity of this industry. Other significant year-ended wage increases were recorded for a number of industries with substantial public-sector representation, such as education. The average annualised wage increase across new enterprise agreements, as reported by DEWR, was also slightly larger for the public sector than for the private sector.  ", " Business survey data for the December quarter suggest that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable skilled labour (Graph 58). This is consistent with the recent strength in the labour market and with liaison, where reports of skill shortages remain widespread. In particular, liaison reports suggest that the strength in activity in the resources and non-residential construction industries has intensified shortages of skilled workers, leading to solid increases in wages and sub-contractor rates in those industries. Sharp increases in wages have also been reported in localised parts of the business services sector where skill shortages are particularly acute. In contrast, more broadly based business survey data for the December quarter suggest that wage pressures have not increased significantly. The NAB Quarterly Survey reported that year-ended growth in labour costs was broadly unchanged in December, and a similar rate of growth is expected in the March quarter. ", " One possible reconciliation between the wage pressures reported in liaison and the relatively more contained official data would be that the former capture increases in sub-contractor rates for self-employed workers that are not covered by standard wage measures. Many firms have reported rapid growth in non-wage bonus payments and a number have also reported increases in training costs. ", " Most indicators suggest that inflation is expected to increase over the next two years. The Bank's survey of market economists showed that the median forecast for CPI inflation for the year to June 2005 was unchanged following the release of the December quarter CPI (Table 17). The median expectation for CPI inflation over the year to June 2006 increased slightly. Union officials' median expectations also continue to point to a slight pick-up in inflation, with inflation expected to increase to 3 per cent by the end of 2005 and stabilise around this level. ", " Business surveys report that current inflationary pressures have firmed over the past quarter, and that expectations of future price growth are also being adjusted upwards. Both the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturing and the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey reported a rise in the net balance of firms increasing selling prices in the December quarter and expecting to increase prices in the coming months. The NAB survey reported that economy-wide product price inflation increased in the December quarter, while retail product price inflation was broadly steady. Both economy-wide and retail price inflation are expected to pick up in the March quarter. In contrast, medium-term inflation expectations implied by financial market prices, which are calculated as the difference between nominal and indexed bond yields, have been broadly stable at around 2.6 per cent over the past nine months. The median inflation expectations of consumers, as reported by the Melbourne Institute survey, have remained within their range of the past five years. ", " CPI inflation was 2.6 per cent over the year to the December quarter but as noted above, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation was around 2¼ per cent, similar to the previous few quarters. This will probably be the low point for underlying inflation in the current cycle, and is a higher trough than expected a year ago. While ongoing strength in domestic inflation over the past couple of years has been offset by the disinflationary effect of the large appreciation of the exchange rate in 2002 and 2003, this effect has probably been less than would have been expected based on previous experience. Looking ahead, further impacts from the exchange rate appreciation are likely to be limited: in fact, the prices of tradables (excluding food and petrol) were flat in the December quarter and their decline in year-ended terms moderated in the second half of 2004. Accordingly, underlying inflation is expected to pick up gradually to around 2½ per cent by the end of 2005 and to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 per cent</span> by the end of 2006. This profile is broadly in line with that presented in the November 2004 <em>Statement</em>, although the forecast provided at that time only extended to mid 2006. ", " The nature of the risks to the forecasts has shifted since then. The November <em>Statement</em> identified the pick-up in world oil prices in the second half of 2004 as the major risk to the inflation outlook, and the higher level of oil prices did contribute to the upstream inflationary pressures in producer prices in the December quarter. But given the easing in oil prices since then, the risk posed by oil for the inflation profile has receded somewhat. Instead, domestic pressures now present the biggest risk to the inflation profile. Production costs have increased over the past half year, as a result of higher raw materials prices, largely reflecting a period of strong domestic and international demand. The forecasts for healthy world growth in 2005 and the current broad strength in commodity prices suggest that these demand pressures will continue. In addition, labour market conditions have tightened over recent months, as seen in the above-trend growth in employment in the December quarter, the fall in the unemployment rate and reports of labour shortages and pressure on non-wage costs. These conditions increase the likelihood of wage pressures building beyond what is factored into the inflation forecast. ", "The sharp decline in the ‘other mineral fuels’ component, comprising oil, gas and other petroleum products, reflects a drop in oil production as Australia's developed oil reserves are being depleted, with many larger oilfields approaching the end of their productive lives. Consequently, exports of <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘other mineral fuels’</span> have fallen by around 30 per cent since late 2000. The fall in oil exports has been only partly offset by modest growth in LNG exports.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 3\">[3]</a></sup> ", "Supply capacity for refined metals has declined because a number of refineries and mining operations were shut down after owners decided they were no longer economic, with some temporary disruptions also reducing supply.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"r4\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 4\">[4]</a></sup> Low prices for some metals in the early part of the decade, and the later appreciation of the Australian dollar, appear to have contributed to poor profitability. The closure of uneconomic refineries and mining operations is likely to have been accelerated by global consolidation, which has given major mining firms greater ability to restrain global supply. Overall, recorded exports of refined metals have declined by 28 per cent from their peak in late 2001 (though this decline is overstated by around half, as discussed in footnote 1).", "Capacity in the gold industry has declined with the closure of a number of exhausted mines since <span class=\"no-wrap\">2000.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"r5\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 5\">[5]</a></sup></span> Thus, gold exports have trended down over recent years, after increasing steadily through the 1990s.", " As derivative markets have become more liquid and the use of instruments such as options more widespread, it has become increasingly possible to use information from these instruments to analyse underlying asset markets. For example, pricing of options on equity, fixed-interest or foreign exchange instruments contains information about the respective derivatives markets' assessment of current conditions and expected future price movements in the underlying markets. In this box we use the implied volatility of options<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"r8\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> to contrast fixed-interest and equity markets, where implied volatility has declined noticeably, with foreign exchange markets where volatility has not fallen as sharply. ", " Implied volatilities of the major equity indices have declined substantially since the start of 2003 (Graph A1). The high volatility seen over 2002 reflected heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook following the US recession, corporate malfeasance, the unwinding of the equity market bubble and the war in Iraq. Volatility moderated as major equity indices began to rebound, corporate profits staged a strong recovery, and the general economic outlook improved. The recent levels of implied volatilities for the three major overseas equity markets are low, but not unprecedented. Implied volatilities in the US and Europe have returned to levels that were typical between 1992 and 1996. Implied volatility in Japan, despite its recent fall, remains well above the lows reached in 1994. In contrast, the implied volatility of Australian equities is at an all-time low. ", " Implied volatilities in fixed-interest markets have also declined significantly, with the volatilities of shorter-term instruments falling by more than those of longer dated ones (Graph A2). Implied volatilities gradually declined around the world in the second half of 2003, as it became clearer that the easing cycle was drawing to a close, with some central banks beginning to tighten monetary policy after a prolonged period of relatively low and stable interest rates. It is possible that a large part of the decline in implied volatilities of interest rates can be attributed to reduced uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy at that turning point. ", " There appears to be little evidence that the compression of volatilities in equity and debt markets is being driven by an increased willingness to supply (write) options. If options writers were underpricing options in order to try to expand their activities, then implied volatility would be persistently below the subsequently realised volatility of the underlying assets over the life of the options. But recently, implied volatilities have generally moved in line with realised volatilities across the major global asset markets. ", " In January 2002 the US dollar reached a multi-year high on a trade-weighted basis against the major floating currencies. Since then, developments in implied volatilities of currencies against the US dollar have been mixed. Some currencies, such as the Australian and Canadian dollars, have seen increases in both short- and long-term implied volatilities. But for other currencies, such as the euro and the yen, implied volatilities remain broadly unchanged (Graph A3). Overall, implied volatilities of foreign exchange rates have exhibited a less clear trend than those observed in equity and fixed-interest markets. ", " In general, recent developments in option markets indicate an expectation of continued low volatility in equity and bond markets, but continuing uncertainty in foreign exchange markets. Despite these developments, it is possible that the recent low level of realised volatility may have led markets to become a little complacent and hence the low implied volatility may not reflect future risks in these markets. ", " Over the past couple of years, central banks in most major economies have maintained unusually low official interest rates, which in turn have depressed interest rates on low-risk assets such as government debt. This low interest rate environment and the growing pool of institutional funds have encouraged investors to search for investment options that offer a higher yield. This is evident in a number of developments, including: increased demand for higher-risk assets; the increase in ‘carry trades’ – a form of gearing where funds are borrowed short-term at low interest rates and invested in higher-yielding assets, often in other countries; growth in alternative investment vehicles such as hedge funds; and growth in alternative investment strategies such as selling embedded options (see <a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>). ", " With interest rates on low-risk investments falling to low levels in many countries, investors have sought to maintain yields by moving into higher-risk assets such as corporate debt and emerging market debt. As they have done so, credit spreads on these assets have declined, which means that investors are receiving less compensation for the risk they are taking on. Spreads on US Corporate Junk (B-rated) bonds have fallen by around 600 basis points over the past couple of years while spreads on C-rated bonds have fallen by around 2500 basis points. Spreads on emerging market debt have narrowed by around 500 basis points. All these spreads are currently at very low levels by historical standards (Graph B1). ", " A factor which has encouraged the compression of credit spreads has been the strength of the global economy, as it has led investors to become less risk averse in the face of strong corporate profit growth, sound corporate balance sheets and good economic performance by emerging market economies. While these developments have been taken as signs that the riskiness of corporate and emerging market debt has declined, it remains to be seen whether current spreads are sustainable or whether they are underpricing risk. It is interesting to note, however, that investors do seem to be differentiating between the various types of high-yield investments. For example, the spread on debt of the Philippines has remained at relatively high levels compared to other countries in the region (Graph B2). Likewise the spread on Argentinean debt has remained at relatively high levels compared to other Latin American countries. ", " Some investors are also seeking to improve returns by gearing part of their investments through <span class=\"no-wrap\">‘carry trades’</span>. These involve the investor borrowing at the short end of the yield curve, particularly in those countries where rates have been very low, such as the United States, Japan and Switzerland, and investing either further out along the yield curve or in countries where interest rates have been relatively high, such as Australia and the United Kingdom. In doing so, investors are taking on a range of risks such as exposure to changes in the shape of the yield curve, credit spreads or exchange rates. The increased use of carry trades to fund cross-border investments has contributed to the large increase in global foreign exchange turnover over recent years, particularly in currencies like the Australian dollar.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"r9\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " The low interest rate environment may also have encouraged a shift in investments towards hedge funds as, in the past, hedge funds have achieved higher average returns than traditionally managed investments, albeit in exchange for greater risk. Hedge fund assets under management have almost doubled over the past five years and are now estimated to be almost US$1,000 billion (Graph B3). There are signs, however, that the recent large inflows into hedge funds have changed the risk/return characteristics of the industry. Hedge funds appear to be having trouble maintaining their rate of return as their typical investment plays have become ‘crowded’. This in turn has caused some hedge funds to seek a wider range of investment opportunities and to take on more risk. ", " With policy rates increasing in a number of countries, the investment positions put in place over the past couple of years in response to low interest rates are likely to be unwound, particularly as the scope for low-cost funding of these investment strategies will diminish. If circumstances allow the unwinding of these positions to occur in an orderly fashion – e.g. if global inflationary pressures remain subdued and rises in official interest rates take place at a measured pace – the unwinding process is unlikely to put large stresses on financial markets. On the other hand, were an economic shock to cause a faster-than-anticipated rise in global policy rates, these positions could be reversed very sharply, causing dislocation in financial markets.

The global upswing has maintained its momentum since the early part of the year and should provide an improving environment for Australian exporters. Business and consumer confidence are at high levels. At the same time, adjustment is occurring in the Australian housing market, which is no longer in the overheated condition seen at the end of last year. ", " The renewed pick-up in global economic growth has been underway for more than a year now and has become increasingly broadly based. The US recovery is firmly established, with business investment contributing strongly to the expansion along with consumer demand. With healthy employment growth over recent months, initial concerns about a ‘jobless recovery’ have faded. Core inflation in the US remains relatively low but has picked up noticeably since the start of the year, so that earlier concerns about the risk of deflation have also moved off the agenda. Reflecting the strong growth prospects for the economy and the pick-up in price pressures, the Federal Reserve has begun the process of normalising official interest rates from their historical low point, lifting the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent at its end-June meeting. ", " Other parts of the global economy are also enjoying strong or improving conditions. The Japanese economy is now in a solid expansion, recording its best conditions since the bursting of the asset-price bubble more than a decade ago. In China, growth has been exceptionally strong, prompting the Chinese authorities to take action to rein in overheated sectors of the economy. These measures have had some success in restraining growth but, even so, the pace remains very fast by the standards of any other country. Other parts of Asia are also showing continued economic strength, supported in most countries by growth in domestic demand as well as a continued rapid expansion of trade with China. The euro area economy, though still lagging the rest of the world, has shown further signs of improvement over recent months. ", " Against the background of the firming US economy, financial markets had fully anticipated the Fed's decision to raise official interest rates at its late June meeting, and the announcement passed largely without market reaction. With US interest rates still well below historical norms, markets expect additional tightening, and a further increase in the funds rate of 100 basis points is currently priced in over the next six months. Several other central banks – the Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Swiss National Bank – have also raised their interest rates recently. In Australia, market interest rate expectations remained broadly steady through this period, with markets assessing that Australian rates were closer to normal than in most other countries. The market continues to expect that Australia's cash rate will remain unchanged in the next few months but that some further tightening will occur in due course. ", " The exchange rate of the Australian dollar has remained in a range well below the peak reached earlier in the year. The main reason for this change in sentiment towards the Australian dollar was the growing prospect of US monetary tightening, and the expectation that it would mean a narrowing of Australia's interest differential against the US. In late July/early August the Australian dollar was trading around US70 cents, 12 per cent below its February peak, and 9 per cent down in trade-weighted terms. ", " The Australian economy is continuing to expand at a good pace. Consumer confidence is at its highest level in a decade and consumer spending has started to receive a significant boost from the additional benefit payments and tax cuts announced in the federal Budget. Business surveys are reporting better-than-average conditions and, with strong profitability and an improving international environment, the situation appears favourable to further expansion in business investment. Consistent with the general strength of the economy, the unemployment rate has trended down over the past year to around the lowest level seen over the past two decades. ", " The growth of the economy has for some time been driven by very strong growth in domestic demand, which has been partly offset by the external sector. With the international economy picking up, it has been reasonable to expect a gradual rebalancing of growth to get underway, involving a stronger export performance and less reliance on growth in domestic demand. To date, while the economy has maintained a strong pace overall, this rebalancing has been slow to materialise. There are, however, some indications that the economy is now benefiting from the global upswing. One mechanism for this has been the lift in global commodity prices and the associated improvement in Australia's terms of trade. In the March quarter the terms of trade were 10 per cent higher than a year earlier, and they are likely to have risen further in the June quarter. The resultant increase in incomes is one of the factors that have supported domestic spending growth. ", " In addition, it now seems clear that, after an extended period of weakness, the level of exports has passed its trough. At this stage, the pick-up in exports has been quite narrowly based. Much of it has been driven by the improvement in rural conditions and the recovery in international tourism, while resource and manufactured exports have been relatively flat. Factors that may have contributed to the subdued performance in these sectors include the appreciation of the exchange rate during 2002 and 2003, which may have dampened growth in manufactured exports in particular, and capacity constraints in the resources sector. However, these effects are likely to wane, with the exchange rate having been well below its peak in recent months, while the resources sector will benefit from the significant new capacity starting to come on stream this year. Hence, given a supportive global environment, there are good prospects that export growth will become more broadly based over time. ", " Australia's inflation rate in underlying terms remains relatively low. The June quarter CPI showed a rise in the annual inflation rate to 2½ per cent, from a rate of 2 per cent in the March quarter, but this movement largely reflected the effects of petrol price fluctuations on the year-ended calculation. Looking through the volatility, the various underlying measures suggest an underlying inflation rate of just over 2 per cent, which is down by around a percentage point from its recent peak. It is unlikely, however, that this will decline much further, if at all. At present, inflation is still being held down by the ongoing effects of the 2002–2003 exchange rate appreciation, but it can be expected to move higher in due course as those effects wane. While this has been broadly the expectation for some time, it now appears likely that the trough in underlying inflation will turn out to be somewhat higher than envisaged in previous <em>Statements</em>. The Bank's current assessment is that underlying inflation will remain close to 2 per cent for a little while longer, probably through to around the end of this year, and then start rising to around 2½ per cent by the end of 2005. Beyond that period, it could be expected to rise further if the current strength of domestically sourced inflation persists. ", " Developments in the housing market, and the associated growth in credit, have had an important bearing on assessments of the economic situation in the recent period. The overheating in the housing market last year carried the potential to destabilise the broader economy, the more so the longer it continued. There are clear indications, however, that the situation has now changed. After the rapid increases in house prices up to the end of last year, the available indicators suggest that prices declined in the first half of 2004. Auction clearance rates fell sharply around the turn of the year and have since remained well below average, suggesting vendors' price expectations are not being met. There has also been an easing in the demand for housing finance, particularly from investors, though this will need to adjust further if the growth of housing credit is to return to a reasonably sustainable pace. Although, at this stage, the fall in house prices and slowing in finance have been relatively modest, these trends are indicative of an easing in demand pressures in the housing market after the overheated conditions that prevailed last year. ", " In its policy deliberations over the past three months, the Board has taken into consideration the improving international environment, the easing in pressures on the domestic housing market, and the broader outlook for growth and inflation in Australia. The international situation is one in which interest rates in the major countries are likely to be increasing from their current abnormally low levels. Australian interest rates were never reduced to the extreme position adopted in a number of other countries, and there is no automatic reason that they will need to be moved up in line with the increases that are likely to occur overseas. On the other hand, with the policy stance in Australia still mildly accommodative, and the global economic environment likely to remain favourable to growth, it would be surprising if Australian interest rates did not have to increase further at some stage in the current expansion. ", " At present the Australian economy is continuing to experience a good pace of growth with relatively low inflation. The part of the economy that had been most prone to overheating in the recent period was the housing market and, as noted above, this is now in a process of adjustment. At the same time, it has become apparent that the restraining influence of the exchange rate on inflation has now reached its point of maximum effect, so that the underlying inflation rate can soon be expected to start increasing. This will need to be closely watched. At this stage, however, while growth prospects remain firm, the pick-up in inflation from its current trough appears likely to be quite gradual. ", " In these circumstances the Board decided at each of its three most recent monthly meetings to hold the cash rate unchanged. The Board will continue to monitor these developments, and will make such adjustments to policy as may be required to ensure that the conditions for sustainable growth with low inflation remain in place. ", " The international economy has strengthened further with most major regions now experiencing favourable conditions. The most notable improvement is in Japan where the economy is enjoying its strongest growth for a decade. Recovery in the euro area is more gradual but increasingly evident. Combined with continued strong growth in the US and east Asia, as well as in emerging economies in Latin America and eastern Europe, this points to an increasingly broad-based upswing in global growth. Overall, the latest Consensus forecasts are for world GDP growth to rise to 4.7 per cent in 2004 before easing a little to 4.3 per cent in 2005, which would be the strongest two years of growth since the late 1970s (Table 1). ", " Given mounting evidence that the global recovery is now firmly in place, central banks around the world have begun to remove some of their earlier policy stimulus. The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and a number of other central banks have lifted their policy rates in the past three months. ", " Growth in the United States remains strong, with GDP expanding by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.8 per cent</span> higher over the year (Graph 1). The composition of growth over the year has been broadly based, with consumption and investment both supported by highly expansionary monetary and fiscal policy settings. ", " The labour market has continued to improve, with an average monthly rise in non-farm payroll employment so far this year of slightly above 200,000 (Graph 2). Encouragingly, the employment gains have been widely distributed across sectors of the economy, with manufacturing employment now rising again following three and a half years of persistent job losses, and the share of firms reporting increased hiring rising strongly to an above-average level. Forward-looking indicators point to further solid job creation. The ISM employment indices are at high levels, and initial jobless claims are at levels usually commensurate with monthly payroll rises of 150,000–200,000. These positive developments, however, come after a prolonged period of labour market weakness, and it is likely that considerable slack still exists. Consequently, the labour market should be able to continue to improve without placing undue pressure on labour costs. ", " Consumption growth eased in the June quarter to 0.3 per cent, to be running at 3.4 per cent over the year. While the impact of tax cuts and child care rebates appears to have dissipated, it is likely that consumption growth will be supported by other factors, including the pick-up in consumer confidence (Graph 3), the improvement in the labour market, and household wealth, which has risen by 14 per cent over the year to the March quarter. ", " Conditions in the business sector remain positive. Business investment grew by 2.1 per cent in the June quarter, and is now 10 per cent higher over the year. Favourable financing conditions, accelerated depreciation allowances, rising capacity utilisation and strong business sentiment will lend support to business investment growth in the near term. Corporate gearing remains low, and corporate profits have risen by 28 per cent over the year to the March quarter, although some slowing in profit growth was evident in the March quarter. Growth in industrial production has remained firm and, with the inventory-to-sales ratio remaining at a record low, inventory rebuilding is expected to continue to contribute to near-term growth. ", " Recent inflation data in the United States have been signalling increased price pressures. CPI inflation stepped up to 3.3 per cent over the year to June (Graph 4). While much of this reflects transitory factors (such as higher oil prices), core CPI inflation has also picked up to 1.9 per cent over the year. Reflecting the solid outlook for growth and the pick-up in inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve began the process of normalising interest rates by raising the funds rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent in June, but noted that policy accommodation can be removed at a ‘measured’ pace. ", " Further positive news from Japan suggests that prospects for a sustained economic recovery are better now than they have been at any time since the bursting of the asset-price bubble more than a decade ago (see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>’ for further discussion). Japan's real GDP is recorded as growing by 1½ per cent in the March quarter and by 5.0 per cent over the year (Graph 5). Problems measuring the GDP deflator have probably resulted in this measure of real activity being overstated. Even so, nominal GDP growth has also picked up in recent quarters. Other more timely measures of activity, including industrial production and merchandise exports, also point to the strength of the recovery (Graph 6). ", " The corporate sector has been central to the current phase of recovery in economic activity. Corporate profits rose considerably over the year, with firms reporting that business conditions are at their strongest levels in <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 years or so (Graph 7)</span>. Business investment has now risen in each of the past seven quarters and was <span class=\"no-wrap\">14 per cent</span> higher over the year to the March quarter. Much of the strength remains concentrated within manufacturing, keying off robust external demand (particularly from China), but conditions in the services sector are also improving. ", " These developments have translated into a healthier labour market, with the unemployment rate having declined steadily over the past 18 months to 4.6 per cent in June. While much of this has been driven by declining labour force participation, associated with an aging population, employment has also picked up since late last year. Forward-looking indicators, such as the ratio of job offers to applicants, point to further near-term gains in employment. Improving employment prospects have helped to spur a recovery in household consumption and consumer sentiment (Graph 7). ", " The relative strength in domestic activity and rising commodity prices have driven up domestic corporate goods prices by 1.4 per cent over the year to June compared with average annual deflation of 1.0 per cent since the early 1990s <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 8)</span>. Final prices of consumption goods and services are still falling, and may continue to do so for a while yet given the considerable spare capacity in the economy, though the rate of decline has been easing. Consumer prices (excluding fresh food) fell by 0.1 per cent over the year to June, compared with rates of deflation of nearly 1 per cent during the past few years. Some, but certainly not all, of this improvement has been driven by temporary factors, such as rising rice prices (due to a bad harvest last year) and increases in tobacco taxes. The Bank of Japan appears committed to the current stance of easy monetary policy until consumer prices are seen to be rising over an extended period. ", " There are now signs that growth in China is slowing from the very rapid pace of recent quarters. This follows official measures aimed at reducing the growth rates of credit and money, restricting investment in industries that have been judged to have suffered overinvestment, and at the same time encouraging consumption, particularly among the rural population (see ‘<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>’ for further discussion). ", " GDP grew by 9.6 per cent over the year to the June quarter (Table 2). The Chinese statistical authorities do not produce data for quarterly growth, but some estimates suggest that this was around ½ per cent for the June quarter, compared with growth averaging about 3 per cent in earlier quarters. Growth in industrial production has slowed from a year-ended rate of 19.4 per cent in March to 16.2 per cent in June (Graph 9), and year-ended growth in fixed-asset investment has dropped sharply from 44 per cent in March to 23 per cent in June. This has been accompanied by an easing in the growth of the money supply and credit to around the government's targeted rates. Trade growth remains very strong with merchandise exports and imports growing by 47 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, in the year to June. Similarly, household spending has been robust, with an acceleration in retail sales in recent months taking growth to 13.9 per cent over the year to June. ", " Consumer price inflation has edged up further in recent months, reaching 5.0 per cent over the year to June. This was largely due to higher food prices, which rose by 14.0 per cent over this period, partly reflecting adverse seasonal conditions rather than more broadly based inflationary pressures. Higher commodity prices have also contributed to strong increases in corporate goods prices over the past year, although the latter fell by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.3 per cent</span> in June – the second consecutive monthly fall – suggesting that upstream price pressures may be abating. ", " Economic growth across the rest of east Asia remains healthy, notwithstanding signs of slowing in China, which has been a significant driver of export growth for the region. The overall strength of global economic activity and rising demand for ITC goods are stimulating rapid export growth across the region (Graphs 10 and 11). In addition, domestically sourced growth is making an increasing contribution as the region benefits from stimulatory macroeconomic policies and improving labour markets. Inflation for the moment remains low across most of east Asia, although inflationary pressures appear to be building. ", " Aggregate GDP in east Asia grew by almost 6 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Growth was especially strong, and above long-term average rates, in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore (Table 2). Growth continues to broaden to domestic demand, which rose strongly over the year. The main exception to this is Korea, where growth has been driven almost entirely by net exports. ", " Recent indicators suggest that the solid pace of growth in the region has continued into the June quarter. Industrial production and exports continue to expand at a brisk pace, rising by 14 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively, over the past year. Export growth has been strongest in those countries with the highest trade intensity with China. And while slower growth in China would, therefore, be expected to dampen export growth for the region, there are indications that domestic demand will still continue to grow strongly. In particular, retail sales and investment are rising strongly in most countries, propelled by improving labour markets, low interest rates and rising capacity utilisation rates (which are now back to levels last seen prior to the Asian financial crisis). Korea remains the main exception to this, with consumer spending still being dampened by excessive household debt. ", " Inflation remains low across much of east Asia, but is on an upward trajectory (Graph 12). Rising food prices associated with poor harvests have been a feature in most countries in the region. However, measures of upstream prices indicate that inflationary pressures are increasing more broadly, underpinned by rising capacity utilisation and high commodity prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and Bank Indonesia have already begun tightening monetary policy in response to these pressures. ", " In India, GDP growth fell to relatively low levels in recent quarters, although it remained high over the year to the March quarter at 8.3 per cent. While growth of industrial production slowed over the three months to May, it remains on a consistent upward trend, and exports are growing strongly, rising by 35 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year to June</span>. ", " The New Zealand economy continues to grow strongly. GDP expanded by a much stronger-than-expected <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.3 per cent</span> in the March quarter to be 5.0 per cent higher over the year. Domestic demand was again the key driver of growth, rising by 8.9 per cent over the year. Although exports have recovered in the past two quarters, net exports remain a drag on growth. The strength of the economy has contributed to tight labour market conditions, with the unemployment rate currently at an historic low of 4.3 per cent. Over recent quarters the pass-through of the earlier appreciation of the New Zealand dollar has helped to mask the impact of rising inflation in the non-tradables sector. Citing these domestic price pressures, and the strength of activity more generally, the RBNZ raised the cash rate by 25 basis points in June and again in July to reach 6 per cent. ", " The recovery in the euro area has been much less pronounced than elsewhere, though conditions are improving. Euro area GDP expanded by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter, the strongest quarterly outcome since <span class=\"no-wrap\">March 2001</span>, to be 1.3 per cent higher over the year (Table 3). Much of the growth in the quarter was due to higher exports, with domestic demand growth still weak. Household consumption posted a solid increase in the quarter, although it appears to have been driven by tax cuts at the start of the year in some countries and does not seem to have been sustained into the June quarter. ", " Aggregate euro area figures mask divergent trends across countries. Among the larger economies, France is performing relatively well, recording its third successive quarter of above-trend growth in March, propelled by solid gains in consumption and investment. Conditions remain much weaker in Germany and Italy, where there are few signs of an upturn in domestic demand. ", " More recent data generally point to a continuing modest recovery in the June quarter, again driven by external demand. Surveys report relatively upbeat conditions in the business sector for both manufacturing and services <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 13)</span>. Industrial production has risen steadily in recent months, to be 3.8 per cent higher over the year to May. The upward trend is stronger for merchandise exports – which have risen by 10.6 per cent over this period – and business surveys suggest that exports will remain strong in the near term. ", " Soft labour market conditions and low confidence among consumers continue to hamper consumer spending. Retail sales have slipped back in recent months after a gain in the March quarter, with particular weakness evident in Italy and Germany (Graph 14). Having been steady at 8.9 per cent for the previous year, the unemployment rate nudged up to 9.0 per cent in April and has since remained at this level. ", " Higher oil prices in recent months have pushed inflation above the ECB's 2 per cent target. Underlying measures of inflation, however, remain around 2 per cent (Graph 15). The growth rate of labour costs has continued to moderate to be around 2½ per cent over the year to the March quarter, reflecting the weakness in the labour market. The ECB has held its policy rate steady at 2 per cent since June 2003. ", " The United Kingdom is in its twelfth year of economic expansion and growing strongly. In the June quarter, GDP rose by 0.9 per cent to be 3.7 per cent higher over the year. Consumer spending continues to lead the way, with retail sales up by 7.2 per cent over the year to June. Investment has also risen strongly, supported by robust growth in corporate profits, as has manufacturing production. The unemployment rate is at an historically low <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.8 per cent</span>. The pace of house price growth began to rise late in 2003, and has reached year-ended rates of over 20 per cent in recent months. Consumer price inflation has edged higher, primarily due to energy prices, to a year-ended rate of 1.6 per cent in June. The Bank of England raised its policy rate by 25 basis points in May and again in June to reach 4.5 per cent. ", " The strength of global economic activity has underpinned rising demand for oil, with prices in US dollar and SDR terms remaining above the peaks seen over the past few years (Graph 16). As well as the broader strength of global economic activity, the particular strength of both the US and China has also played a role in pushing up oil demand given that these economies are relatively intensive in their use of oil. In addition to rising demand, concerns about the security of oil supply, following disruptions in Iraq and potential interruptions in Nigeria and Russia, have added upward pressure to oil prices. While OPEC's decision at the beginning of June to increase production quotas appears to have had a dampening influence on prices, they remain high, at over <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$40 per barrel in early August</span>. ", " In late June the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points from its 45-year low of <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 per cent</span>. The move was widely anticipated and had little impact on financial markets. Rather, the pace of further monetary tightening in the US remains the primary focus of international financial markets, given the still highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. Pricing in futures markets suggests that market participants currently expect the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates by 100 basis points over the next six months <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 17)</span>. ", " Financial markets do not expect the monetary authorities in the euro area or Japan to change policy rates in the foreseeable future. In Europe, expectations of further cuts have dissipated in recent months, as the economic news has improved slightly. In Japan, despite the robust economic recovery seen in recent quarters, consumer prices have continued to fall modestly. Given that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has stated that it will maintain highly stimulative monetary policy until inflation becomes consistently positive, financial markets see little prospect of an increase in interest rates in Japan until the second half of 2005 at the earliest. ", " The Bank of England (BoE) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), the two central banks that followed the RBA in the tightening cycle, have continued on this path (Graph 18, Table 4). The BoE increased its repo rate by 25 basis points in both May and June, to reach 4.5 per cent, and has signalled that it expects to increase rates further over coming months. The RBNZ increased its official cash rate by 25 basis points in both June and July to <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span> and also indicated that further increases are likely to be needed over the year ahead. In its first move in the current cycle, the Swiss National Bank raised its target 3-month Libor rate in June, to 0.5 per cent from 0.25 per cent, where it had been since March 2003. ", " The Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised interest rates in line with the US Federal Reserve, as a result of its currency board arrangement. The Chinese authorities have implemented a number of financial measures to slow the pace of financial intermediation in an attempt to address their concerns that the Chinese economy is overheating (see <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a>). Elsewhere in Asia, the generally low level of interest rates has been maintained, notwithstanding strong economic growth throughout the region. Policy rates were unchanged in Latin America over the past three months. ", " Yields on government bonds continue to be driven by expectations about the path of US monetary policy. While the Federal Reserve's tightening in late June had relatively little immediate impact on the government bond market in the US, yields have nonetheless continued to be heavily influenced by any information which might have a bearing on the future path of Federal Reserve tightening. Economic data released in the first part of July, which was a little weaker than the market had expected, caused yields to fall to a low of 4.35 per cent. Yields rose again following comments by Dr Greenspan and, at 4.45 per cent currently, are around 70 basis points higher than their March 2004 low and 130 basis points above their low in mid 2003 (Graph 19). ", " Developments in the US have continued to exert a strong influence over day-to-day movements in <span class=\"no-wrap\">European bond yields</span>, although given the relatively subdued outlook for economic activity in Europe, the movement in European yields has tended to be more muted. German government bond yields are marginally higher than at the time of the last <em>Statement</em>. ", " Over the past year, the largest rise in yields has been in Japan, reflecting the extent of improvement in growth, which was largely unexpected. Yields on 10-year government debt rose sharply in June, peaking at 1.9 per cent – the highest level since September 2000 – as the flow of strong Japanese economic data continued and confidence in the sustainability of the economic recovery grew. Yields are currently around 140 basis points above their mid-2003 low. ", " The behaviour of credit spreads provides further evidence that the policy tightening in the US has, thus far, been digested relatively smoothly by financial markets. US corporate and emerging market sovereign spreads relative to US Treasuries both remain near historical lows despite the late June tightening. US investment grade corporate and B-rated junk bond spreads have risen only modestly since the last <em>Statement</em> (Graph 20), while spreads on the less credit-worthy C-rated junk bonds narrowed by around 40 basis points. ", " Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt widened by around 160 basis points in late April and in early May as the market began to focus on the impact of rising US interest rates on emerging market economies, but have since reversed around two-thirds of the increase. Overall, emerging market spreads are around 80 basis points higher than their low point at the start of 2004, but are still at historically low levels (Graph 21). ", " The major global equity indices are generally little changed since the beginning of this year, as markets weighed the implications of robust economic and profit growth against the prospect of a sustained monetary policy tightening in the US and higher oil prices (Graph 22, Table 5). In the US the S&amp;P 500 is down around 2 per cent over the past three months and is approximately flat for the year. This is despite continued strong growth in corporate profits – the national accounts measure of earnings increased by 28 per cent in the year to the March quarter, while the profit share remains near cyclical highs. In the euro area the Euro STOXX is down 3 per cent over the past three months and is also flat in 2004. Despite the recent flatness, the S&amp;P 500 is 37 per cent above its March 2003 trough, while the Euro STOXX is around 48 per cent higher than its trough. ", " Valuations in the US share market continue to be high relative to historical benchmarks. The P/E ratio for the <span class=\"no-wrap\">S&amp;P 500 remains around 20</span>, compared to a long-run average of 15 (Graph 23). Other than in the current episode, the S&amp;P 500's P/E ratio has never been sustained above 20 for more than around three years, with previous periods above 20 followed by a significant correction in equity prices. ", " Asian equity markets have been more volatile than those in the US and Europe in 2004. The Japanese Topix has fallen by 5 per cent over the past 3 months, but is up 8 per cent so far this year, and is around 46 per cent higher than its 2003 low, in line with the economic recovery. Non-Japan Asian share prices have fallen 3 per cent on average over the past three months. Reflecting concerns about the extent of the prospective slowdown in the Chinese economy and the effect of rising US interest rates, average equity prices in mainland China and <span class=\"no-wrap\">South Korea</span> have fallen by 16 per cent over the past three months. Share prices in India have declined by <span class=\"no-wrap\">9 per cent</span> since the last <em>Statement</em>, amid concerns about a possible slowdown in the pace of reform under the newly elected government. On average Latin American share prices have performed better than other markets over the past three months, rising by 7 per cent. ", " The US dollar has moved in two phases over 2004 (Graph 24). After falling in the previous two years, the dollar appreciated by 6 per cent on a trade-weighted basis from January through to mid May, as greater confidence in the US economic recovery and the increasing likelihood that interest rates would rise supported the currency. However, in mid May the uptrend in the US dollar stalled and the currency has subsequently depreciated by around 2 per cent. This turnaround predominantly reflected the softer-than-expected data in the US for the month of June, which reduced expectations about the future pace of monetary tightening. Overall, the US dollar is around 11 per cent lower than at its peak in early 2002, although in real effective terms it remains around <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> above its long-run average. ", " Movements in both the euro and the yen have mainly reflected developments in the US dollar over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">past three months (Graph 25)</span>. After falling to 1.18 against the US dollar in mid May, the euro has since risen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. Similarly, the yen reached a trough at 114 per US dollar in mid May, before appreciating by 3 per cent more recently. ", " Non-Japan Asian exchange rates were relatively stable against the US dollar on average over the past <span class=\"no-wrap\">3 months (Graph 26)</span>. The rapid pace of reserve accumulation by many Asian central banks has eased in 2004, in part reflecting the appreciation of the US dollar over this period. The Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah were among the most volatile of the regional currencies, as a result of uncertainty surrounding their respective elections. Exchange rates in Latin America have also generally been relatively stable against the US dollar since the last <em>Statement</em>. ", " After reaching a seven-year high of US80 cents in mid February 2004, the Australian dollar declined by <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent (to just under US68 cents)</span> against the US dollar by mid June and by 12 per cent (to 59) on a <span class=\"no-wrap\">trade-weighted basis (TWI)</span> (Graph 27). The depreciation was primarily a reflection of the strength of the US dollar over this period. It also reflected the reversal of some of the ‘yield plays’ that had been put in place over the previous year in which the Australian dollar had featured prominently. Consequently the Australian dollar's depreciation over this period tended to be larger than that of other currencies. ", " However, since mid June, the Australian dollar has risen modestly, reaching a high of 73½ US cents before easing back to around 70 cents more recently. While the most recent appreciation has again been largely a function of movements in the US dollar (see the section above on ‘<a href=\"#er\">Exchange rates</a>’), the Australian dollar has also appreciated modestly against many of its other trading partners that float (Graph 28, Table 6) as some of the yield plays were reinstated. Continuing strength in commodity markets also boosted demand for the currency. Speculative positions on the Chicago Futures Exchange, which had been short for a few months earlier in 2004, have also turned back from short to long. ", " The pattern described in the last <em>Statement</em>, whereby most of the significant moves in the Australian dollar occurred in the overnight trading sessions, has continued in the latest three months, indicating the continuing importance of offshore investors and events in influencing the exchange rate (Graph 29). ", " With the exchange rate no longer rising as strongly as it did through the second half of 2003 and early 2004, the Bank has stopped adding to its holdings of official reserve assets. Over the past three months purchases of foreign exchange have been limited to those necessary to cover the requirements of the government and therefore did not add to reserves. However, the A$ value of net foreign reserves has risen by almost $2 billion since the end of April, mainly due to valuation effects imparted by the lower Australian dollar. As at the end of July, net reserve assets were $24.5 billion. ", " The Bank has continued to make substantial use of foreign exchange swaps to manage domestic liquidity during the past three months. With the market facing large claims on liquidity due to seasonal tax collections, the Bank had $26.2 billion of swaps outstanding in late July. ", " Following a rapid expansion over the second half of 2003, the Australian economy grew by a modest 0.2 per cent in the March quarter 2004, to be 3¼ per cent higher over the year (Graph 30). While GDP figures are not yet available for the June quarter, the early indications are consistent with a stronger result for the quarterly growth rate. ", " The slowing in growth in the March quarter national accounts reflected falls in all components of domestic final demand except household consumption. Consumer spending continued its recent strong growth, reflecting robust consumer confidence and the effects of previous increases in wealth. In contrast, both business investment and dwelling investment fell in the March quarter; the former is likely to be a temporary pause in growth, with survey indicators auguring well for business investment in the medium term, while the latter appears likely to be revised upwards based on more recent information. Offsetting these falls, a large build-up of stocks resulted in gross national expenditure increasing by 1¼ per cent in the quarter. Meanwhile, recovery in the rural sector continued, with farm output contributing 0.2 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth. ", " Despite reasonably solid export growth, net trade continued to weigh on growth in the March quarter. Import volumes grew at their fastest rate in nearly seven years, driven by the appreciation of the exchange rate over <span class=\"no-wrap\">2002–2003</span> and the ongoing strength in domestic spending. However, recent trade data suggest that growth in imports has since moderated, while export growth has remained solid, in line with the improving international environment. These developments, combined with an expected easing in growth in domestic spending, hold out the prospect for more balanced and sustainable growth in the period ahead. ", " The rapid growth in consumer spending over the course of 2003 continued into the March quarter. Household consumption increased by 1.2 per cent, to be 6.2 per cent higher over the year. While growth in the quarter was broadly based, growth in expenditure on goods was particularly strong. Expenditure on motor vehicles rose strongly, underpinned by a high level of vehicle affordability, while expenditure on furnishings and household equipment also rose markedly, reflecting the strength in housing activity in the second half of 2003. ", " More recently, retail trade data for the June quarter show renewed strength, although not quite to the extent seen in the second half of 2003 (Graph 31). Much of the pick-up in spending occurred late in the quarter, with the value of retail sales rising by 2.1 per cent in June, buoyed by the lump-sum payments to families and carers announced in the 2004/05 federal Budget. These spending initiatives, along with income-tax reductions in the Budget, are likely to boost consumption in the next few quarters. Sales of motor vehicles fell slightly in the June quarter but remain at very high levels. ", " The ongoing strong growth in consumption is hardly surprising, given the favourable financial and labour market conditions of the past year and the strong gains in wealth since the late 1990s. In particular, the doubling of aggregate housing prices since 1998 has increased wealth significantly, helping to allow consumption growth to outpace the rise in income. While these wealth effects can be expected to diminish in line with the easing in housing prices since late 2003, the cumulative increase in wealth over the past decade remains considerable and may still have some way to work through. Consistent with the strong pace of growth in consumer income and spending, the Westpac-Melbourne Institute measure of consumer sentiment increased in July to the highest level in 10 years. ", " With household consumption growth running ahead of income growth, a further decline in the household saving ratio has occurred. At the same time, credit extended to households has continued to increase at a rapid pace over the first half of 2004, growing by around 19½ per cent over the year to June. With household debt continuing to rise, the aggregate household debt-servicing ratio increased further in the March quarter, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">9.4 per cent</span> of disposable income (Graph 32). The increase also partly reflected the interest rate rises of <span class=\"no-wrap\">late 2003</span>, which flowed through to a higher average interest rate on household loans in the March quarter compared with the December quarter. Indicators of financial stress for the household sector, such as loan arrears, continue to suggest that the current debt-servicing burden is not significantly affecting household behaviour at present. ", " Following strong growth during the second half of 2003, the national accounts measure of dwelling investment fell by 1.3 per cent in the March quarter to be 3.1 per cent higher over the year. More recent ABS data on housing activity suggest that the national accounts measure of dwelling investment in the March quarter may be revised upwards to show a small rise. ", " The number of building approvals has been broadly flat in the first half of this year. While building approvals for detached houses have been on a downward trend since mid last year, since the end of last year there has been an offsetting increase in approvals in the medium-density sector, which have been sustained at high levels over the past three months (Graph 33). The value of building approvals for renovations and extensions has also picked up over the past three months, after a period of weakness earlier in the year. Other leading indicators of housing construction have been more suggestive of a slowing in housing activity. Display home traffic and land sales are well below levels of a year ago, and the Housing Industry Association series of commitments to build houses remains below its recent peak (Graph 34). In addition, a survey by the Master Builders Association of its members, conducted in May and June, reported that housing construction activity fell in the June quarter. Nonetheless, along with the generally favourable macroeconomic outlook and continuing strength in underlying demand for housing, the data for approvals and work in the pipeline suggest that the expected cyclical downturn in dwelling investment is likely to be very modest by historical standards. ", " After peaking at $15 billion in October 2003, the value of monthly housing loan approvals stabilised over the first five months of 2004 at an average level of around $12½ billion (Graph 35). Although loan approvals to investors have come off by more than approvals to owner-occupiers, investor approvals are still far above the levels of a few years ago. These developments in loan approvals have been reflected in broadly consistent behaviour of housing credit. Housing credit continues to grow strongly, rising at an annualised rate of 18½ per cent over the six months to June, compared with its peak annualised growth rate of 22½ per cent over the second half of 2003. Looking ahead, the value of housing loan approvals would need to fall significantly further to bring housing credit growth back to a more sustainable pace. ", " A reasonable amount of data is now available for house prices in the June quarter: the Commonwealth Bank (CBA) figures, preliminary estimates from Australian Property Monitors (APM), the reports from four of the state <span class=\"no-wrap\">Real Estate Institutes (REIs)</span> and some preliminary figures for three state capitals from Residex (Table 7). Like the March quarter, the predominant result is for price falls, particularly for Sydney and Melbourne. Details of the different methodologies of each price measure are explained in the article ‘<a href=\"/publications/bulletin/2004/jul/1.html\">Measuring Housing Prices</a>’ in the July <cite>Bulletin</cite>. ", " The CBA figures show price falls in Sydney and Melbourne, a smaller fall in Adelaide, and rises elsewhere. These figures are for house purchases made by the CBA's customers and are not subject to revision. The APM figures show falls for Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Canberra. These are preliminary figures and, on the basis of previous experience, are likely to be revised upwards as the sample size increases when additional transactions are included in the state government data.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> The state REIs show price falls in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, and a rise in Adelaide. As in the March quarter, the Residex figures show a flatter picture than the other measures. ", " There are now enough data to compare developments in the two halves of 2003/04 (Table 8). This approach has the advantage of eliminating some of the quarter-to-quarter variability in the various series. It is clear that in each measure there has been a major turnaround between the two half-years. Each measure shows strong increases over the second half of 2003 in all cities, with the only exception being that two series show only moderate increases for Melbourne at that time. For the first half of 2004, the general tendency is for prices to fall, including on average for Australia, but the picture is more mixed. Three of the series show falls for Sydney and Melbourne, and two of the four show falls for Brisbane. For the other capitals, most measures show a flat picture or modest increases. Interestingly, the averages for Australia from the CBA and APM for the two half-years are remarkably similar (subject to the caveat that the APM figures will be revised). ", " The evidence regarding apartment prices also suggests that nationwide prices have fallen over the first half of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2004</span>, following the strong increases seen in 2003 (Table 9). The CBA series suggest a small fall in nationwide average prices, driven by falls in Sydney and Melbourne. The estimates from APM suggest a larger fall, but are subject to revision. Both series, however, show smaller falls for apartment prices than for house prices. This result is not consistent with many industry reports, which suggest greater weakness in the apartment sector than for houses. ", " Although they represent only a small proportion of total sales, auction results also suggest that demand remains subdued in the housing market. Despite picking up a little in recent weeks, auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne remain well below the levels observed in the equivalent periods in previous years (Graph 36). ", " Conditions in the business sector have remained strong. Business expectations and investment intentions are positive, profitability is at a high level, and the strengthening outlook for the world economy is contributing to improved prospects for the trade-exposed sectors. ", " Production in the non-farm economy expanded at a modest pace in the March quarter, while farm output remained strong as the rural recovery consolidated, despite continued dry conditions in some regions. After a protracted period of divergent outcomes, the goods and services sectors saw similar year-ended growth rates of output. In the non-farm economy, output growth remained strongest in those industries exposed to domestic demand, including wholesale and retail trade, construction, transport, and business services. In contrast, growth was much weaker in export-oriented industries, particularly in mining, where expansion of output has been inhibited by capacity constraints and temporary disruptions to production (Graph 37). ", " Surveys show that business conditions remained healthy in the June quarter. The NAB survey of the non-farm sector reported that business conditions were well above long-run average levels, underpinned by high levels of sales, profitability and employment (Graph 38). Orders were strong and capacity utilisation was around the level of previous peaks, although it was down from the level in the December quarter 2003. In contrast to the national accounts data for 2003 and the March quarter 2004, the survey suggests that business conditions strengthened in the export-oriented industries of mining and manufacturing in response to the recovery in economic activity abroad. In contrast, conditions eased in construction and some of the other industries sensitive to domestic demand. ", " The Australian Industry Group (AIG) and ACCI-Westpac surveys pointed to similarly strong business conditions in the manufacturing sector. Like the NAB survey, the AIG survey suggests some rebalancing of activity towards export-oriented industries. The ACCI-Westpac survey's composite index of activity, comprising survey measures of employment, new orders, output and overtime, rose in the June quarter to be well above its long-run average level. ", " Corporate profits weakened in the March quarter, but remained 6½ per cent higher over the year following the strong growth seen in the second half of 2003. Profitability in domestically focused industries has been strong for some time, while mining profitability was affected by the appreciation of the exchange rate up to the March quarter. The profitability of unincorporated enterprises remained firm in the quarter, driven by the continued recovery in farm profitability. Looking forward, business surveys show profitability is expected to remain higher than average. ", " The high level of corporate profitability continues to provide firms with a solid base of internal funds to pursue their investment plans. In addition, corporate gearing and debt-servicing costs remain low. External fund raising activity was subdued in the March quarter, but rebounded in the June quarter. Over the year to June, growth in business credit remained around the average recorded over recent years. ", " Following robust growth in the second half of 2003, new business investment contracted by 1.5 per cent in the March quarter 2004 (Graph 39). The fall was driven by a 2.3 per cent decline in the machinery and equipment component, though this movement is a little at odds with the strong rise in capital equipment imported in the quarter. Buildings and structures investment held at the high level reached at the end of 2003, with growth in engineering construction more than offsetting a fall in the non-residential building component. However, more recent ABS data suggest that both of these components are likely to be revised down. ", " Despite the weak March quarter investment outturn, the high level of capacity utilisation and healthy financial position of businesses remain supportive of further growth in business investment. The current upswing in world growth, together with the easing in the exchange rate from its early 2004 peak, is likely to provide additional impetus to investment by firms exposed to the external sector. ", " Recent surveys of investment intentions confirm that the medium-term outlook for investment is positive and has improved in the past three months. The latest ABS Capital Expenditure (Capex) survey points to solid growth in business investment in 2004/05. Intentions for machinery and equipment investment, adjusted by a five-year average realisation ratio, suggest year-average growth of around 5 per cent in real terms. Similarly, the Rabobank survey reports that equipment investment in the farm sector – which is not included in the Capex survey – is likely to remain strong over the year ahead at close to pre-drought levels. ", " The Capex survey indicates that intentions for buildings and structures investment have been revised up significantly in recent months, particularly in the mining sector, and now suggest a substantial lift in growth in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2004/05</span>. Other forward-looking indicators of investment in buildings and structures also suggest continued strength in the overall non-residential construction cycle. Indications are that growth will be heavily skewed towards the engineering construction component of activity. Consistent with the strong world demand for resources, the Access Economics <em>Investment Monitor</em> notes the recent commitment to the construction of a number of high-value projects designed to expand capacity in the resources sector in late 2004. In contrast, the recent decline in the value of building work approved suggests that the non-residential building cycle is likely to have peaked, though the high level of work yet to be done is likely to support activity at high levels in the near term (Graph 40). ", " The 2004/05 Australian Government Budget, delivered in May, showed a modest reduction in the expected surplus in both underlying cash and accrual terms (Graph 41). This reflected a number of new policy decisions, which more than offset the higher forecast for revenue collections in the budget year. New policy decisions announced in the Budget included personal income tax cuts, additional payments to families eligible for the Family Tax Benefit, and increased spending directed at aged care and retirement savings. Fiscal policy is therefore likely to be expansionary in 2004/05. In addition, the budgets of state governments are expected to have a further mild expansionary impact. ", " Labour market conditions remained firm over the first half of 2004. Employment grew by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, and by 2.3 per cent over the year. After several years in which growth had been driven by part-time employment, employment growth has more recently been heavily concentrated in full-time jobs (Graph 42). ", " The unemployment rate continued to decline in the first half of 2004, driven by the strong gains in employment more than by the small fall in the number of people looking for work. In recent months the unemployment rate has been around 5½ per cent, which is roughly equal to the low points reached in 1981 and 1989 (Graph 43). The participation rate stood at 63½ per cent in June and, looking through the monthly volatility, it has been around this level for most of the past year. ", " Employment increased and the unemployment rate fell in all states over the year to the June quarter, though the improvement was only marginal in South Australia, where growth in final demand has been relatively soft <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 10)</span>. The strongest growth in employment and state final demand over the past year, and the largest falls in the unemployment rate, occurred in Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia. ", " At the industry level, employment growth in education, health and community services accounted for most of the overall gains over the year to the June quarter (Table 11). Within these industries, growth was concentrated in the professional occupations. The other main source of employment growth over the past year was the construction industry. In manufacturing, employment has recovered after a period of job shedding in <span class=\"no-wrap\">trade-exposed</span> sectors, and solid gains in recent quarters have seen overall manufacturing employment return to around the level of a year earlier. The main industry to subtract from employment over the past year was retail trade, where employment growth had previously been very strong. ", " Forward-looking indicators of labour demand presage further solid employment growth in the near term <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 44)</span>. The ABS measure of job vacancies picked up sharply in the June quarter and similarly strong signals have come from various internet-based vacancy series. Print-based indicators have also risen in recent months, though more modestly, and recent business surveys suggest that hiring intentions remain above long-run average levels. A wide range of business surveys, including the NAB survey, ACCI-Westpac survey, the Sensis Business Index of small and medium businesses, and the ACCI Survey of Investor Confidence, have pointed to firms experiencing difficulty finding suitably qualified labour (Graph 45). ", " Developments in the terms of trade have been a major factor influencing the balance of payments over the past year. The terms of trade have increased by more than 10 per cent over this period, driven largely by rising world commodity prices. This has contributed to a narrowing in the deficit on trade in goods and services from the peak of 3½ per cent of GDP in mid 2003, to around 3 per cent of GDP in the June quarter 2004 (Graph 46). In line with the narrowing in the trade deficit, the current account deficit is also likely to have narrowed in the June quarter to around 5¾ per cent of GDP from around 6½ per cent a year earlier (assuming that the net income deficit has remained constant as a share of GDP). These declines have, however, been smaller than might have been expected given the easing in drought conditions and the pick-up in global demand and world commodity prices since mid last year. This has reflected both a relatively modest recovery in export volumes to date, and continued strong growth in import volumes. ", " Export earnings have risen by about 12½ per cent since mid 2003, with much of the increase coming in the June quarter, when the value of exports rose by around 8½ per cent (Graph 47). Part of the increase over the past year has been due to rising prices, with export volumes up by around 8½ per cent since mid 2003. While it now seems clear that export volumes have passed their trough, the recent growth follows quite a lengthy period of subdued performance when exports had been dampened by the global economic downturn as well as by adverse conditions affecting tourism and rural exports. Seen against this background, the pick-up in export volumes so far has been relatively modest. ", " Resource export earnings have been boosted by rising prices over the past year but, to date, the sector has been characterised by disappointing performance in terms of volumes (Graph 48). The large rise in the value of resource exports of around 14 per cent in the June quarter was mainly due to significantly higher contract prices for bulk commodities, but was also boosted by the decline in the exchange rate between March and June. However, the volume of resource exports is estimated to have remained largely unchanged in the June quarter, continuing the broadly flat trend evident since 2000. ", " As resource export volumes are driven predominantly by supply factors, this subdued growth performance appears mainly to reflect the limited expansion in production capacity in recent years. This in turn has been a consequence of the sharp downturn in resource-related investment between 1998 and 2000, when commodity prices were at their lowest level in a decade (Graph 49). However, there are good prospects that these capacity constraints will ease over time. Resource-related investment has surged over the past three years, in line with strengthening global demand and commodity prices. Given the long lead times for resource projects, these investments have mostly not yet come on stream but are expected to result in significant capacity expansions later this year and next, particularly in coal, metal ores and LNG production. For example, data from Access Economics indicate that the value of resource projects completed in 2004 is likely to be around five times the level of completions in 2003. ", " Another key development in resource exports has been the steep decline in exports of ‘other mineral fuels’ – comprising oil, gas and other petroleum products – which have fallen by over 20 per cent since late 2000. This largely reflects declining oil production as some of Australia's oil fields are reaching the end of their productive lives, a trend which is expected to continue in the near term. Recent investment in this sector, however, points to an impending expansion in production, particularly, as noted above, for LNG. In addition, since mid 2003, resource exports have been hampered by transport infrastructure constraints, and more recently, an unusual spate of temporary supply disruptions. These infrastructure constraints are expected to be addressed over the next year or two, with expansion of several major ports and connecting rail facilities underway or soon to commence. ", " The value of manufactured exports began to recover in the first half of 2004, rising by around 7 per cent in the June quarter, following a similarly strong increase in the previous quarter, and largely reversing the decline seen over 2003. While volumes have also picked up during 2004, overall export performance in the sector has lagged the recent acceleration in growth among our trading partners. Part of this weakness is likely to have been related to a loss of competitiveness in world markets flowing from the appreciation of the exchange rate over the past couple of years. Another factor is the strength of domestic demand, which has made it easier for manufacturers to sell their products in the home market. ", " The value of rural exports has increased strongly over recent quarters from the drought-induced trough of <span class=\"no-wrap\">mid 2003</span>. Rural export earnings rose by a further 16 per cent in the June quarter, to be 36 per cent higher over the year. This recovery has been driven by a sharp increase in volumes. Cereals exports have accounted for most of this rise, following the record 2003/04 winter crop, along with increases in all other major components in the June quarter. However, the near-term outlook for rural exports will continue to be affected by the lingering effects of the drought, with the recovery in livestock-based exports likely to be protracted. In addition, a dry autumn delayed winter-crop plantings in many areas, though recent rains generally allowed planting to proceed, and the Bureau of Meteorology considers that the risk of an <span lang=\"es\">El Niño</span> event later this year has subsided. Overall, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects little change in livestock-based production in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2004/05</span> and only a 1½ per cent increase in crop production, given the rebound that has already occurred. ", " The value of service exports dipped slightly in the first half of 2004. The combination of the general recovery in international tourism from the SARS outbreak, a pick-up in world economic growth and the boost provided by the Rugby World Cup resulted in exceptionally strong growth in the second half of 2003. Since then, the number of overseas arrivals has levelled off, leaving the value of service exports around 4 per cent above the average in 2002 <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 50)</span>. ", " In contrast to the relatively modest growth of exports, import volumes have continued to grow strongly over recent quarters. This has been driven by robust growth in domestic demand and the falls in import prices that resulted from the appreciation of the Australian dollar over 2002–2003 (refer Graph 47). The volume of imports rose by 7 per cent in the March quarter 2004, to be around 17 per cent higher over the year. Growth in imports has been broad-based in consumption, capital and intermediate goods. Service imports have also expanded at a firm pace, with international travel by Australians buoyed by the rise in the Australian dollar since 2002. Import values rose by a further 6¼ per cent in the June quarter, with this outcome probably reflecting solid growth in volumes and higher prices following the depreciation of the exchange rate between March and June. ", " Rising global demand continues to support world commodity prices, despite some easing in prices in recent months. The RBA Index of Commodity Prices fell by 0.3 per cent over the three months to July, though it remains around 16 per cent above its trough in May 2003. The decline over recent months has been driven by weaker prices for rural commodities, though these have been partly offset by stronger prices for bulk commodities, with base metals prices also moving higher (Graph 51, Table 12). In contrast, with the Australian dollar having eased since February, commodity prices in Australian dollar terms have increased solidly, rising by 4.6 per cent over the past three months to approach the elevated levels seen during 2001–2002. ", " Expanding global industrial production, particularly in China, and an associated decline in stocks of raw materials have remained supportive of base metals prices. Over the three months to July, base metals prices rose by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.6 per cent</span> in SDR terms, driven by sharp increases in the prices of nickel and lead. This recent strength in base metals prices reversed the weakness seen in late April this year amid market speculation that measures taken by the Chinese authorities to slow the pace of growth in China may prove too heavy-handed. On average, base metals prices are more than 40 per cent above the level of late 2002. ", " The prices of other resource commodities have increased substantially in recent months following significant rises in negotiated contract prices for the year ahead. Coking coal contract prices were settled, on average, around <span class=\"no-wrap\">25–35 per cent</span> higher than last year in US dollar terms, underpinned by strengthening global steel demand. There has been further upward pressure on prices since many contracts were settled, with continued strong demand and growing signs of shortages in some countries. Steaming coal contracts for 2004/05, which were generally settled later than for coking coal, locked in price rises of up to 70 per cent, reflecting growing energy demand coupled with supply shortages owing to disruptions in major exporting countries. ", " Rural commodity prices have eased recently, falling by 6.5 per cent over the three months to July. Wheat prices have declined significantly over recent months, reflecting increased supply from the current US harvest, as well as expectations of increased global wheat production in the coming year. A forecast rise in global cotton production has also weighed on cotton prices. ", " The ongoing strength in world prices for Australia's exports, particularly for many commodities and services, combined with more subdued growth in import prices, continues to underpin a marked upward trend in Australia's terms of trade. After increasing by nearly 4 per cent in the March quarter, the terms of trade were 10 per cent higher than a year earlier, reaching their highest level in almost 28 years (Graph 52). The terms of trade appear likely to have increased further in the June quarter, given the considerable strength in bulk commodity prices observed in recent months. ", " Short-term market yields have not changed much in the past three months. They remain a little above the current cash rate (Graph 53). Markets are not expecting any change in the cash rate in the near future, though some rise is expected in due course. ", " Yields on 10-year government bonds, which had been around 6 per cent in the first half of May, have since fallen to around 5.7 per cent. Yields on 10-year inflation-linked bonds have moved similarly to be around 3.2 per cent in early August (Graph 54). ", " The yield curve has flattened somewhat over the past three months reflecting the falls in longer-term yields. The spread between yields on 10-year bonds and the cash rate was around 45 basis points in early August compared with around 70 basis points in early May (Graph 55). This is well below its average for the past decade. ", " The fall in domestic bond yields over recent months has been a little more than in the US, so the spread between the US and Australian 10-year government bond yield has narrowed from 135 basis points in early May to around 125 basis points (Graph 56). ", " There has been little change in the market's perceptions of credit risk during the past three months. Spreads between corporate bond yields and swap rates and the premia on credit default swaps (CDS) are slightly higher than they were at the beginning of 2004 but remain at relatively low levels (Graph 57). The low level of credit spreads in Australia is mirrored in other major bond markets and probably reflects both the improvement in the global economic outlook and the continued search for return in a low interest rate environment. ", " There has been no change in intermediaries' variable indicator lending rates since the last <em>Statement</em>, reflecting the unchanged stance of monetary policy. Fixed rates on housing and small business loans have also been largely unchanged over this period. ", " From a longer-run perspective, after rising by around 1¼ percentage points over the second half of 2003, fixed lending rates have been relatively steady at a little below their late 2003 peaks (Graph 58). This movement has been consistent with the movement in funding costs for fixed-rate loans over the same period. ", " Demand for fixed-rate housing loans has continued to moderate since late 2003, suggesting that households may have become less concerned about the risk of rising interest rates. The share of new owner-occupier housing loans taken out at fixed rates declined from a peak of 15 per cent in November 2003, to 7 per cent in May, which is a little below the long-run average share (Graph 59). The average 3-year fixed housing loan rate has been broadly in line with the standard variable rate since the beginning of the year (Table 13). ", " Australian share prices have risen by 4 per cent since the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> (Graphs 60 and 61). The ASX 200 index reached a new record high in early July but has since fallen slightly. In contrast, US and world equity prices have fallen slightly since the last <em>Statement</em> and remain almost 30 per cent below their March 2000 record highs. The strength in the Australian share market since early 2003 has contributed to a pick-up in margin lending (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). ", " All of the 10 sectors in the ASX 200 have risen in the period since the previous <em>Statement</em>, with each having outperformed its global counterpart (Table 14). The materials sector has risen by 12 per cent over the period, buoyed by rising metals prices in part because of reduced concerns about a significant growth deceleration in China. The energy sector has also continued to outperform the broader share market, with higher oil prices contributing to a 15 per cent rise in energy sector share prices. ", " Australian non-government entities issued $42 billion of bonds in the June quarter, close to the record $44 billion gross issuance seen in the March quarter. Financial institutions continued to issue large amounts, particularly in offshore markets (Table 15). Asset-backed issuance eased to $16 billion in the June quarter, from $21 billion in the March quarter, but remained strong by historical standards. The decline in asset-backed issuance primarily reflected lower issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) by traditional mortgage lenders (banks, building societies and credit unions); mortgage originators issued more RMBS than in the March quarter. ", " Issuance by non-financial institutions remained subdued. At a bit over $5 billion, non-financials' issuance in the first half of 2004 was less than half that seen in the same period of 2003. However, this weakness has been mostly offset by stronger equity raisings (Graph 62). ", " Non-residents issued $8 billion of Australian-dollar denominated bonds in the June quarter, markedly lower than issuance in the March quarter, but still a large amount by historical standards (Graph 63). The issuance, by both financial institutions and supranational/government entities, was split fairly evenly between the domestic and offshore markets. ", " Total issuance of bonds in the domestic market by all non-government borrowers (including non-residents) was $35 billion in the first half of 2004, substantially more than in any previous six-month period. Outstandings of non-government debt have increased by $13 billion to $164 billion, while the amounts outstanding of both Commonwealth Government bonds ($53 billion) and state government bonds ($54 billion) are little changed <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 64)</span>. ", " Net equity raisings totalled $5.3 billion in the June quarter (Graph 65). Equity raised through IPOs in the quarter was particularly strong at $3.5 billion, and was second only to the December quarter of 2003. Around 35 companies listed in the quarter, with half of these from the materials and consumer discretionary sectors. Just two companies accounted for more than half of the value of equity raised through IPOs during the quarter, with the median amount raised being $12 million. <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a> outlines some of the reasons for the recent strength in IPO activity. The strength of total equity raisings was tempered to some extent by raisings other than IPOs being below the average levels of recent years, and buybacks being above average. ", " The cash rate has remained at 5.25 per cent since the increases of 25 basis points each in November and December last year. It is now 100 basis points above its trough in 2001 and 2002, but the current level remains below its average over the past decade. Taken together with the continued strong borrowing activity of both households and businesses, this suggests that monetary policy is still mildly accommodative. ", " Growth in total credit slowed in the first half of 2004, with annualised growth of 13 per cent over the six months to June, compared with a peak rate of 18 per cent over the second half of 2003 (Table 16). This slowing is mostly accounted for by business credit. ", " The pace of household credit growth has moderated a little, with annualised growth of 18 per cent over the half-year to June, compared with a rate of 21¼ per cent over the previous half-year. However, this rate of growth is still unsustainable relative to growth in households' capacity to service the debt, which is mainly determined by growth in household incomes. The continued strength is due to growth in both housing credit and in other forms of personal credit, including margin lending and drawdowns on home equity loans for non-housing purposes (see ‘<a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>’ for more discussion on margin lending). Borrowing for housing has slowed modestly from the very high rates of the second half of last year, but it remains very strong, with annualised growth of 18½ per cent over the past half-year. This continued strong growth is in line with housing loan approvals, which have also come down somewhat from the peak of $15 billion per month in October 2003, but then stabilised in the first five months of 2004 at around $12½ billion per month. Loan approvals to investors have fallen more noticeably than those to owner-occupiers, but lending to investors still remains high by historical standards (see the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic Conditions</a>’ for a more detailed discussion). Given that the level of loan approvals tends to lead credit growth, further falls in loan approvals would have to occur before housing credit growth could be expected to return to a more sustainable pace. ", " Growth in business credit has been lower than that for household credit, and quite volatile. After contracting over the three months to March, business credit grew at a solid pace in the June quarter, bringing its annual growth rate to around 8½ per cent over the year to June. Overall, firms appear to continue to have ready access to finance from both internal and external sources. ", " The continued strength in borrowing suggests that households and businesses do not find current financial conditions to be restrictive, notwithstanding the increases in interest rates late last year. Along with the cash rate, other variable and fixed lending rates are still below their averages of the past decade, and have remained largely unchanged over 2004 to date (Graph 66). ", " Ten-year bond yields in early August were around 25 basis points below the level at the time of the last <em>Statement</em> (Graph 67). The slope of the yield curve – as measured by the yield on 10-year bonds less the cash rate – was 45 basis points in early August, which is less steep than implied by the average differential from 1995 of around 95 basis points. This measure can be interpreted as an indicator of the stance of policy, and might suggest that policy is less expansionary than indicated by growth in credit or the level of borrowing rates. However, it is likely that it is being held down by the influence on Australian bond yields of foreign yields, which remain at low levels due to the accommodative policy in the major economies. ", " As of early August, the Australian dollar had depreciated by around 3 per cent on a trade-weighted basis since the time of the May <em>Statement</em>, to be around 9 per cent below its February peak. Although the real exchange rate remains well above its post-float average, this coincides with a number of factors that have been favourable to the tradables sector. The terms of trade have grown strongly in recent quarters, to be at their highest level since the mid 1970s (Graph 68). The strengthening in global demand is also contributing to a more favourable environment for Australia's exporters. ", " The Consumer Price Index rose by 0.5 per cent in the June quarter to be 2.5 per cent higher over the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 69)</span>. The profile for inflation over the past year has, however, been affected by fluctuations in petrol prices; these depressed the CPI in the June quarter 2003 but have subsequently risen strongly. Consequently, as that quarter has dropped out of the current annual figure, the year-ended rate has increased. Excluding petrol prices, the CPI rose by 2.1 per cent over the year (Table 17). The Bank's assessment, based on a range of different measures, is that the annual rate of underlying inflation is still running at around 2 per cent, or a little above. ", " The divergence between tradable and non-tradable inflation persists (Graph 70). However, this gap is likely to have passed its maximum, with the effect of the appreciation of 2002–2003 beginning to wane. Following a run of sizeable falls, prices of tradables (excluding petrol and food) rose by 0.2 per cent in the quarter, though they fell over the year by 1.4 per cent. ", " Inflation of non-tradable items remained quite firm. Overall, the price of non-tradables rose by 0.7 per cent in the June quarter and by 4.1 per cent over the year. Housing costs continued to rise noticeably, making one of the largest contributions to growth in non-tradables prices. House purchase costs rose by 1.4 per cent in the quarter and by 5.3 per cent over the year. Liaison suggests that these increases are being driven in part by labour shortages and higher materials costs. The latest quarterly increase in the price of non-tradables was also partly due to increases in the cost of private health insurance, which caused overall health prices to rise by 3.1 per cent in the quarter, and by 6.6 per cent over the year. ", " Indices of producer prices similarly show that the sharp contrast between domestic and external sources of inflation diminished slightly in the June quarter. While domestically sourced inflation remained firm, the depreciation between March and June contributed to an increase in imported producer prices for the first time since late 2002, partly reversing the declines that had been evident for the past eighteen months (Graph 71). In addition, higher crude oil prices also induced rises in producer prices at each stage of production, with costs rising for firms that use either oil or oil-intensive inputs to production. Reflecting these developments, some upstream inflationary pressures have emerged, with prices at preliminary and intermediate stages of production increasing sharply in the quarter (Table 18). ", " While oil prices played a prominent role, at the final stage of production, construction costs made the largest contribution to prices growth. Liaison suggests that pressures on construction costs remain significant. The Davis Langdon Tender Price Index – which prices a fixed basket of labour and material inputs typically used in commercial and apartment construction – confirms this, though pressures are now abating in some regions, particularly Melbourne (Graph 72). ", " The wage cost index (WCI) for total hourly pay increased by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter, to be <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span> higher than a year earlier (Graph 73). This outcome for the WCI was lower than expected, though the year-ended rate of increase is still higher than the average for this series. The March quarter result was held down by a slowing in public-sector wages growth in the quarter, as the effects of some earlier amendments to state government awards abated, and by benign wage outcomes in several large industries, such as manufacturing and property &amp; business services (Table 19). Inclusive of bonus payments, however, a number of industries have recorded more buoyant wages growth, particularly those where labour market conditions are tight. Furthermore, liaison suggests that bonus payments are becoming more prevalent. ", " Most other labour cost indicators point to a continuance of wages growth around current rates or hint at a modest pick-up. According to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, the average annualised wage increase certified in new enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) edged up to 4.1 per cent in the March quarter from 4.0 per cent in December, with the increase mainly due to higher wage outcomes in the public sector; outcomes in the private sector eased slightly in the quarter. The average wage increase for the stock of existing agreements in March remained at 3.9 per cent. Business surveys also report firm wages growth. The NAB Quarterly Business Survey recorded 0.6 per cent growth in labour costs in the June quarter and it foreshadows a similar pace in the September quarter. Year-ended growth in labour costs is now around 3 per cent – slightly stronger than recorded earlier in the year. In contrast, after increasing steadily since early 2003, the Mercer Quarterly Salary Review reported that annual growth in the base salaries of executives slowed in the June quarter to 4.3 per cent. ", " While growth in standard measures of aggregate earnings remains reasonably well contained, these measures do not include the rates paid to subcontractors. For some industries where use of subcontractors is common, the current firmness in the labour market is being reflected in more pronounced growth in labour costs. Furthermore, these labour cost pressures are becoming more prominent in both the goods and services sectors and are extending to less-skilled workers. ", " Most measures of inflation expectations suggest that observers expect mild inflation outcomes in the near term before a modest increase in inflation over the next two years, with some convergence in views about this longer-term outlook now evident (Table 20). Financial market economists surveyed by the Bank have lowered slightly their median expectation of inflation for the year ahead – given that the June quarter CPI was slightly lower than anticipated by the markets – while they expect inflation to rise from current rates over a longer horizon. Union officials continue to predict a more stable profile for inflation than market economists; while they have revised up their near-term inflation expectations a little, they see no additional increase in inflation beyond the coming year. The inflation expectations of union officials do, however, remain higher than those of financial market economists over the whole forecast period. ", " The various business surveys present a consistent view that inflation expectations have risen from their low base, though they remain below long-run average levels. Both the quarterly NAB business survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported that inflationary pressures have increased in the June quarter, with firms reporting a rise in actual and expected selling prices. Manufacturers surveyed by the AIG also indicated that selling prices rose significantly in the June quarter, with these increases attributed to higher costs for fuel and other commodities. ", " In contrast, among consumers, inflation expectations are little changed in recent months, despite the prominence of news about higher oil prices. The Melbourne Institute reported that the median expectation for consumer price inflation over the coming year rose marginally to 4.4 per cent in July, unwinding the previous month's decline <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 74)</span>. Looking through the volatility in this series, expectations have been stable in recent years. ", " Similarly, the expectations of financial market participants are currently little changed from the time of the last <em>Statement</em>. Longer-term expectations, as measured by the difference between nominal and indexed 10-year bond yields, rose somewhat in the June quarter, before declining back to around 2.5 per cent over July. These movements appear, in part, to be a response of nominal bond yields to developments in world bond markets rather than signalling a lack of change in the financial market's view of the inflation outlook. ", " The Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation remains a little above 2 per cent. The overall decline in inflation from its peak early last year has reflected the ongoing effects of the large appreciation of 2002–2003. These effects are likely to continue to hold down inflation in the near term, so that underlying inflation is likely to remain close to 2 per cent over the remainder of this year. However, as this disinflationary impulse from the earlier appreciation dissipates, the inflation rate is expected to increase to around 2½ per cent by the end of 2005, and could subsequently go higher if the current strength in the domestically sourced component of inflation persists. ", " CPI inflation will probably follow a slightly different profile. In the near term, prevailing high oil prices and rising prices for some publicly administered items will keep the headline rate of inflation above most underlying measures by up to ½ percentage point. This gap should gradually narrow until the middle of next year, as the impetus from oil prices is expected to abate and tariffs are lowered on certain items. From the middle of next year, it is likely that both the CPI and underlying inflation will follow similar paths, and move higher together. ", " One risk to this outlook is the price of oil. The Bank's forecast is based on an assumption that the oil price gradually falls to US$32 per barrel (or around its five-year average in SDR terms). The marked strengthening of the world economy and recent disruptions to global oil supply suggest that this reversion may not occur, or may be slower than anticipated. If that proves to be the case, fuel prices in Australia would persist at a higher level. There is also the broader risk that a tightening oil market could induce higher world prices and so put upward pressure on the prices of various imported goods and services, possibly altering inflation expectations. ", " The domestically focused risks to the inflation outlook remain slightly tilted to the upside. Demand pressures could develop in a way that places upward pressure on a range of domestic prices and costs. Labour market conditions remain quite firm, and there is a possibility that continued strength in demand for labour could push wages growth above that currently envisaged. However, to date, wage pressures have been well contained, and could indicate a less pronounced sensitivity of wages growth to demand conditions than suggested by historical experience. ", "In February 2004, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) required banks to limit their exposure to the property sector to a maximum of 30 per cent of outstanding loans.", "In April 2004, the State Council increased capital funding requirements by requiring larger <span class=\"no-wrap\">cash deposits</span>, and ordered that no new applications for steel, aluminium or cement projects be approved for the remainder of the year.", "In May 2004 the People's Bank of China (PBOC), CBRC, and State Development Reform Commission (SDRC) issued a joint statement directing banks to limit lending to industries that may be subject to over-investment. The CBRC has also directed banks to cease funding fixed-asset investment projects that have not obtained government approval.", "On a number of occasions over the past year, the PBOC has sought to influence the lending behaviour of commercial banks via ‘window guidance’ whereby it meets directly with banks to seek co-operation in achieving its policy goals.", " The current period of growth in Japan is the third cyclical upswing since the bursting of the asset-price bubble in the early 1990s. The two previous upswings, in the mid and late 1990s, proved to be short-lived, with ongoing balance-sheet stress weighing on the performance of Japanese businesses. It is not possible to predict the course of the current upswing but there are a number of signs that the prospects of a durable recovery are better now than they were on the two previous occasions. One indication of this is that, unlike the brief episodes of growth in the 1990s, the current expansion is more broadly based and less reliant on public expenditure. Instead, it is being driven by a combination of private consumption, business investment and exports. The current period of growth has been characterised by improved conditions in the corporate sector, where profits increased by 20 per cent over the year to March 2004, reflecting strong external demand and greater efforts to control costs. This compares with an average annual decline in aggregate profits of nearly 3 per cent between 1990 and 2002. Firms (including larger financial institutions) are also better placed to withstand future shocks given the ongoing progress in balance-sheet repair. ", " One of the important elements of the corporate restructuring process over the past few years has been the reduction in labour costs. This has been achieved by significant labour shedding, as firms overturned the traditional system of full-time and lifetime employment (Graph A1). Most notable has been the 30 per cent decline in manufacturing employment since its peak in 1992 – a fall that is twice the magnitude of the decline in the US and the euro area over the same period. Aggregate employment has also declined over this period, though by a much smaller amount. Associated with this, there was a sharp slowing in the growth of labour compensation, further helping to contain costs. Compensation per employee in real terms had still been rising consistently up to 1998, but since then the trend has been relatively flat. There are signs, however, that labour market conditions are improving during the current economic expansion, with aggregate employment rising since late last year and a steady decline in measures of excess labour. ", " Another key element of the corporate restructuring process has been the increased repayment of outstanding debt. Notwithstanding the adverse impact of deflation, the ratio of corporate debt to GDP has fallen from a peak of 116 per cent in 1995 to 89 per cent – its lowest level since 1987 (Graph A2). Coupled with the reduction in interest rates and the recent recovery in profits – which are up about 40 per cent since their recent low in late 2001 – this has brought the debt-servicing burden down from a peak of <span class=\"no-wrap\">77 per cent</span> of operating profits in 1993 to 17 per cent in the March quarter 2004. Still, corporate leverage remains high by international standards and further adjustment is likely, especially among the more highly geared smaller non-manufacturing firms. ", " Balance-sheet restructuring is also apparent within the banking sector, particularly with regard to non-performing loans. Despite a decline in the level of bank lending, official estimates suggest that non-performing loans have fallen from a peak of 8½ per cent of bank lending in 2002 to a little under <span class=\"no-wrap\">6 per cent</span>, the result of a decline in new non-performing loans, and disposal of existing non-performing loans. Bank profitability has also risen, following a rise in the valuation of equity holdings, lower loan loss provisioning and further reductions in operating costs. Even so, considerable scope remains for improvement, with core operating profitability relatively weak (at only 0.8 per cent of assets for the major banks). ", " While the Japanese corporate sector has made significant progress in cleaning up its balance sheet in recent years, there remain impediments to the restructuring process. In particular, generalised deflation persists, though its pace has eased, and property prices are still falling. Data from the Japanese Real Estate Institute show that land prices nationwide fell by about 8 per cent over the year to the March quarter. As land remains an important component of collateral, this continues to discourage banks from lending. Nevertheless, there are a few tentative signs of a turnaround in the property market, including a rise in equity prices of real estate companies relative to the overall share market. ", " In 2003 and early 2004, economic growth in China accelerated to the point where the Chinese authorities were concerned that the economy was overheating. Consequently they adopted measures aimed at slowing growth to a more sustainable pace. Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese financial system, the policy approach adopted has differed from that used in most OECD economies, where short-term interest rates are the predominant financial macro-stabilisation tool. Efforts have focused largely on administrative and liquidity controls, which aim to slow investment through influencing the provision of credit. ", " In late 2003 the authorities undertook a number of measures aimed at reducing the liquidity in the economy, including increased issuance of central bank bills and increases in reserve ratios for banks. These have been supplemented more recently by a number of administrative measures. The authorities have sought to restrain bank lending in particular sectors of the economy including property, steel, cement, and aluminium, where they feel that the pace of growth is unsustainable. ", " To date interest rates have only had a limited role, with the key base lending rate (the one-year working capital rate) and the deposit rate unchanged since February 2002, at 5.31 per cent and 0.72 per cent respectively. There have, however, been minor adjustments to several other interest rates, with the PBOC increasing the ceiling on bank lending rates to 1.7 times the base lending rate (9.03 per cent) in <span class=\"no-wrap\">January 2004</span>, allowing banks to charge higher rates to borrowers. The previous ceiling had been 1.3 times the base lending rate for small enterprises, and 1.1 times the base lending rate for medium to large enterprises. In March the PBOC increased the interest rate ceiling on loans to commercial banks and for rediscounting trade bills. ", " Thus far, the measures look to have had some effect. Growth in bank lending has slowed from 24 per cent in the year to August 2003, to 16 per cent in the year to June 2004, while M2 growth has slowed from <span class=\"no-wrap\">22 per cent to 16 per cent</span> over the same period (Graph B1). ", " Following relatively subdued growth over 2002/03, margin lending for equities and managed funds has picked up strongly over the past year; the level of margin debt outstanding (including protected financing) increased by 23 per cent over the year to June 2004, to reach $13.7 billion (Graph C1).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fnc1\" id=\"rc1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> The pick-up in margin lending has been supported by the recovery in the share market, and may also reflect a decline in the appeal of property investment. Despite its recent strength, however, margin lending is still small compared with other forms of household borrowing, accounting for around 13 per cent of non-housing personal debt and 2 per cent of total household debt. ", " Much of the recent pick-up in margin lending is likely to have reflected increases in existing borrowers' debt levels, with the number of margin loan accounts rising more modestly over the period. As such, the average size of outstanding margin loans has increased markedly, from around $83,000 in March 2003 to almost $100,000 at present, which is the highest level since the survey's inception in 1999. ", " Although the level of margin debt has increased strongly over the past year, the value of assets securing the loans has risen more rapidly – helped by the strong performance of the Australian share market – and as a result the average leverage ratio has fallen to around its lowest level in two years (Graph C2). Average credit limit usage has also remained low during the past year. Together, these observations suggest that borrowers are, on average, being relatively cautious, perhaps mindful of earlier episodes of higher market volatility and more frequent margin calls. ", " As at June 2004, direct holdings of Australian shares comprised 70 per cent of the assets underlying margin loans (up from around 60 per cent in 2002), with managed fund investments making up most of the remainder. Around 68 per cent of outstanding margin debt was at variable interest rates, with the predominant rate currently around 8 per cent. The remaining debt is at fixed rates with most of this in the form of loans on which interest has been prepaid (usually up to 12 months in advance). As interest on margin loans is tax deductible, prepayment enables investors to bring forward the tax deduction – which may be particularly beneficial near the end of the financial year – and typically also entitles them to a small discount on the usual fixed rate. Reflecting these possible advantages, growth in margin lending tends to be higher, and a greater share of new loans have interest prepaid, in the June quarter of each year. ", " The recent strength in margin lending may also reflect competition between margin lenders which has seen the introduction of new products and additional features and flexibility in existing products. For example, while it has always been possible for people to finance share investments by borrowing against their houses, some margin lenders have recently begun offering products which effectively combine a home equity loan with a traditional margin loan. While these products may provide a further means for investors to diversify their asset base, by increasing the overall leverage of the investment they have the potential to magnify both gains and losses, and hence present a greater risk to investors. Many margin loan providers now also offer geared savings plans, where the borrower's own periodic savings are combined with increases in the margin loan to purchase additional shares or managed fund investments. ", " The past year has seen a relatively high level of IPO activity on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Since end June 2003, more new companies have listed on the ASX than during any previous 12-month period aside from the ‘dot.com’ related wave of IPO activity during late 1999 and 2000 (Graph D1). In terms of the value of equity capital raised through primary offerings (excluding privatisations and demutualisations), the past financial year has been the strongest on record. ", " The increase in IPO activity in late 1999 and 2000 corresponded with the height of the dot.com boom <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph D2)</span>. The jump in the number of IPOs during this period was primarily due to IT and IT-related IPOs and came after IT share prices more than doubled in the first half of 1999. IT share prices peaked in March 2000 at almost eight times their end 1998 level and fell sharply thereafter, reverting to their end 1998 level by end 2002. The drop-off in IPO activity was just as pronounced, with very few IT companies having listed since 2001. ", " The pick-up in IPO activity in the second half of 2003 corresponded with a turnaround in global equity markets and a more optimistic global economic outlook. The increase in listings was in part driven by listings of materials companies, particularly mining companies (Graph D3). The strength in mining IPOs reflected strong increases in US dollar commodity prices and in demand from China, and significant increases in resource company share prices. Other sectors that have participated in the recent wave of IPOs include the health care, financials (primarily property trusts and listed investment companies) and consumer discretionary sectors. ", " As with IT companies during the dot.com boom, mining companies have accounted for more than one-third of total listings during the past year. However, the growth in the number of listed mining companies is nowhere near as pronounced: the 54 recently listed mining companies comprise around 15 per cent by number of all listed mining companies and a very small share of their market capitalisation. Moreover, the rise in resource companies' share prices, although strong, has been much less than that of IT stocks during the dot.com boom. ", " Many of the recently-listed mining stocks are start-up companies with little or no earnings history, and some are not currently profitable. The speculative nature of some of these companies is further highlighted by the wide variation in the performance of their share prices since listing: the prices of several have almost tripled, while others have lost around two-thirds of their value. By end June, the median return on issue price for mining companies that have listed during the past year was −19 per cent and the weighted average return (based on the amount raised in the IPO) was −4 per cent. Less than one-quarter of new mining company listings have outperformed the All Ordinaries index since their issue. This is somewhat below the historical performance of mining IPOs. ", " It should be noted, however, that the share price performance of other companies that have listed in the past year has also been varied (Graph D4). By end June, the median non-mining company was 1 per cent higher than its issue price, and the weighted average return on issue price was 6 per cent. About half of recently-listed non-mining companies have outperformed the All Ordinaries index since listing. This is in line with the average post-listing performance.

In the US a broadly based recovery is now in its fourth year, and it has been accompanied by a gradual upward drift in core inflation. The rapid expansion in China has shown little sign of abating and other parts of non-Japan east Asia have generally been experiencing satisfactory growth. In contrast, the performance of the Japanese and euro area economies over the past year has been disappointing. Overall, while the world expansion remains geographically uneven, most official and private-sector forecasts at this stage are that world growth will continue at an above-average pace this year, though not as strongly as in 2004. ", " The Australian economy has for some time been operating with strong demand conditions and a high level of capacity utilisation. The December quarter national accounts continued the pattern of previous quarters, showing weak growth in GDP alongside above-trend growth in domestic demand. The outcome for GDP growth contrasted with a number of other indicators – in particular the rapid growth in employment and the favourable conditions reported in business surveys – which suggested that the economy had been growing strongly during 2004. As is often the case, it is not possible to find a neat reconciliation of these various sources of information. Nonetheless, it is clear from the national accounts that demand growth remained faster than average during 2004 but that, to a large extent, this was met by rising imports and declining inventories rather than by commensurate growth in output. This pattern is consistent with other indications that the economy has been operating at a level closer to full capacity than for some time, and that supply has been unable to keep pace with the growth of demand. A consequence of the gap between spending and production growth over recent years has been a widening of Australia's current account deficit, although other factors are also likely to have contributed including an appreciation of the exchange rate. ", " Indicators of economic conditions so far in 2005 suggest that the combination of firm demand conditions and high capacity utilisation continued in the early months of the year. The labour market remained firm in the March quarter, with employment posting further large increases and the unemployment rate remaining at its lowest level since the 1970s. Figures for retail sales showed a pick-up in the March quarter and other indicators of consumer demand such as motor vehicle sales and imports of consumer goods were up strongly in the quarter. Business surveys in the March quarter indicated softer conditions, though they generally remained well above average. The surveys also continued to report that businesses have been operating at high levels of capacity utilisation. In these circumstances it is not surprising that business investment has contributed strongly to the overall growth in demand during the past year, and indicators of investment intentions suggest that it will continue to do so. ", " An important influence on the economy at present is the boost to domestic income flowing from rising international commodity prices, particularly for mineral resources. Rising export prices boosted Australia's terms of trade by around 10 per cent during 2004, and a similar increase is likely to be recorded during 2005 as the recent round of increases in bulk commodity contract prices takes effect. This represents an important source of stimulus for the economy, with the current run-up in the terms of trade being the largest since the early 1970s. The rising terms of trade will boost demand and activity through a number of channels, including by providing ongoing encouragement to investment activity in the resources sector. ", " Much of the information on the domestic economy at this stage predates the March decision to increase the cash rate. Information on the impact of the cash rate increase is still quite limited, although there are some early signs that it is starting to have a dampening influence on demand. Consumer sentiment according to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey declined sharply in March, and showed only a slight pick-up in April. To keep this in perspective, sentiment is still above average, having come down from near-record levels earlier in the year. In the business sector, the monthly NAB survey indicated that conditions declined a bit further in March. In the housing market, the indications are that conditions have remained subdued in recent weeks. Overall, while the available evidence is still tentative, it is possible that the most recent tightening could have a larger short-term impact on spending and sentiment than has typically been the case in the past. ", " Drawing these various pieces of information together there is some evidence to suggest that domestic demand is now in the process of slowing from the above-average pace seen in 2004. However, given the generally favourable environment for business investment and ongoing stimulus to incomes from the rising terms of trade, any slowing in demand from last year's pace at this stage seems likely to be relatively mild. ", " Financial markets have undergone a substantial change in direction during the period since the February <em>Statement</em>, notwithstanding the generally positive global outlook described above. The change in sentiment was evident most clearly in equity markets though to some extent also in money and bond markets. During February and early March, rising confidence about growth prospects for the world economy was reflected in further strength in global equity markets. Thereafter, however, market sentiment began to weaken on concerns that the further step-up in oil prices would hold back world economic growth. These concerns were subsequently reinforced by some US data releases which, while solid, were less than the rather optimistic expectations embodied in market prices. World equity markets, including the Australian market, have since weakened by around 5 per cent. These market fluctuations may, of course, represent an over-reaction to short-term movements in the economic data, but it is possible that they are signalling some genuine easing in the pace of global expansion since the March quarter. ", " Global bond yields also rose over the February/March period but, like share markets, have since retreated. The Federal Reserve has continued on its well-telegraphed path of gradually normalising interest rates, with tightenings in March and early May. In Australia, the early March tightening, which lifted the cash rate by 25 basis points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5.5 per cent</span>, had been fully anticipated and its announcement caused little reaction in markets. Expectations of a further rate rise persisted for a time but have since receded, in line with the broader change in market sentiment. ", " Increases in global commodity prices, combined with strong demand conditions domestically and capacity constraints in some parts of the economy, have contributed to significant upstream price pressures in Australia during the past year. This was particularly evident in the second half of 2004, when producer price indices accelerated at all stages of production. In the March quarter these pressures appeared to ease off somewhat. Nonetheless, over the past year rapid increases in producer prices have been observed in areas that are closest to capacity limits, notably in the construction sector, and in products that are highly sensitive to rising raw materials costs such as steel and plastics. ", " Consumer price inflation has been relatively steady over recent quarters at an annual rate of around 2½ per cent. In the March quarter, the annual CPI inflation rate was 2.4 per cent, with underlying measures also close to that figure. For some time, underlying CPI inflation has been held down by the lagged effects of the exchange rate appreciation that took place during 2002 and 2003, while domestically sourced inflation has been higher. Given the pick-up in upstream prices over the past year and the waning of the drag from exchange rate effects, underlying inflation remains likely to increase gradually in the period ahead. However, if domestic demand pressures ease appreciably, it is possible that increases in upstream costs will to some extent be absorbed into profit margins rather than flowing into consumer prices. Taking these factors into account, the Bank's forecast is that underlying inflation will increase gradually from its current level to around 3 per cent by the end of next year. This is broadly the same as the forecast presented in the February <em>Statement</em>, although the upside risks to this forecast identified in February may have receded. In the short term, headline CPI inflation will be pushed higher than underlying measures by the recent increases in petrol prices. ", " Financial conditions at this stage do not seem to have been inhibiting the growth of credit and spending, although it is too early yet for the available credit data to reflect any impact from the recent policy tightening. The March tightening, in conjunction with earlier adjustments in 2002 and 2003, has brought the cash rate to a level that is broadly in line with its average over the low-inflation period since the early 1990s. Interest rates of financial intermediaries are still a little below average, as a result of margin compression during that period. Over recent months household credit growth has been fairly steady at around 1 per cent per month, or an annual rate of around 13 per cent, which is still strong by historical standards though down from the peak reached in 2003. At the same time, business credit growth has been gradually strengthening. ", " The Board's decision to increase the cash rate in March was taken against the background of strong demand pressures combined with a significant pick-up in upstream prices during the second half of 2004. As had been set out in the February <em>Statement</em>, consumer price inflation was forecast to increase gradually to the top of the target band, with the risks to that forecast judged to be weighted to the upside. ", " The information becoming available since March has provided some limited evidence that demand pressures are now easing, though whether this will be sufficient to contain inflation to an acceptable level still remains to be seen. At its April meeting the Board considered the case for a further tightening but decided to wait for additional information on inflation and for early indications of the impact of the March decision. In the event, March quarter prices data indicated that upstream price pressures had eased somewhat and that consumer price inflation remained relatively contained. Other information taken into account at the time of the May meeting included the shift in sentiment in financial markets. At the same time, it was recognised that the global expansion and rising terms of trade would provide ongoing support to the Australian economy in the period ahead. ", " The Board's assessment of this information at its May meeting was that inflation remained likely to increase gradually from its current level of around 2½ per cent, but that upside risks to this forecast had receded, partly as a result of the March tightening. This assessment of course remains subject to review as new information becomes available. Based on previous cyclical experience, it would be surprising if interest rates did not have to increase further at some stage of the current expansion. Nonetheless, given the tentative signs of easing in domestic demand pressures, the Board judged that there was a case to hold the cash rate steady for the time being, to allow further time to assess the strength of inflationary pressures. The Board will continue to monitor developments and make adjustments to the policy setting as required to ensure that Australia's economic expansion is not jeopardised by rising inflation. ", " The global economic expansion continues, and while the pace has eased since last year, the latest IMF forecasts are for world growth to remain comfortably above trend in both 2005 and 2006 (Table 1). The expansion remains geographically uneven, with disappointing growth in the euro area and Japan being offset by strength elsewhere, particularly in the US and China. However, world GDP growth is expected to become more synchronised in 2006 as activity increases in both the euro area and Japan. ", " The strength in global growth has been associated with a rapid expansion of trade and sharp increases in commodity prices and freight charges (for further details see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A: Developments in World Trade</a>’). The pick-up in oil prices has been especially noteworthy, with the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil rising to a new daily record of over US$57 per barrel in April, before falling back to around US$50 per barrel in early May (Graph 1). The strength in oil prices over the past year is a reflection of tight supply and strength in global demand, and the increases that occurred in 2004 so far appear to have had only a modest negative impact on global activity and relatively limited effects on inflation. However, recent movements in long-dated futures prices suggest market participants believe the recent run-up in oil prices will be more persistent than they did six months ago. Futures prices generally move somewhat in response to changes in the spot price, even when movements in the latter are driven by transitory factors, but their substantially lower volatility suggests that they are more anchored to longer-run price fundamentals than are spot prices. While spot prices in April were at levels comparable to those seen in October 2004, long-dated futures prices were close to US$10 per barrel higher than in October last year, at around US$48. ", " The strong economic growth of recent years has continued into 2005. Real GDP increased by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter, to be 3.6 per cent higher over the year (Graph 2). Demand growth in the quarter was driven by consumption and equipment investment; some of this demand was met from abroad, as imports continued to expand at a faster pace than exports. ", " There has been ongoing improvement in the labour market, with an average of around 160,000 jobs added per month since mid 2004, somewhat above trend growth in the labour force (Graph 3). The unemployment rate fell to 5.2 per cent in March, down from a peak of 6.3 per cent in mid 2003. Nonetheless, it is likely that considerable slack remains in the labour market, with the participation rate remaining well below the level of earlier years and little sign of upward pressure on wages. Forward indicators of the labour market remain reasonably positive. Initial jobless claims are around 320,000, a level usually associated with monthly employment gains of more than 200,000, and the employment components of the ISM surveys report healthy labour demand. ", " Consistent with the continued labour market recovery, consumption growth remained robust at 0.9 per cent in the March quarter, and 3.6 per cent over the year. Consumption was also supported by an increase in household net wealth in the December quarter of 4.2 per cent, driven by a substantial increase in the value of equities and rapid growth in house prices. Consumer sentiment remains around long-run average levels, despite declining a little recently. ", " Conditions in the business sector remain positive, with most measures of business sentiment remaining above trend. Corporate profits are very large as a share of GDP, having increased by 13.5 per cent in the December quarter, after being adversely affected in the previous quarter by hurricane-related losses (Graph 4). Combined with low gearing and favourable external financing conditions, this has underpinned a substantial increase in business investment of 11.1 per cent over the year to the March quarter, with particularly strong growth in investment in ITC equipment. Growth in core capital goods orders and shipments remains solid, pointing to continued growth in equipment investment in the period ahead. ", " The robust pace of spending by US households and businesses saw the current account deficit widen further in the December quarter, reaching 6.3 per cent of GDP. This trend continued in the March quarter, as import volumes grew by 3.5 per cent and export volumes by 1.7 per cent. ", " Core inflation has drifted higher over the past year, as slowing productivity growth has pushed up growth in unit labour costs, albeit from a very low level. Having reached a trough of around 1 per cent in late 2003, core CPI inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy components) increased to 2.3 per cent over the year to March (Graph 5). Core inflation as measured by the chain price index for personal consumption expenditure was more subdued, at around 1¾ per cent over the year to March. Upstream price pressures have increased; producer prices are rising strongly and the prices component of the manufacturing ISM survey has increased sharply in recent months. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve has continued its process of normalising interest rates, raising the funds rate by 25 basis points in both March and May, bringing the rate to 3.0 per cent. ", " The Japanese recovery lost momentum during 2004, with real GDP contracting for a period and growing by only 1.0 per cent over the year as a whole (Graph 6). Some of this faltering in growth can be attributed to special factors, such as the typhoons and earthquake that occurred in late 2004. Part of the slowing has also been associated with the downturn in the global ITC cycle in the second half of 2004. It is possible, however, that the national accounts data are overstating the weakening of the economy, given their susceptibility to extensive revision, and the fact that other indicators show greater strength. ", " Industrial production increased by 2.1 per cent over the year to March, with solid growth in production in non-ITC sectors offsetting weakness in ITC goods. But while the ITC downturn has tempered growth in production and export volumes, the outlook for overall economic activity is reasonably positive, with business investment in particular likely to strengthen. Business sentiment indicators, such as the PMI and the Shoko Chukin survey, have improved since the start of the year and are at above-average levels, and firms report high rates of capacity utilisation (Graph 7). Machinery orders rose strongly in February and growth in capital goods shipments remains solid. The corporate sector appears to be well-placed to fund ongoing capital spending, with corporate profits increasing by 13 per cent over the year to the December quarter and profit margins at their highest level in over a decade. ", " The outlook for household spending is also positive. Retail sales and consumer goods shipments have increased solidly in the latest quarter, and consumer confidence is relatively high, underpinned by more favourable employment prospects. Employment continues to expand at a modest pace, with payrolls up by 0.5 per cent over the year to March. Leading indicators of employment suggest further growth in the near term. The ratio of job offers to applicants and hiring intentions from various business surveys are at high levels. And while the downward drift in Japan's unemployment rate partly reflects the reduced participation of an aging population, at 4.5 per cent in March, the unemployment rate was at its lowest level in the past six years, consistent with increases in labour demand. ", " Deflationary pressures persist, though the GDP deflator suggests that they have lessened, with the year-ended rate of deflation easing from 1.7 per cent in the June quarter to 0.4 per cent in the December quarter. Consumer prices (excluding fresh food) fell by 0.3 per cent over the year to March; while this follows a period in which consumer prices had been stable, one-off factors that raised prices earlier have dropped out of the year-ended calculation. The influence of high prices for oil and other commodities is evident in the domestic corporate goods prices index, which was 1.4 per cent higher over the year to March. ", " The Chinese economy continues to advance at a rapid pace, providing significant impetus to growth in the rest of the east Asian region. Real GDP grew by 9.5 per cent over the year to the March quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of above 9 per cent growth, despite the authorities' continuing efforts to moderate and rebalance growth. ", " Activity indicators also point to continued strong growth. Industrial production expanded by 15.1 per cent over the year to March, up from 14.4 per cent over the year to December (Graph 8). Retail sales growth remains buoyant, at 13.9 per cent over the year to March, underpinned by strong growth in per capita incomes, with rural incomes boosted by higher prices for agricultural goods. And despite the notable easing in credit and money supply growth, to around 14 per cent over the year to March, growth of fixed asset investment remains very high, at 26 per cent over the same period. The authorities are aiming to slow investment growth to around <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span> in 2005. Even at this rate, the investment-to-GDP ratio will continue climbing to almost 50 per cent this year. ", " China's current account surplus has widened from 1½ per cent of GDP in 2001 to around 4 per cent of GDP in 2004. In the past few months, the trade surplus has widened significantly, as export growth remained rapid, at <span class=\"no-wrap\">33 per cent</span> over the year to March, while import growth slowed to 19 per cent over the same period. Some of this easing in China's import growth may reflect reduced reliance on imports owing to the substantial expansion of China's manufacturing capacity in industries such as steel, automobiles and ITC. Notably, China's ITC trade surplus has swelled in recent months, as China moves from being a cheap assembly point for imported components to playing a larger role in the production process. ", " Upstream price pressures have subsided to some extent, with year-ended growth in the corporate goods price index of 3.5 per cent in March, down from 9.6 per cent in September last year. However, the recent large rises in world commodity prices may revive inflationary pressure, along with the emerging wage pressure in the major coastal regions where labour shortages exist. Consumer price inflation was 2.7 per cent over the year to March, up from 2.4 per cent in December. Excluding food, consumer price inflation is drifting higher, though it remains modest at around 1¼ per cent. Property prices rose by 9.8 per cent over the year to the March quarter, and there are signs of overheating in property markets on the eastern seaboard. The authorities have expressed concern about speculative activity, and have raised the effective minimum mortgage rate, and increased the minimum downpayment ratio in those cities experiencing the most rapid house price growth. ", " The pace of growth in the rest of east Asia remains solid, though it has eased somewhat from the rapid rates of a year ago. GDP for the region expanded by around 4½ per cent over the year to the December quarter. At the country level, more pronounced slowing has been evident among the major ITC producers, such as Taiwan and Singapore <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 9)</span>. Growth has been firmer among the other south-east Asian economies, while after a subdued performance in 2004, there are some tentative signs of improvement in Korea's growth outlook. ", " The contribution to growth from exports in east Asia lessened in the December quarter, in line with the downswing in the global ITC cycle. ITC goods account for a significant proportion of the region's merchandise exports, especially in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. More recently, merchandise exports have increased modestly over the three months to March, and were around 12 per cent higher over the year. The impact of the ITC downturn is even more evident in the production data, where growth has slowed to a year-ended pace of around 3½ per cent, as firms cut back ITC production in order to rein in inventories. ", " There are, however, signs that the downturn in the ITC cycle may prove to be mild, with world semiconductor sales having risen since the beginning of the year to be well above levels of a year ago (Graph 10). A key factor supporting the recent increase in sales has been an avoidance of the large run-up in inventories that occurred in the 2000–01 dot-com boom. With world semiconductor sales now rising, it appears that much of the adjustment in the ITC sector may have already occurred. ", " The outlook for domestic demand in east Asia remains favourable. High levels of capacity utilisation, reconstruction activity in the wake of the south Asian tsunami and an improved investor climate in Indonesia should underpin growth in business investment. Retail sales continue to grow in most countries, buoyed by expansionary macroeconomic policies, strongly rising asset prices and improving labour markets. The unemployment rates in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore have declined to around their lowest levels in about three years. ", " While Korea's recovery in domestic demand has lagged behind that in the rest of the region, recent developments have been more encouraging, with the process of household balance-sheet repair nearing an end. Households have reduced their indebtedness and increased their saving, and consumption growth in the December quarter was the strongest in over two years. Korea's improving prospects are also reflected in the noticeable lift in consumer and business sentiment since the beginning of the year (Graph 11). ", " Headline consumer price inflation across the region continues to be affected by the high cost of crude oil and other commodities. This will be exacerbated in coming months as the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have implemented reductions in fuel subsidies. Underlying inflation in east Asia remains relatively contained, though is trending higher. Interest rates are still low in most countries, but the central banks of Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines have raised policy rates in the past three months in response to mounting inflationary pressures. ", " In India, real GDP expanded by 6.2 per cent over 2004. Agricultural output subtracted from growth over the year as below-average rainfall reduced harvests, whereas non-farm GDP continued to expand strongly. More recently, manufacturing output has continued to grow strongly, but shortages of coal have restrained output in energy-intensive sectors so that growth in total industrial production slowed to 5 per cent over the year to February. Export growth has eased, but remains high at 23 per cent over the year to March. Price pressures have moderated in recent months, as the earlier run-up in raw materials costs has been partially unwound. The annual rate of increase in the wholesale price index eased to 5.0 per cent in March, down from the 8.7 per cent peak in August 2004. Nonetheless, the Reserve Bank of India raised its policy rate by 25 basis points in April to 5 per cent, noting high commodity prices and strong credit growth. ", " Economic growth in New Zealand remains strong, with GDP expanding by 3.9 per cent over the year to the December quarter. Growth has moderated somewhat from its rapid pace in early 2004, as activity in housing construction and consumer demand start to cool. Nonetheless, household spending continues to be supported by a strong labour market, with employment growing by 4.4 per cent over 2004 and the unemployment rate declining to an historically low 3.6 per cent. Consumer price inflation was 2.8 per cent over the year to the March quarter, near the top of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's target band. The Bank raised policy rates by a further 25 basis points in March to 6¾ per cent, citing a stronger outlook for activity in the near term and associated pressures on inflation. ", " Growth in the euro area has remained lacklustre, reflecting subdued domestic conditions and the loss of impetus from net exports. GDP growth was 0.2 per cent in the December quarter and 1.6 per cent in year-ended <span class=\"no-wrap\">terms (Table 2)</span>. Although there was a reasonable increase in domestic final demand in the quarter, stocks and net exports both fell. Performance at the country level was mixed: output contracted in Germany and Italy, while economic growth resumed in France and continued at a robust pace in Spain. ", " Industrial production in the euro area has also fallen short of expectations. Despite good growth around the turn of the year, a soft outcome in February left year-ended growth at 0.7 per cent (Graph 12). Similarly, declines in the manufacturing PMI in March and April unwound the gains in preceding months. These developments reflect the failure of domestic demand to stage a significant recovery, while export growth continues to slow, as the strong euro erodes competitiveness. Accordingly, business sentiment has declined in recent months, with most surveys now around long-run average levels. Nevertheless, the outlook for investment is positive; there was good growth in investment in the December quarter and favourable financing conditions and high corporate profitability should contribute to further increases in capital spending. ", " Household consumption was subdued in much of the euro area in the December quarter, though it picked up in France. This pattern has continued into 2005, with retail sales growing strongly in France and Spain, but remaining weak in Germany, despite the recent introduction of income tax cuts, and continuing to decline in Italy and the Netherlands. Housing market developments have been at the heart of the divergence, with a house price boom contributing to rising household wealth and an increased appetite for debt in France and Spain, while real incomes and house prices have been flat or falling in the other major euro-zone economies. Uncertainty about labour market reforms, the adequacy of pension systems and future economic conditions may also be discouraging consumers from spending, especially in Germany where these issues have received much publicity. Consumer confidence in the euro area eased in the past three months to be back around the level of October last year. The euro-wide unemployment rate has hovered just below 9 per cent over the past three months. Reflecting the sluggish labour market conditions, labour cost growth in the euro area remained low at 2.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter. ", " Inflation has remained around the ECB's 2 per cent reference level in recent months, holding steady at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.1 per cent</span> (Graph 13). Underlying inflation has declined from 1.9 per cent over the year to December to <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.6 per cent</span> over the year to March, as earlier increases in administrative costs have dropped out. The ECB has continued to hold its policy rate at 2 per cent. ", " The pace of activity in the United Kingdom has slowed since mid 2004 as the housing sector responds to the earlier tightening of monetary policy. GDP grew by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.8 per cent over the year, down from a peak of 3.6 per cent over the year to the June quarter 2004. Higher interest rates and the resultant cooling in the housing market have tempered domestic demand growth. Net exports have also weakened, with growth in exports slowing while import growth has remained firm, stimulated by the appreciation of the pound. Growth in manufacturing production has also eased. However, surveys suggest that business confidence remains at a high level, reflecting high corporate profitability. ", " The cooling in the housing market has progressed in an orderly fashion. According to the Nationwide and Halifax surveys, year-ended house price growth declined to around 8 per cent in March from 20 per cent in the middle of last year. Housing credit growth has fallen sharply in recent months, and housing equity withdrawal has declined to less than half of its peak in December 2003. Accordingly, retail sales have shown little growth since the middle of 2004. Nevertheless, consumer confidence remains high and the unemployment rate remains near generational lows. ", " Consumer price inflation has picked up over the past three months, to be 1.9 per cent over the year to March. Much of this rise is due to higher energy costs, and underlying inflation remains around 1¼ per cent. The Bank of England has held the repo rate constant at 4¾ per cent since August 2004. ", " Over the past three months, the US Federal Reserve has continued the tightening path it commenced in June 2004, raising the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at both its March and May meetings. This took the target rate to 3 per cent, up from 1 per cent a year ago (Graph 14). Until fairly recently, markets had been expecting that the Fed would maintain the 25 points per meeting tightening pace over the second half of 2005, and at one stage in March had even started to price in some moves of 50 basis points following the release of higher-than-expected CPI data. However, over April there was a noticeable shift in sentiment. Markets have scaled back their tightening expectations due to concerns that the US economy may be slowing. Currently, the Fed is expected to tighten further at only some of its remaining meetings this year. ", " The European Central Bank (ECB) has not changed monetary policy for nearly two years, leaving its refinancing rate at 2 per cent (Graph 15). With continuing weak growth in the euro area, markets do not expect the ECB to begin lifting rates for some time. Similarly the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has left monetary policy unchanged for a substantial period, with the economy experiencing only moderate economic growth and continued, albeit less pronounced, deflation. However, the decision at each of the April meetings to maintain the current policy stance – expressed as a target for banks' excess reserves – was not unanimous, adding to speculation that the target may be reduced over coming months. Such an action would be more of a technical adjustment rather than a tightening of policy. ", " The central banks in the UK and Canada, which had been tightening in 2004, have not changed policy in recent months. Markets continue to attach some probability to rate increases in both countries over coming months, particularly in the case of Canada. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its target rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent in March, taking the cumulative increase since this tightening cycle began in early 2004 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">175 basis points</span>. ", " In Asia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand tightened policy, citing inflationary pressures. Hong Kong followed its usual practice of announcing a 25 basis point rise in its cash rate following the US Federal Reserve's decisions to tighten. To address concerns about overheating in the property sector, the People's Bank of China (PBC) increased the minimum loan rate of a five-year mortgage from 5.31 per cent to 5.51 per cent. It also announced plans to increase the required deposit on property loans from 20 per cent of the loan value to 30 per cent in areas where property price growth has been deemed excessive. In Latin America, Mexico, Brazil and Chile all tightened monetary policy due to rising concerns about inflation. On the other hand, there has been a tendency towards lower interest rates in emerging Europe, with Turkey and a number of eastern European countries all easing policy due to declining inflation pressures. South Africa has also lowered interest rates in the past three months in part reflecting the large appreciation of the rand. ", " The level of bond yields in markets globally continues to be low by historical standards. While the low level of yields in Europe and Japan could perhaps be explained by the continuing subdued economic activity in these regions, most analysts have great difficulty explaining why 10-year bond yields in the US are lower now than they were a year ago, even though the Fed has tightened monetary policy by 200 basis points in the meantime. The level of yields – around 4¼ per cent at present – looks low not only on historical comparisons but also relative to normal benchmarks such as the growth rate of nominal GDP, which in the US is currently around 6 per cent (Graph 16). ", " For a while in March it looked like the puzzle of low bond yields was disappearing, as yields rose noticeably to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.65 per cent</span> after a stronger-than-expected CPI result. But the rise has since been unwound, even though the following month also recorded an elevated CPI outcome. The reason for the recent decline in yields seems to be concerns that the US economy may be slowing, due in part to the renewed run up in oil prices. ", " German yields also rose in February, though by less than Treasury yields, and have subsequently fallen back to their lowest level in the post-War period (Graph 17). Reflecting further scaling back in the outlook for economic growth in Europe, the spread between US and German 10-year bond yields has widened. Yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds have also fallen back to be close to the lowest they have been in the past eighteen months. ", " The reasons for the low level of yields, particularly in the US, have been the subject of a good deal of conjecture. Among the explanations that have been put forward are the increased credibility of central banks in controlling inflation (inflation rates remain below 3 per cent across the developed world), the low level of official interest rates in the major economies reflecting low inflation and the continuing weakness in some economies, a glut of savings on world markets particularly sourced from the Asian region, and changes to pension fund rules in some countries which are seen as biasing investments away from equities towards bonds. The fact that yields are low in the face of the large funding requirements resulting from government deficits in many major countries is seen as adding to the puzzle. ", " There are some tentative signs that investors have been scaling back their exposure to relatively risky assets <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 18)</span>. Spreads on US corporate ‘junk bonds’ have widened since the beginning of the year, mainly reflecting the downgrade by Moody's of General Motors' credit rating to just above ‘junk’ status, and the placement of Ford's credit rating under review. Spreads on B-rated junk bonds have increased by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">80 basis points</span> since early February, while spreads on emerging market sovereign debt have also widened over the past three months, led by a 40 basis point increase in Latin American spreads. Nevertheless, spreads still remain at historically low levels. ", " Reflecting concerns that the robust pace of world economic growth may not be sustained, global equity markets have fallen in recent weeks (Graph 19, Table 3). The falls on US markets have been large enough to more than erase the gains that had occurred earlier in the year. Over the past three months, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">2½ per cent</span>, while the technology-focused NASDAQ has fallen by 7 per cent. Earnings reports from US companies for the first quarter were mixed. Market sentiment was not helped by General Motors announcing its biggest quarterly loss since 1992, and by the downgrading of its credit rating. ", " In Japan, the TOPIX index has declined by 1½ per cent since the last <em>Statement</em>. Exporter stocks in particular declined in response to the perceived slowing in the global economy. The revelation that some companies had misreported earnings also raised concern about poor corporate governance. European stocks have declined over the period since the last <em>Statement</em>, though that market is still up a little in net terms for 2005 to date. ", " In line with the major markets, equity prices in emerging markets have also generally weakened in recent months. In Asia, concerns about the state of the ITC cycle contributed to the decline. A notable exception was China where stocks rose 4 per cent, supported by reports that the government may reduce its holdings in many listed companies. In Latin America, average share prices were also lower. ", " The US dollar has traded in a relatively stable range against the major currencies over the past six months, following the broad-based depreciation that began in early 2002 (Graph 20). Concerns about the US current account deficit have been balanced by the fact that US growth prospects continue to be better than those in Europe or Japan, notwithstanding the recent concerns about a slowdown. The fact that US interest rates now clearly exceed those in Europe also seemed to support the US dollar. Speculative positioning suggests that sentiment towards the US dollar has become less negative. The large speculative short positions in the US dollar against other major currencies that were present earlier in the year have been scaled back significantly and, in some cases, speculators are now holding net long positions. ", " The attention of global foreign exchange markets in recent months has not really been focused on exchange rates among the major countries (Table 4). Rather, there has been more interest in the exchange rate arrangements of China, with speculation continuing about when it will free up its exchange rate arrangements. That China will, at some point, break its existing peg of 8.28 to the US dollar is now accepted in markets as being a certainty. The issues that are being debated are when this will happen and what type of arrangement will be put in place once the break is made. ", " Expectations of a change in exchange rate policy in China are expressed by market participants in the non-deliverable forward market, which is not controlled by the authorities. This market is currently pricing in an appreciation of 6 per cent over the coming year (Graph 21). ", " This focus on Chinese exchange arrangements is having a more general impact on exchange rates in the region, with most other regional currencies also facing upward pressure. Partly this is because markets expect that, if China revalues, other Asian countries may also let their currencies appreciate. Market participants are therefore using some of these currencies, which are more freely traded than the Chinese renminbi, as ‘proxy hedges’ for a Chinese revaluation. Against this background, Asian authorities have continued to intervene in foreign exchange markets, though less strenuously than was the case in mid 2004 when upward pressures on regional exchange rates were also very strong. ", " Trading in the Australian dollar over the past three months has continued to be relatively uneventful. The exchange rate has been in a stable range between US75 cents and US80 cents, and 62 and 65 on a <span class=\"no-wrap\">trade-weighted</span> basis, over the past six months (Graph 22, Table 5). In early March, it reached the upper end of this range, much the same level as the peak a year earlier, against a background of, inter alia, strong domestic profit results, speculation of foreign takeovers, and rising commodity prices (especially base metals). The level of A$ Uridashi bond issuance during March was also sizeable, which added to demand for Australian dollars, though some of this was offset by the increased maturities of existing A$ Uridashi bonds (Graph 23). Since March, however, the currency has fallen back to around the middle of its recent trading range as the degree of optimism about commodity prices receded and on the expectation that interest rate differentials relative to the US would narrow. ", " While market sentiment towards the Australian dollar remains positive, there has been a scaling back of speculative long positions in Australian dollar futures, albeit from high levels. However, the Australian dollar remains one of the few currencies in which market participants continue to have long speculative positions relative to the US dollar <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 24)</span>; in the case of the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc, speculative positions against the US dollar are short. ", " With the narrower trading range for the Australian dollar during 2005, exchange rate volatility has fallen below its post-float average. The implied volatility from Australian dollar options shows a similar easing in volatility in recent months. ", " As the Australian dollar appreciated against the US dollar and traded near the top of its recent range, the Bank took the opportunity to add around $1 billion to net reserves over the three months, though mostly in March. Overall, net reserves increased from just under $25 billion at the end of January to around $26 billion at the end of April. Over the same period, holdings of foreign exchange under swaps increased from $21½ billion to around $26 billion as the Bank continued to make use of foreign exchange swaps to help with domestic liquidity management. ", " Domestic final demand grew strongly during 2004, expanding by 1.0 per cent in the December quarter, and by 4.0 per cent over the year. Within the total, strong quarterly growth in business investment and a solid rise in public demand helped to offset a cooling in household consumption growth and a fall in dwelling investment. This rise in demand was largely met by further strong growth of imports and a run-down in inventories, so that net exports and inventory movements each subtracted around ½ percentage point from GDP growth in the December quarter. These developments, accompanied by a weak export performance, led to a marked slowing in output growth. GDP is estimated to have risen by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter, after increasing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.2 per cent</span> in the September quarter, and growth over the year slowed to 1.5 per cent (Table 6). The regional composition of growth has been quite divergent, with the resource-intensive states of Western Australia and Queensland growing much more strongly than the rest of the country (for more detail, see ‘<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B: Divergences in Regional Performance</a>’). ", " Notwithstanding the broad pattern of slowing GDP growth in 2004, business and consumer confidence remained very strong during the year. Business surveys suggest a continuation of relatively good conditions in the early <span class=\"no-wrap\">part of 2005</span>, though not quite as strong as last year. Employment continued to grow strongly in the March quarter. With the latest trade figures showing solid increases in exports in the first two months of this year, and retail sales resuming growth in the March quarter, output growth is likely to have picked up in the early <span class=\"no-wrap\">part of 2005</span> from the weak outcomes recorded in late 2004. ", " Household consumption continues to expand at a fairly solid pace, despite slowing over 2004. In the December quarter, consumption rose by 0.4 per cent, but this followed a 1.2 per cent increase in the September quarter. Over the four quarters to December, consumption increased by a little under 4 per cent, down from a peak growth rate of more than 6 per cent seen earlier that year. Household disposable income grew strongly over 2004, in line with the growth in employment and wages, as well as reflecting the boost from fiscal measures in last year's Budget. With income growth outpacing that in consumption, there was also a small increase in the measured household saving ratio. ", " The modest growth in consumption in the December quarter reflected a ½ per cent fall in expenditure on goods, which was smaller than the decline reported in the retail trade survey. Growth in spending on services, which tends to be less volatile, slowed only marginally in the December quarter. More recently, the volume of retail sales rose by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter, driven by solid growth in January and February, with the value of sales unchanged in March. Motor vehicle sales rose strongly in the March quarter, as buyers took advantage of the price cuts stemming from the tariff reduction in January (Graph 25). Following a sharp fall in March, consumer sentiment, as measured by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index, rose only slightly in April, though it remains a little above long-run average levels. The fall in sentiment and the apparent softness in retail sales in March are likely to reflect several factors including the March interest rate increase, the publication of the weak December quarter national accounts and associated commentary, and the recent steep rise in petrol prices. ", " Total household assets rose by 6 per cent over the year to the December quarter 2004 (Table 7), in line with income but well below the average of previous years. The main reason for the slowdown was subdued growth in dwelling prices, and hence dwelling assets, although strong growth in household financial assets, driven by rising equity prices, offset this to some extent. Broadly steady dwelling prices and a small rise in equity markets over the March quarter are suggestive of a small quarterly increase in household assets. ", " Despite slowing asset growth, households continued to increase their borrowings at a fast pace in the December quarter. Consequently, the household debt-servicing ratio reached 9.4 per cent of disposable income (Graph 26). Ongoing accumulation of household debt and the increase in the cash rate in March mean that the debt-servicing ratio is likely to have increased in the early part of 2005. Indicators of financial stress – such as loan arrears – have risen a little recently, but remain low relative to historical experience. ", " After experiencing a strong upswing in recent years, dwelling investment fell by 3½ per cent in the December quarter, following a 1½ per cent fall in the September quarter, to be nearly 2 per cent lower over the year. New dwelling construction and alterations and additions activity both contracted in the quarter, consistent with the earlier downward trend in leading indicators such as local government building approvals and commencements. House approvals are well below the average levels observed over the past couple of years, and the Housing Industry Association series of new home sales – which are commitments to build – is below levels of a year ago. Similarly, the value of approvals for alterations and additions has also fallen since mid 2004. Given the decline <span class=\"no-wrap\">over 2004</span> in these leading indicators, dwelling investment is likely to fall further over the next few quarters. ", " More recently, however, there was a pick-up in residential building approvals in the March quarter, although this was largely driven by the volatile medium-density sector; house approvals have been broadly unchanged over the past six months (Graph 27). Together with other factors – such as strong underlying demand based on demographic trends, favourable employment conditions, and the large amount of work still in the pipeline – this points to the current downturn in dwelling investment being relatively mild compared with past experience. In line with this, the Master Builders Association construction survey indicates that large backlogs of work to be done can be expected to sustain building activity at high levels over the next six months. ", " Demand for housing finance has increased over recent months. The value of housing loan approvals increased, from an average of around $12½ billion per month over the first three quarters of 2004 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">$14.2 billion</span> in February <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 28)</span>. Owner-occupier loan approvals have been rising consistently for much of the past year and are now above their late 2003 peak. Loan approvals to investors have also risen in recent months, but remain <span class=\"no-wrap\">23 per cent</span> below their peak. Over the six months to March 2005, housing credit grew at an annualised rate of 12.9 per cent, with the owner-occupier and investor components now growing at a broadly similar pace. ", " Nationwide house prices appear to have been fairly stable since early 2004. A variety of data are now available for the March quarter, which point to broadly unchanged median house prices, following a slight rise in the December quarter (Table 8 and Graph 29). This assessment is based on the usual wide range of individual estimates, with some allowance made for the seasonal compositional effects that generally boost measured median prices in the December quarter and weigh on the March quarter reading. Preliminary APM contract-dated data, which are sourced from state land titles offices, show a fall in nationwide house prices in the March quarter. These early estimates, however, tend to be progressively revised up as more transactions are settled and processed, and the extent of these revisions in the past suggests a relatively flat final result. Similarly, preliminary data from Residex, which are also sourced from land titles offices but based on repeat sales of individual properties, show that house prices were relatively flat in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in the March quarter. Data from the CBA, which are based on its lending to owner-occupiers, also show broadly unchanged nationwide house prices in the March quarter, after a rise in the December quarter. House prices in Sydney remain lower than they were a year ago, while results are somewhat mixed for Melbourne and Canberra. In contrast, prices rose over the year to the March quarter in Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and Hobart, albeit at a slower rate than in the previous few years. ", " Conditions in the business sector generally remain favourable, although business surveys report some easing in conditions since around the start of the year (Graph 30). The March quarter NAB survey and the ACCI Survey of Investor Confidence, covering the non-farm sector, and the Sensis Business Index survey of small and medium businesses, all reported a moderation in conditions and expectations, but the survey responses generally remain at or above their long-run averages. NAB survey respondents also reported that capacity utilisation reached record levels, most notably in construction and in mining where conditions are particularly strong (Graph 31). Capacity constraints on production growth continue to be reported, with firms highlighting shortages of materials, equipment and transport and distribution services. While such reports are widespread, they are most prevalent in the non-residential construction and resource sectors, where they are reportedly resulting in the deferral of some projects. ", " Conditions are not as strong in the manufacturing sector as in the economy overall. The ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers reported some softening in business conditions in the March quarter, with the composite index of activity and the measure of capacity utilisation both falling from very high levels, to be closer to their long-run averages. Business confidence declined to below-average levels. Indicators of activity from the AIG's Performance of Manufacturing Index and quarterly survey suggest conditions in manufacturing in the March quarter were at or below their longer-run averages. ", " Corporate profitability remains strong, although the growth in profits, as measured by private non-financial <span class=\"no-wrap\">gross operating surplus (GOS)</span>, has eased recently after a period of strong growth (Graph 32). In the December quarter, GOS increased by 0.8 per cent and was broadly flat over the second half of 2004. This moderation in profits growth is somewhat at odds with the more buoyant picture suggested by reported earnings for listed companies, though this may partly reflect differences in definitions and coverage (see the Box ‘<a href=\"#box-d\">December Half 2004 Profit Results</a>’ following the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-financial-markets\">Domestic Financial Markets</a>’). But on any measure, profitability remains high and is likely to have contributed to the continued expansion of business investment. Businesses have also had ample access to external funds. Over the year to March 2005, business credit grew by around 11½ per cent and outstanding non-intermediated debt increased by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 per cent</span>. Similarly, net equity raisings have strengthened over the past few months and in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">March quarter 2005</span> were above their average of the past five years. ", " Consistent with the high levels of capacity utilisation and profitability reported by firms, the upswing in business investment seen in recent years continued through 2004, with growth of almost 10 per cent over the year. Capital spending grew rapidly in the December quarter with strong growth recorded across all components. Machinery &amp; equipment investment continued to expand rapidly in the quarter; spending in this area has now increased by around 5 per cent in each of the past three quarters, in line with sustained growth in capital imports. Non-residential construction also recorded a large rise, driven by a sharp rebound in building activity together with strong growth in the engineering component. ", " The outlook for business investment remains positive, with high capacity utilisation rates and a generally favourable outlook for the domestic economy providing considerable incentive to invest. Still-strong profitability and a favourable financing climate also ensure that firms have ample access to funds for expanding capacity. The latest capital expenditure (Capex) survey points to continued growth in business investment in real terms, though at a more moderate pace than that seen during 2004. For machinery &amp; equipment, the surveyed investment intentions imply reasonably solid growth in 2005/06, largely reflecting a pick-up in spending in the transport &amp; storage sector. The Rabobank survey, conducted in the March quarter, suggests that investment intentions for farm equipment (which are not covered in the Capex survey) remain close to pre-drought levels. ", " Forward-looking indicators of non-residential construction suggest a continuation of the upswing in activity experienced over the past three years, albeit at a more moderate pace. Growth is expected to be supported by the large amount of engineering work due to get underway in 2004/05, including some large resource-related projects (Graph 33). However, the building activity component is facing a softer outlook as the amount of building work approved recently has fallen well short of the current level of construction. ", " After firming considerably over the December quarter of 2004, labour market conditions have remained buoyant in the new year. Three strong monthly increases in the March quarter brought year-ended employment growth to 3.4 per cent in March, up from 2.7 per cent in December (Graph 34). Employment growth continues to be concentrated in the full-time component, although in the last six months the contribution from part-time jobs has increased. The surprising combination of strength in employment growth and weakness in output growth in the second half of 2004 implies that labour productivity, as measured by output per hour worked, fell by 0.4 per cent over 2004. While some slowing in labour productivity growth might be expected as firms find it more difficult to find suitable labour, the recorded slowing seems unusually pronounced. The acceleration in employment has been matched by an increase in the participation rate to 64½ per cent in March, after a period where it had been fairly constant at around 63½ per cent. The unemployment rate remained stable at 5.1 per cent between <span class=\"no-wrap\">December 2004</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">March 2005</span>, the lowest rate seen since late 1976. While all states recorded falling unemployment rates over the year and an increase in the pace of year-ended employment growth in the March quarter, labour market performance continues to diverge. Growth in employment has been especially strong in the resource-intensive states of Queensland and Western Australia, and well below the current national average pace in New South Wales (for more detail, see ‘<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B: Divergences in Regional Performance</a>’). ", " Employment gains were seen in most industries over the year to the March quarter. The mining, retail, and construction industries all experienced growth in employment of more than 5 per cent. Employment in <span class=\"no-wrap\">property &amp; business</span> services increased again in the March quarter and returned to positive growth over the year. In contrast, employment growth was below average for manufacturing and slowed in industries, such as education, that supply household services. ", " Although it would not be surprising to see some weakness in measured employment in coming months, given the extraordinary strength seen recently, forward-looking indicators of labour demand suggest continued underlying momentum in employment in the near term (Graph 35). The ACCI-Westpac and NAB survey measures of hiring intentions eased in the March quarter from recent peaks, but their levels are still well above long-run averages. Similarly, print- and internet-based measures of vacancies indicate a high level of demand, although the interpretation of quarterly movements has been affected by unusual holiday-related seasonality. The ABS measure of job vacancies increased strongly in the March quarter, to be more than 40 per cent higher than a year earlier. Liaison indicates that labour shortages are most pronounced among skilled workers in the non-residential construction and resources sectors, and in parts of the business services sector. However, labour shortages are becoming increasingly broad-based across industries and skill levels. Consistent with this, business surveys indicate that difficulty finding suitable labour has become a key factor constraining output. ", " In recent years Australia's balance of payments has been characterised by a lacklustre expansion in export volumes, rapid growth in import volumes, and a sharp increase in the terms of trade. The latter stages of 2004 generally saw a continuation of these trends. Encouragingly, though, there are early signs of a firmer recovery in exports. Strong growth in the resources area underpinned a modest lift in overall export volumes in the December quarter 2004, and more recent monthly data point to further growth in the new year. On the import side, continued strength in domestic demand, the high exchange rate and, more recently, tariff reductions on some goods have resulted in renewed strength in import volumes. While growth in import volumes continued to outpace that of exports in the December quarter, the effect on the trade balance was again cushioned by a rise in the terms of trade, leaving the trade deficit broadly unchanged at 3.2 per cent of GDP (Graph 36). Given the large increases in contract prices for iron ore and coal that have recently been negotiated, a further significant rise in the terms of trade is expected around mid year, along with some narrowing in the trade deficit. ", " Somewhat unusually, movements in the current account deficit (CAD) have recently been dominated by developments in the net income deficit (NID), with its sharp increase in the second half of 2004 pushing the CAD to 7.1 per cent of GDP in the December quarter, the largest since quarterly ABS data began in 1959. In the year to the December quarter 2004, the net income deficit increased by about one-third, to $8.2 billion or <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.8 per cent</span> of GDP. Interest payments to foreign holders of Australian debt rose broadly in line with growth in the stock of debt, while payments on foreign holdings of Australian equity rose sharply (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a> for a more detailed discussion of Australia's net income deficit). ", " Export earnings increased by almost 12 per cent over 2004, mainly the result of sharp increases in resource export prices. Growth in export volumes over the year was subdued, with a recovery in rural exports and an increase in manufactured exports largely offset by weakness in other categories. Export volumes posted a modest rise in the December quarter 2004, driven by a nascent recovery in resource exports and solid growth in manufactured exports (Graph 37). More recently, monthly trade data for January and February indicate that both the value and volume of exports are likely to have risen further in the March quarter. ", " Rural export earnings increased strongly in late 2003 and early 2004 from the low levels associated with the drought. In addition, bans on meat imports from the US and Canada have led to strong international demand for Australian beef. Since mid 2004, however, rural export earnings have fallen, mostly due to a decline in cereals exports, following the smaller winter crop in 2004/05, and weaker exports of wool. Looking forward, meat exports are expected to remain at a high level in the near term, though they are likely to ease subsequently as the US re-enters the Japanese beef market, following the conditional lifting of a BSE-related ban. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) expects summer crop production to grow by 13 per cent in 2004/05, which should support cereals exports in coming quarters. Further ahead, and assuming average seasonal conditions, ABARE is forecasting the winter crop to increase by 12 per cent in 2005/06. However, there may be some downside risk to this outlook, as the Bureau of Meteorology has indicated an above-average probability of <span lang=\"es\">El Niño</span> conditions emerging later this year. ", " The value of resource exports rose by 25 per cent over 2004, propelled by sharply higher commodity prices. In the December quarter, the volume of resource exports rose by 6½ per cent, after having declined over the earlier part of the year. The increase in the quarter was broadly based across components, with particularly large rises recorded in exports of ‘other mineral fuels’ and non-monetary gold, as production commenced from the 4th LNG train at the North-West Shelf and at a range of new gold mines, including the Telfer redevelopment. As outlined in the previous <em>Statement</em>, the outlook for the resources sector is quite favourable: external demand remains buoyant, a large number of new projects are due to commence production, and there is likely to be some easing of transport infrastructure constraints. ", " The value of manufactured exports increased solidly over 2004, owing to growth in both volumes and prices. In the December quarter, the volume of manufactured exports rose by 3½ per cent. Over the past few years, manufactured export volumes have performed more strongly than other categories, though growth has been well short of the rapid pace seen in the 1990s. Liaison reports suggest that the high level of the exchange rate and the flow of low-cost goods from developing countries onto the world market are hampering the competitiveness of Australian producers. Most other industrial countries have also experienced only modest growth in manufactured exports so far this decade, all of which may suggest that a return to the rapid growth rates seen during the 1990s is unlikely. ", " The volume of services exports fell steadily over the course of 2004, and drove a decline in services export earnings. The weakness in volumes was fairly broad-based, with contractions evident in exports of travel and freight services, while exports of other transportation services (including air travel) were broadly flat. More recently, monthly trade data for January and February suggest that services export volumes are likely to have risen in the March quarter. The outlook for tourism-related services appears positive, with short-term visitor arrivals showing a firm upward trend and industry contacts reporting solid international demand. ", " Import volumes appear to have considerable momentum, growing by 3¼ per cent in the December quarter and by more than 13 per cent over 2004. Underpinning this expansion was continued solid growth in domestic demand, coupled with the appreciation of the Australian dollar over the past several years. All major import categories rose solidly in the December quarter and over the year, with particularly strong growth in the goods categories over the past year (Graph 38). ", " More recent data suggest that growth in import volumes remained firm in the early stages of 2005. In the March quarter, the value of imports appears likely to have risen by around 2½ per cent, with strong growth in import volumes and lower prices owing to a further appreciation of the Australian dollar. Imports of consumption goods in the quarter received a boost from the reduction in some tariffs on 1 January; tariffs on imports of passenger motor vehicles and parts fell from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, while the average tariff on textiles, clothing &amp; footwear fell from 21 percent to 14½ per cent. ", " Preliminary estimates indicate that the RBA Index of Commodity Prices (ICP) rose by 8.7 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to April, to be 12.5 per cent higher over the year (Table 9). Much of the recent strength has come from a steep rise estimated for ‘other resource’ prices, as sharply higher contract prices for iron ore and coal began to take effect from 1 April, and to a lesser extent, from rising base metals prices. In Australian dollar terms, commodity prices rose by 6.6 per cent over the three months to April, and they were up by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">12 per cent</span> over the year. ", " Base metals prices increased by around 7 per cent over the three months to April, although there was some retracement during April. All metals prices have posted significant overall gains, supported by strong speculative and physical demand and associated stock drawdowns. The rise in nickel prices and fall in stocks have been especially sharp, owing to resurgent demand from China. ", " Rural prices declined overall as falls in the prices of wheat and beef &amp; veal offset a pick-up in cotton prices. The most recent fall in wheat prices was driven by the favourable outlook for the US crop. Cotton prices have strengthened over recent months amid expectations of lower global plantings and higher Chinese import demand. ", " Sharply higher contract prices for coal and iron ore in 2005/06 took effect from the beginning of April and are expected to boost the Bank's Index of Commodity Prices by around 25 per cent, once they are fully included in published transaction prices. Based on past experience, the effects should largely flow through over the next few months. As a result of the strong global demand for steel, coking coal producers negotiated an increase of around 120 per cent in contract prices, with iron ore contract prices generally rising by more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">70 per cent</span> <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 39)</span>. Steaming coal producers appear to have achieved more modest price increases of close to 20 per cent, though this follows rises of 68 per cent negotiated in 2004/05. ", " The terms of trade rose by 1.6 per cent in the December quarter, to be 10 per cent higher over the year, and at the highest level seen in more than 30 years (Graph 40). The increase in the quarter reflected a further small rise in world commodity prices and other goods export prices, coupled with gains in the services terms of trade. Trade prices data suggest an increase of more than 2 per cent in the March quarter, and further significant rises in the terms of trade are expected around mid 2005 as the new contract prices for coal and iron ore take effect. ", " Despite an increase of ½ million barrels per day in OPEC's production ceiling in March, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price has increased over the past three months. Forecasts for global demand in 2005 have generally been revised up over the past few months, although a more recent International Energy Agency (IEA) report showed a slight downward revision. This comes at a time when supply is constrained by limited spare capacity, and speculative demand has been boosted by research reports suggesting that the price of oil could move significantly higher. ", " The increase in the cash rate target from 5¼ to 5½ per cent announced in early March came as no surprise to financial markets. At the time of the increase, the market was also factoring in a further tightening in monetary policy over the next six months. Market expectations of a tightening had been building since the previous <em>Statement</em> and were reflected in short-term market yields, which rose by around 30 basis points between early February and early March (Graph 41). ", " These yields rose further in the weeks immediately following the rise in the cash rate target as markets continued to revise upward their expectations for a further tightening. Market behaviour at that time seemed based on the assumption that the pattern of successive monthly interest rate increases in 2002 and 2003 could be repeated. The rise in yields began to unwind in late March, however, in response to the fall in global equity prices and growing concern about the impact of higher oil prices on global economic activity. By April, the chance of a monetary tightening was seen as being only about 50:50 and by May the market had come to the view that there was little chance of a further rate rise. ", " Long-term yields have mirrored the pattern in short-term yields since the last <em>Statement</em>, rising in February and March then falling in April, largely in response to developments in overseas markets (Graph 42). In net terms, though, long-term rates are little changed over this period. Yields on 10-year government bonds, at 5.3 per cent, are now around the same as at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> despite having been as high as 5.8 per cent in late March. Yields on inflation-linked bonds, at 2.7 per cent, are also largely unchanged in net terms since early February. In contrast to yields on nominal bonds, yields on inflation-linked bonds have for the past six months remained close to their lowest recorded levels. ", " The small net change in local bond yields since February is consistent with developments in the US over the same period. As a result, the current spread between Australian and US 10-year bond yields, of around 115 basis points, is much the same as at the time of the last <em>Statement</em>. ", " The shape of the yield curve has changed markedly since early February, with the curve now inverted. Since early April, the yield on 10-year bonds has moved from being around 15 basis points above the cash rate to being around 20 basis points below. This is discussed further in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#financial-conditions\">Financial Conditions</a>’. ", " Spreads between corporate bond yields and swap rates, which are a measure of the market's credit risk perceptions, have fallen slightly since the previous <em>Statement</em> (Graph 43). This is in contrast to US and European markets, where corporate bond spreads to swaps have risen over the period. The premia on credit default swaps, an alternative measure of credit risk perceptions, have risen. Both measures, however, remain low by historical standards, suggesting that markets continue to see the outlook for the domestic corporate sector as fairly favourable. ", " Following the 25 basis point increase in the cash rate in early March, most lenders have increased the indicator rates on their variable-rate housing and personal loans by a similar amount (Graph 44, Table 10). However, the average increase in mortgage managers' basic housing rate has been less, at 20 basis points. All of the major banks have increased their standard credit card interest rates by at least 25 basis points, with a couple announcing slightly higher increases. ", " While lenders have increased their housing indicator rates, the trend of the past couple of years has been partly to offset rises in indicator rates by offering bigger discounts or discounted loans to a wider range of borrowers. A measure of this discounting is only available with a significant lag, but the latest figures suggest that around <span class=\"no-wrap\">80 per cent</span> of borrowers taking out variable-rate housing loans pay less than the indicator rate for these loans. The weighted-average rate paid by new borrowers was almost 50 basis points below the standard variable indicator rate in mid 2004, with this average discount having doubled over the previous two years. ", " Interest rates on fixed-rate housing loans have increased by around 30 basis points since the previous <em>Statement</em>. This largely reflects the earlier rise in the cost of funding fixed-rate loans, evident in higher swap rates. The major banks' average 3-year fixed housing rate is currently 6.90 per cent, 40 basis points below their standard variable indicator rate, but closer to the variable rate actually charged to new borrowers given the prevalence of discounting. Demand for fixed-rate housing loans was fairly strong in late 2004 and early 2005, ahead of the monetary policy tightening announced in early March. In February, the latest month for which data are available, around 11 per cent of new owner-occupier loans were taken out at fixed rates, broadly in line with the average share over the preceding four months, but above the 7 per cent share that existed in the middle of 2004. ", " Interest rates on variable-rate business loans have risen by 25 basis points following the monetary policy <span class=\"no-wrap\">tightening (Table 10)</span>. Rates on fixed-rate loans for small businesses have moved up a little since the previous <em>Statement</em>, rising by around 5 basis points in net terms. ", " The Australian share market continued to rise rapidly in the early part of 2005. By 21 March, its recent peak, the market was up 25 per cent from a year earlier and almost 60 per cent from its low point in early 2003. More recently, however, the market has fallen by around 7 per cent, broadly in line with international equity markets, which in turn have been particularly sensitive to economic news from the US. The net effect of recent developments is that Australian share prices have fallen by 3 per cent since the previous <em>Statement</em>, similar to the net falls in the S&amp;P 500 and MSCI World indices over the same period (Graph 45). Mining and energy companies accounted for a large part of the advance in the ASX 200 in the early part of the year and for much of its subsequent decline (Graph 46). ", " A strong rise in company earnings in the December half year (see <a href=\"#box-d\">Box D</a>), together with the recent fall in share prices, has seen the price-earnings ratio (P/E) fall from 21 to 15, which is around its long-run average (Graph 47). So far, only a portion of this rise in company profits has been passed on to shareholders in the form of higher dividends; in April, the dividend yield was 3.7 per cent compared with 3.3 per cent in January. In recent weeks, a number of companies have issued profit warnings for 2004/05 as a whole. While these warnings have attracted considerable attention, the companies concerned account for around 2 per cent of total market capitalisation. ", " Australian non-government entities issued $40 billion of bonds in the March quarter (Table 11 and Graph 48). This was broadly in line with average quarterly issuance in 2004, but below the very strong issuance seen in the first quarter of last year. ", " Asset-backed vehicles issued $16 billion of bonds in the quarter, with this amount fairly evenly split between onshore and offshore markets. The value of issuance by asset-backed vehicles was 25 per cent below the value seen in the corresponding period of 2004 but investor demand for mortgage-backed securities remains strong, as evidenced by the fact that primary spreads remain close to their historical lows. Bonds issued by financial institutions totalled $21 billion in the March quarter, much the same as in the corresponding period of 2004. Issuance by non-financial corporates either onshore or offshore totalled a little over $3 billion, following a record $10 billion of issuance in the December quarter of last year. ", " Over the March quarter, the value of non-government bonds outstanding in Australia increased by $16 billion to $193 billion (Graph 49). This increase was fairly evenly split between asset-backed, non-resident and financial institutions' bonds. The outstanding amount of Commonwealth Government bonds increased slightly to $54 billion, while the state governments' bond outstandings rose more strongly, to $62 billion. The rise in state government bonds partly reflects a switch from offshore issuance and some refinancing of debt that is due to mature shortly. ", " Australian entities' issuance of hybrid securities has remained robust in 2005 to date, with almost $3 billion issued since the previous <em>Statement</em>. Financial institutions accounted for more than half of issuance, with 55 per cent of total hybrid issuance by Australian entities going into offshore markets. The adoption of International Accounting Standards in Australia has continued to guide the types of hybrid securities being issued. Perpetual step-up preference shares (which are classified as equity for tax and accounting purposes) have accounted for the majority of issuance by both financial and non-financial institutions since the previous <em>Statement</em>. ", " Net equity raisings totalled $6.4 billion in the March quarter, about 40 per cent higher than the quarterly average since the beginning of 2000 (Graph 50). There were 32 initial public offerings (IPOs) raising a total of $1.1 billion during the quarter, although almost half of the total related to one large investment company. Non-IPO raisings were stronger, at $5.7 billion, with many of the larger raisings being undertaken by property and infrastructure funds for the acquisition of interests in new properties. Non-IPO raisings have been the major means by which equity has been raised in recent years. Non-IPO raisings mainly comprise: placements, in which shares are offered without a prospectus to a limited number of large investors; rights issues, where shares are offered to all shareholders in a fixed ratio to their existing holdings; dividend reinvestment plans, where shareholders' dividends are reinvested in additional shares rather than paid as cash; and employee share plans, including the exercising of executive options (Graph 51). ", " Financial conditions are unlikely to be constraining economic activity, despite the increase in the cash rate following the March Board meeting. The nominal and real cash rates are now both close to their average levels of the past decade. Most lenders passed on the March increase in the nominal cash rate in full to housing and business lending rates (Graph 52). Nevertheless, banks' standard variable home loan interest rates remain slightly below their average of the past decade, reflecting some compression in margins during this period. In addition, as more borrowers turn to non-bank lenders or take advantage of products with discounted rates, the gap between indicator rates and effective housing interest rates has widened (Graph 53). For businesses, indicator interest rates have returned to near their historical average, but there is evidence that actual interest rates paid have fallen relative to indicator rates. This implies that the cost of intermediated funds to businesses remains low by historical standards. ", " Bond yields are currently slightly below the cash rate, and this inversion of the yield curve would normally indicate that the current policy setting was viewed by the market as being relatively tight. However, bond yields have been mostly driven by US developments, where bond yields appear unusually low against a background of strong growth, rising inflation and increasing short-term interest rates. Chairman Greenspan has recently described the low levels of bond yields in the US as a ‘conundrum’. ", " The current level of interest rates does not appear to be constraining demand for credit. While total credit growth moderated during 2004, it has now stabilised at around 12–13 per cent (Graph 54). This is still higher than the average pace over the past decade, which itself was a period of rapid growth in credit in comparison with nominal GDP. ", " Household credit expanded at an annual rate of around 13½ per cent over the six months to March, which is close to the rate recorded in the previous six-month period, but well down from the peak rates seen in 2003. This slowing and subsequent stabilisation was driven by the housing credit component, which expanded at an annual rate of around 13 per cent over the six months to March (Table 12). In contrast, personal credit growth has been stronger, driven by a pick-up in fixed-term lending. ", " Business credit growth has also been strong. The year-ended rate has risen to 11½ per cent, its highest rate in seven years. The level of monthly business loan approvals remains high, despite having fallen from its peak in September 2004, which points to solid ongoing business credit growth. When the recent strength in capital market raisings is also considered, it is evident that businesses continue to have access to ample external finance. ", " The Australian dollar has appreciated modestly over the past few months; in real trade-weighted terms, in early May it was at a level similar to its most recent quarterly peak early in 2004, around 13 per cent above its post-float average. At this level the exchange rate may be constraining activity for some exporting and import-competing firms, particularly in manufacturing and services. On the other hand, for resource producers, production will be highly profitable at current exchange rates, given developments in resource prices. Relative to the terms of trade, the real exchange rate does not appear to be unusually high. As the Bank has noted elsewhere, the rise in the terms of trade is likely to be quite expansionary for the economy over the coming year or more. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter to be 2.4 per cent higher over the year (Table 13, Graph 55). The most significant contributions to the quarterly increase were made by seasonal price increases for education and pharmaceuticals, and ongoing strength in house purchase costs. Offsetting these rises was a fall in petrol prices resulting from a temporary easing in world crude oil prices, and a fall in motor vehicle prices related to tariff cuts in January 2005. The Bank's assessment is that the underlying rate of inflation over the year to the March quarter is close to the headline CPI rate. This assessment is based on a range of underlying measures, including statistical measures that draw on the distribution of year-ended price changes. ", " The gap between inflation of tradable and non-tradable items persists, though it narrowed further in the quarter. Tradables prices increased by 0.6 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Abstracting from food and petrol prices, tradables prices were only slightly lower than a year ago, confirming that the dampening effect of the large exchange rate appreciation in 2002 and 2003 has now largely passed (Graph 56). Non-tradables price inflation has been significantly stronger than tradables inflation for some time, and picked up slightly to 3.7 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Non-tradables price inflation continues to be affected by strength in house purchase costs, which increased by 5½ per cent over the year; this increase is the result of rising costs of skilled labour and materials. ", " Producer price data suggest that upstream inflationary pressures eased in the March quarter; this followed three quarters of strong growth in a broad range of output prices. The recent easing in producer price inflation was evident at all stages of production, and for both imported and domestic items (Table 14). The fall in crude oil prices in the March quarter played an important role in this outcome. ", " The mild appreciation in the exchange rate over the March quarter also contributed to falls in import prices at all stages of production. However, as with the tradables component of the CPI, the year-ended change in prices of imported items provides further evidence that the downward price pressure from the sharp appreciation of 2002 and 2003 has continued to wane (Graph 57). Aside from exchange rate and oil-related price falls, the most significant price declines for imported items were for industrial and electronic <span class=\"no-wrap\">machinery &amp; equipment</span> and motor vehicles &amp; parts. Partly offsetting these effects, higher world prices were apparent for a range of raw materials, including plastics and iron &amp; steel manufactures. ", " Abstracting from oil-related price falls, domestic prices at the final stage of production increased by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter, underpinned by ongoing strength in building construction prices. Construction prices increased by 1.8 per cent in the March quarter and by 7.6 per cent over the year, with prices for non-residential construction running ahead of those for house building. Price pressures in the construction industry were stronger, amid reports of increasing labour and material input costs, in particular for steel and cement. Domestic prices at earlier stages of production, excluding oil-related price falls, increased modestly in the quarter. ", " Most indicators of aggregate wage growth remained firm in the December quarter, though there are few signs that the strong wage pressures evident in some sectors are becoming generalised. The Wage Price Index (WPI) grew by 1.0 per cent in the December quarter, a slightly larger increase than had been seen in recent quarters, with the index 3.6 per cent higher over the year (Graph 58). The average annualised wage increase (AAWI) in federal enterprise bargaining agreements registered in the December quarter remained in line with that seen over the past year at 4.0 per cent. The AAWI in all current federal agreements was also little changed in the quarter at 4.0 per cent. Other official labour cost data based on wage-bill measures, such as average weekly ordinary time earnings and average earnings from the national accounts, paint a similar picture, identifying firm wage outcomes but giving little indication of an acceleration of aggregate wages growth. Furthermore, the NAB quarterly business survey reported that year-ended growth in labour costs was essentially unchanged in March, and is expected to remain roughly constant in the June quarter. ", " While aggregate wage growth remains contained, official wage statistics and liaison have pointed to greater wage pressures in industries facing strong demand, such as construction and mining (Graph 59). Wage growth in the construction sector, as measured by the WPI, picked up to 5.5 per cent over the year to December. Official wage data also show ongoing strength in public-sector wage growth and a significant rise in wage growth in education: the WPI measure of public-sector wage growth increased by 4.2 per cent over the year to December, almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">1 percentage point</span> higher than the equivalent private-sector wage series. In addition, liaison suggests that there is wage pressure in some occupations in the business services sector, particularly accountancy, although it is not possible to distinguish these groups in the official wage statistics. Wage rises for other occupations (such as childcare and healthcare) have also been achieved recently by employees seeking to maintain wage relativities with other groups. ", " Business surveys and liaison continue to indicate generalised difficulties in finding suitable labour (Graph 60). Consistent with these labour shortages, firms are reportedly increasing the frequency of their salary reviews and more actively using non-wage remuneration, such as bonus payments and more generous leave provisions, to attract and retain employees. Firms are also encountering rapid growth in subcontractor rates and training costs. Consequently, there may be greater labour cost pressures than are evident in narrower official wage measures which do not capture these forms of payment. Unit labour costs, which measure total (wage and non-wage) labour costs per unit of output, grew by 3.4 per cent over the year to December, above the average of the past five years. This mostly reflects an apparent slowing in productivity growth, as output growth has eased but employment growth has remained strong. It remains to be seen if the consequent rise in unit labour costs is a precursor to greater inflationary pressures or if it will be absorbed into profit margins. ", " Business surveys provide mixed signals about near-term inflationary pressures. The ACCI-Westpac survey reported falls in the net balances of firms increasing selling prices in the March quarter and expecting to raise prices in coming months. According to the NAB survey, product price inflation fell in the March quarter and is expected to be broadly steady in the June quarter. However, the survey reported that retail price inflation is expected to increase in the June quarter, having been steady in the March quarter. ", " Other indicators suggest that inflation is expected to rise modestly over the next two years. The Bank's survey of market economists, conducted following the release of the March quarter CPI, showed that the median forecast for CPI inflation for the year to June 2005 was 2.7 per cent; this was higher than expected at the time of the previous survey owing to recent developments in oil prices. A similar rate of inflation is now expected over the year to June 2006. Union officials expect CPI inflation to be 2.6 per over the year to June before drifting up to 2.8 per cent by mid 2006 (Table 15). ", " Financial market participants' medium-term inflation expectations, calculated as the difference between nominal and indexed bond yields, have changed little since the last <em>Statement</em>, to be around 2.7 per cent. The median inflation expectation of consumers, as reported in the Melbourne Institute survey, was 4.6 per cent in April, up sharply from the previous month, but around its level of the past five years. ", " CPI inflation was 2.4 per cent over the year to the March quarter, with this rate also a good gauge of the Bank's assessment of underlying inflationary pressure. The inflation outcome for the March quarter suggests that the economy has passed the low point for underlying inflation in the current cycle. This has come about because domestic inflationary pressures have remained firm, while the disinflationary effects of the large exchange rate appreciation in 2002 and 2003 have continued to wane. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to rise modestly to a little over 2½ per cent during the course of 2005, and to 3 per cent by the end of 2006. This profile is broadly in line with that presented in the February <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, though recent movements in world oil prices are likely to introduce a divergence between headline and underlying measures of inflation in the short term. In particular, following a quarter when falling petrol prices reduced inflation, the higher level of petrol prices in the first month of the June quarter suggests that a substantial contribution to the CPI is possible, which could take CPI inflation close to 3 per cent in the year to the June quarter. ", " While the central forecast for underlying inflation remains similar to that provided in February, the risks around this outlook now appear more evenly balanced, rather than on the upside as indicated in previous <em>Statements</em>. On the one hand, the ongoing evidence of tightness in the labour market suggests that growth in labour costs may pick up faster than is assumed in the current forecast. In addition, capacity constraints in some parts of the economy and strong global commodity prices could add to upstream price pressures, particularly if sustained strength in energy prices raises inflation expectations. However, given the possibility of some slowing in domestic demand, the risks from upstream costs appear to have moderated, with greater likelihood that any additional pressures might be absorbed into profit margins rather than passed through into consumer prices. ", " After only modest growth initially following the 2001 global recession, international trade in goods and services has rebounded strongly of late, increasing by about 10 per cent in 2004, or approximately double the rate of growth in world GDP (Graph A1). In large part, this reflects the tendency for trade to fluctuate by more than output. However, it also reflects the consequences of ongoing trade liberalisation, and changing demand for final goods and factor inputs as economies develop. The recovery in world trade has been propelled mainly by China and other east Asian economies, which are becoming increasingly engaged in international commerce (Table A1), and to a lesser extent other emerging economies. While accounting for only 5 per cent of world trade, China contributed approximately 15 per cent of the increase in trade in 2004 and became the world's third-largest merchandise exporter. In contrast, the G7 industrialised countries, despite accounting for nearly half of world trade, contributed only around a third of the increase in 2004. ", " The uneven contributions to growth in world trade in part reflect divergences in economic growth across regions. Hesitant demand growth in the euro area explains the modest growth of export and import volumes in the region, since intra-regional trade accounts for around two-thirds of the area's total trade.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> In the United States, trade has been expanding somewhat faster, as strong domestic demand has induced ongoing growth in imports; exports have also staged a recovery, though not one that has been sufficient to arrest further widening of the trade deficit. Japan has seen yet stronger trade growth, with its trade surplus continuing to swell, underpinned by strong demand for its exports from the rest of Asia; most notably, its exports of intermediate and capital goods to China have been growing rapidly. ", " The east Asian region (excluding Japan) has undoubtedly recorded the most impressive trade performance. The surge in demand for ITC goods in 2003–2004 boosted the region's exports of manufactures, while the region's imports have accelerated as China increasingly calls on the rest of the world for raw materials to satisfy its ongoing process of industrialisation. There has also been a substantial change in the pattern of east Asian trade, with intra-regional trade growing in importance. In 2004, 37 per cent of east Asian merchandise exports went to economies elsewhere in the region, up from around 33 per cent five years earlier. This shift has been fuelled not only by increased final demand within the region, particularly from China, but also by a reorganisation of production processes into regional networks. Goods are increasingly being assembled in China from parts sourced elsewhere in the region, and then exported to developed countries. This largely explains why China has recorded growing trade surpluses with the US and Europe, but trade deficits with the rest of Asia. ", " The pattern of global trade has had major implications for the prices of traded goods and services. The emergence of China as a major producer has put downward pressure on the world price of manufactures. On the other hand, China's seemingly insatiable appetite as an importer of raw materials has contributed to the surge in world commodity prices, including oil. Consequently, commodity importers, such as east Asia, Japan and the United States, have experienced a deterioration in their terms of trade. In contrast, the rise in world commodity prices has been beneficial for commodity exporters, such as Australia and Canada, and a number of countries in Latin America and the Middle East.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> ", " The strength of world trade and the shift in trade patterns can also be seen in global shipping freight rates, as shipping still accounts for around two-thirds of the value of all international goods transportation. In line with the pick-up in commodity demand, the Baltic Dry Index, which tracks freight prices for dry bulk goods, has soared to unprecedented levels over the past two years (Graph A2). Unsurprisingly, the pick-up in freight rates has been especially concentrated on trade routes to Asia, and the ports along these routes have become increasingly congested. Conditions are generally expected to remain tight, in part due to short-run inelasticity in the supply of ships and continued strong world activity. ", " As with GDP growth, world trade activity is expected to ease, but remain healthy. The IMF projects world trade to grow by 7.4 per cent in 2005. However, the recent trend of greater involvement by emerging economies in international commerce is set to continue, with China and other east Asian economies likely to account for a growing share of world trade. This can be expected to have a positive influence on the Australian economy in coming years, given Australia's proximity to the east Asian region and the strong trade links that have been cultivated with it over the past decade or so. ", " National economic outcomes typically mask some regional variation, but there appears to be a greater than usual divergence in regional performance at present. This disparity is most evident in the labour market. Employment has expanded rapidly over the past year in most states, especially Queensland and Western Australia, which both recorded growth rates above 5 per cent. In contrast, employment in NSW has been increasing more slowly than elsewhere since early 2003 and is presently growing at around trend rates. This is reasonably healthy by historical standards, but is less than half the pace currently seen in the rest of the country (Graph B1). While unemployment rates have fallen in all states over the year, the extent of the falls has also varied widely (Table B1). The unemployment rate has fallen less in NSW than in the smaller states, and it is now above the national average for the first time since the early 1990s, whereas Queensland's unemployment rate has fallen almost 2 percentage points to be the lowest across all states. ", " The slower employment growth in NSW than elsewhere has been associated with a marked easing in the state's population growth. Population growth in NSW decelerated sharply in 2001 and 2002, and has since lagged significantly behind that in the rest of Australia (Graph B2). While net overseas migration to NSW has fallen over this period, increased outflows of residents to other states have accounted for around two-thirds of the decline in population growth. Changes in the flows of interstate migration are generally associated with relative employment opportunities and housing affordability; consistent with this, the sharpest fall in population growth in NSW coincided with a pronounced decline in the state's relative housing affordability and employment growth. ", " The divergence in employment outcomes between the states accords with differences in indicators of economic growth. Final demand – the most comprehensive measure of state activity available on a quarterly basis – has been growing rapidly in Queensland and Western Australia, supported by exceptional strength in dwelling investment and consumption spending. In contrast, final demand in NSW has been running at rates well below the national average for several years (Graph B3), largely reflecting slower growth in consumption. More recently, this has been exacerbated by a downturn in housing construction, since the housing cycle in NSW is somewhat ahead of that in other states. Using a broader measure of output that includes international trade in goods,<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> it appears that net trade is also weighing more heavily on growth in NSW than in other states, particularly those most exposed to the current resources boom. This is highlighted by recent trends in the value of state exports, which show a solid expansion in Western Australia and more recently in Queensland, buoyed by strong demand for resources and high commodity prices. In contrast, exports in NSW and other states remain below the levels seen in 2001, with NSW particularly affected by the severity and persistence of drought. ", " During the second half of 2004, Australia's current account deficit widened by almost 1½ per cent of GDP to over 7 per cent of GDP, the highest level since the early 1950s. In contrast to other movements in the current account deficit during recent years, which were mainly the result of fluctuations in Australia's trade balance, the most recent increase largely reflected rising payments on Australia's stock of net foreign liabilities – the net income deficit (Graph C1). At 3¾ per cent of GDP, the December quarter 2004 <span class=\"no-wrap\">net income deficit (NID)</span> was the largest recorded since September 1996. ", " The increase in the NID in the second half of 2004 was driven by an increase in income accruing to foreigners on their debt and equity investments in Australia, while returns received on Australian holdings of foreign assets remained broadly unchanged (Graph C2). There was a particularly marked increase in the income attributed to foreign owners of direct equity stakes in Australian firms, which was in contrast to trends in economy-wide measures of profitability, such as gross operating surplus. A substantial fraction of these earnings are not paid out, but retained by the Australian company, and are offset in the balance of payments by an equivalent notional capital inflow.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"r4\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> The latest increase has been almost entirely driven by this component. ", " The large contribution of equity earnings to the recent increase in the NID stands in contrast to earlier episodes of a rising NID, which were mainly driven by developments on the debt side. Ongoing current account deficits have resulted in a steadily rising net foreign liabilities position, from around 25 per cent of GDP in the early 1980s to around 65 per cent of GDP by the end of 2004, over 75 per cent of which are net debt liabilities (Graph C3). The higher level of liabilities that must be serviced would normally have significantly increased the NID over this period, but this effect was substantially offset by trend declines in global interest rates over the past two decades. ", " Looking forward, it is likely that the decline in global interest rates has now run its course, eliminating this source of downward pressure on the NID. As a result, the cost of servicing Australia's net foreign debt liabilities may rise from its current relatively low base, as global interest rates rise and the stock of foreign debt liabilities increases in line with projected ongoing current account deficits. ", " The latest corporate profit reporting season was a strong one. Half-year profits of the 158 companies in the ASX 200 index that reported for the half year to December 2004 amounted to $29 billion, 91 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year (Graph D1). Underlying profits – which exclude significant items such as write-downs – rose by 38 per cent to $25 billion. ", " The growth in underlying profits was broad-based, with 80 per cent of individual companies and nine of the ten broad industry sectors recording an increase in underlying profits (Graph D2). The strongest growth was from companies in the materials sector, whose profits rose by 80 per cent. This was particularly driven by mining companies, whose profits almost doubled from the December half of 2003, benefiting from higher commodity prices and increased production. ", " Aggregate profits were roughly 5 per cent above analysts' expectations, with 70 per cent of individual companies reporting profits that were ahead of expectations. Over the course of the reporting season, market analysts revised up their earnings forecasts for the 2004/05 and 2005/06 financial years. Forecasts of earnings growth for the current financial year were revised up by around 4 percentage points to <span class=\"no-wrap\">36 per cent</span>, while forecasts for growth in 2005/06 were revised up slightly to 9 per cent. The mining industry experienced the largest upward revisions to earnings forecasts, with market analysts expecting profitability to remain high as a result of continued strong demand for commodities. ", " Growth in listed companies' underlying profits of 38 per cent was much faster than the economy-wide measure of profits from the national accounts – gross operating surplus (GOS) – which was up by 6 per cent in the December half year compared with the corresponding period of 2003. This difference is partly due to differences in the treatment of specific components of earnings such as interest, tax and depreciation, and in company coverage. GOS includes unlisted Australian companies and the domestic subsidiaries of non-resident companies, and excludes offshore subsidiaries of Australian companies. As a result, mining and financials companies, which both reported strong profit growth, account for a much larger share of listed companies' profits than of GOS.

In the United States growth remains well entrenched, with another solid outcome being posted in the June quarter. In China the rapid expansion seen over recent years is showing no sign of slackening. The Japanese economy, although not generally a significant contributor to world growth in recent years, now seems to be performing better after some disappointing results in 2004. Growth in the rest of east Asia appears reasonably solid this year, while the main weak spot for the world economy remains the euro area. Overall, most official and private-sector forecasts are that world growth will be above average in 2005 and 2006, though below last year's pace. Higher oil prices in recent months have not generally been viewed as endangering the global expansion, but are seen mainly as a sign of continuing demand pressures. ", " The main news in world financial markets recently was the announcement of new exchange rate arrangements for China, involving an immediate appreciation of 2 per cent against the US dollar and the move to a managed peg. While the initial appreciation was small, the new arrangements provide for greater flexibility of the exchange rate over time. This should be of benefit to China in the medium term, as it will help the authorities to gain greater control over their domestic monetary conditions, and hence to contain inflationary pressures in goods and asset markets more effectively. Most other Asian currencies rose in parallel with the Chinese currency. The Australian dollar was little affected, and remains in the same broad range it has been in since late 2004. Aside from the Chinese announcement, there were few major developments in global markets in recent months. Market expectations of monetary policy tightening in the US have increased a little, with the fed funds rate now expected to reach 4 per cent by the end of the year. Global equity markets have remained strong, underpinned by strong company profit results in all the major countries. ", " In Australia, recent economic data continue to suggest that domestic demand is growing more slowly this year than it was in 2004. Households now seem to have entered a phase in which they are consolidating their balance sheets, borrowing less and increasing their spending less quickly than they were a year or two ago. Combined with the mild downturn now underway in the housing construction cycle, the adjustment in consumer spending is helping to put overall growth in domestic demand onto a more sustainable trend, after the period of rapid growth in demand that was experienced particularly in 2002 and 2003. ", " This adjustment in household balance sheets comes at a time when other factors are continuing to support spending and activity. Employment has been expanding strongly, which is contributing to growth in household incomes, as are the tax cuts that came into effect on 1 July. The boost to national income from rising export prices is continuing to support growth of the economy overall, and the outlook for the farm sector has improved over the past couple of months following widespread rains in the eastern states. It now appears likely that crop production this year will be around average, compared with the well-below-average outcomes that seemed likely three months ago. ", " Recent indicators suggest that conditions in the Australian business sector have remained favourable. The broadest surveys of non-farm businesses are reporting above-average conditions, though they are not as strong as in 2004; capacity utilisation in the June quarter is reported to have remained close to its highest level in more than a decade. Given high levels of capacity utilisation and profits, and the sound balance sheets of the business sector, businesses seem to be in a good position to continue expanding their investment spending. Forward indicators are generally pointing to further growth in aggregate investment, with the prospects for engineering construction activity looking particularly strong. The good condition of the business sector has been reflected in the Australian share market, which has risen strongly this year. ", " There are also signs that the economy is benefiting from an improving international trade performance. Preliminary estimates suggest that growth in import volumes has eased in the first half of this year, while export growth has picked up a little. With export prices up strongly, this has meant a narrowing of the trade deficit, which should also be reflected in lower current account deficits in coming quarters. ", " Overall, while the growth of domestic demand in Australia has eased this year, the economy continues to be characterised by a solid pace of growth in non-farm output and by strong labour market conditions. There are, as always, some regional disparities in economic performance. Relative to the national economy, the larger states (particularly New South Wales) have experienced a more pronounced slowing in demand and activity over the past year, with the other states, particularly resource-rich Western Australia and Queensland, performing more strongly than the national average. ", " Consumer price inflation remained stable at around 2½ per cent over the year to the June quarter, in both headline and underlying terms. Data on producer prices in the quarter suggest that upstream prices are no longer accelerating as they were during the second half of 2004. The recent increases in international oil prices have not yet been fully reflected in the quarterly prices data, and will add to consumer and producer prices in the September quarter. As a result, the annual CPI inflation rate is likely to move somewhat higher than underlying measures in the short term. ", " The outcome for underlying inflation in the June quarter was consistent with the inflation outlook described in the May <em>Statement</em>. The Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is likely to increase gradually from its current level, partly as a result of the fading of exchange rate effects which have been holding the inflation rate down during the past couple of years. Nonetheless, the slowing in domestic demand that has now occurred should help to contain pressures in the medium term. Underlying inflation is forecast to rise to a peak of around 3 per cent by the second half of next year. A possible source of upside risk to this forecast is the tightness of the labour market, which might generate faster growth in labour costs than is currently assumed. On the other hand, the easing in domestic demand could have a larger-than-expected dampening influence, and the current below-trend pace of GDP growth should contribute to some easing in labour market pressures over time. Currently the risks to the forecasts are judged to be evenly balanced, whereas earlier in the year they had appeared to be weighted to the upside. ", " Financial conditions do not appear to be inhibiting the growth of the economy at present. The current level of the cash rate is close to its historical average, and lending rates are still somewhat below average as a result of the increased availability of discounted loans. While overall credit growth has eased from the pace of a year ago, it has only fallen to an annual rate of around 12 per cent. There has, however, been quite a pronounced change in the composition of credit growth. The amount of credit flowing into housing has slowed substantially over the past eighteen months, and this has been associated with a cooling in the housing market. In contrast, business credit has been strengthening during this period. Unlike households, businesses had previously been quite restrained in their use of credit, and they appear to have considerable scope to borrow more to finance further growth in investment. ", " In summary, the economic situation under consideration by the Board at its recent meetings has been characterised by a number of favourable developments. Domestic demand has slowed from its previous rapid pace and is now on a more sustainable trend. Households appear to have entered a period of balance-sheet consolidation. This adjustment is coming at a time when national income is being boosted by the increase in Australia's terms of trade, while the substantial downside risks to the farm sector have eased following recent rains. Overall, the Australian economy is operating at a high level of capacity utilisation, and recent economic data have appeared consistent with an economy growing at a reasonable though not excessive pace. Against this background the Board took the view at its June and July meetings that the medium-term inflation risks were not as strong as they had been earlier in the year. As a result, it decided to hold the cash rate unchanged pending any further information on prices that might prompt a reassessment of the inflation outlook. ", " In the event, June quarter inflation data available for the August meeting indicated that consumer price inflation had remained stable in both headline and underlying terms, while upstream price pressures appeared to have eased. While the Board's judgment remains that underlying inflation is likely to increase over the next year or so, the extent of the increase should be quite limited, unless there is a significant re-acceleration in domestic demand. The latter seems unlikely, although of course it cannot be ruled out entirely. Given this combination of circumstances, the Board decided in August to hold the cash rate unchanged. The Board will continue to monitor developments and make such adjustments as may be required to promote sustainable growth of the economy with low inflation. ", " The global economy has continued to expand at a solid pace. Growth remained strong in the US and China over the first half of 2005, and the Japanese economy has recently picked up following its disappointing performance through much of 2004. In contrast, growth in the rest of east Asia eased in the first half of the year, in line with the slowdown in the growth rate of the global ITC sector, and conditions in the euro area have weakened further. In the face of strong world demand, oil prices have continued to rise, recently trading at over US$60 per barrel, but this has not to date had a major moderating impact on growth expectations. The latest Consensus forecasts are for world growth of 4¼ per cent in both 2005 and 2006, a rate somewhat below the rapid pace set in 2004 but well above the historical average (Table 1). Solid growth in the US and China underlies this outlook, with only modest contributions to growth forecast from the euro area and Japan. Growth in other parts of the world, including Latin America, emerging Europe, India and the Middle East, has also contributed to the strong global outlook. ", " The US economy continues to grow at a solid rate. Real GDP increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, to be 3.6 per cent higher over the year (Graph 1). The quarterly result reflected robust contributions to growth from domestic final demand and net exports, partly offset by a rundown in inventories. ", " Consumption grew by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter and by 3.9 per cent over the year, supported by firm labour market conditions, further increases in household wealth and a recovery in consumer confidence. Labour market developments have continued to be favourable: non-farm payrolls increased by 1.6 per cent over the year to June (Graph 2); the unemployment rate fell to 5.0 per cent in June, the lowest rate since September 2001; and initial jobless claims have settled at around 320,000, which has traditionally been associated with monthly payrolls gains of more than 200,000. ", " Low interest rates and large gains in house prices have continued to underpin strength in house building. Dwelling investment grew by 5.8 per cent over the year to the June quarter and is at an historically high share of GDP <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 3)</span>. House prices advanced by 12.5 per cent over the year to the March quarter. In some regions, such as Florida, California and Nevada, house prices have grown by more than 20 per cent over the past year, which has elicited concerns in the US about potential overvaluation of house prices. ", " Indicators from the business sector are favourable. In the June quarter, investment increased by 2.2 per cent to be 9.2 per cent higher over the year, as high levels of internal funding, combined with accommodative external financing conditions, have continued to underpin the investment upswing. Core capital goods orders, which are a forward indicator of equipment investment, were up by 13 per cent over the year to June. Corporate profits increased by 12.3 per cent over the year to the March quarter and, as a share of GDP, are around the peak reached in 1997, which was the highest level since the late 1960s. Measures of business sentiment remain at above-average levels. ", " The US current account deficit reached 6.4 per cent of GDP in the March quarter. Net exports contributed to growth for the first time in almost two years in the June quarter, as export growth picked up and imports fell. Over the year, export volumes grew by 8 per cent, outpacing growth of 5 per cent in imports. ", " Inflation has remained contained, despite a sharp 4.3 per cent increase in unit labour costs over the year to the March quarter and the persistence of high oil prices. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased by 2.0 per cent over the year to June, and the chain price index for personal consumption expenditure increased by 1.9 per cent (Graph 4). The Federal Reserve has continued to remove its policy accommodation, lifting the federal funds rate by a further 25 basis points to 3.25 per cent at its June meeting and foreshadowing future increases. ", " The Japanese economy appears to be showing greater strength after faltering during 2004. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 1.2 per cent in the March quarter, to be 0.9 per cent higher over the year (Graph 5). The March quarter's strong result may overstate the true strength of the economy, just as the previous three quarters' GDP figures may have understated it. However, improvements in the labour market, the healthier state of corporate balance sheets and the higher levels of consumer and business sentiment suggest that the present expansion in activity may prove to be more durable than the short-lived upswings seen in earlier years. ", " The outlook for consumer spending is positive. Consumption increased by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter and consumer sentiment is at a high level, buoyed by improving labour market conditions. Employment continues to expand at a moderate pace; payrolls grew by 0.6 per cent over the year to June, and the unemployment rate was 4.2 per cent, its lowest level in almost seven years. Employment growth of late has been concentrated in full-time positions for the first time in almost 10 years (Graph 6). Leading indicators of employment growth are positive, with measures of hiring intentions from business surveys above their long-run average levels. ", " The slowdown in the global ITC sector has constrained the recovery of the corporate sector, although overall conditions are improving. ITC inventories are still at a high level and total merchandise export volumes increased by just 4 per cent over the year to June, down from almost 20 per cent a year earlier. Nevertheless, the fundamentals have strengthened: corporate profits after interest grew by 14 per cent over the year to the March quarter; firms have reduced excess labour and improved their balance sheets; and capacity appears to be stretched in the manufacturing sector. In addition, investment intentions in the June quarter Tankan survey were revised upwards substantially, and the manufacturing PMI and the Economy Watchers survey have also trended upwards since the start of the year. ", " Banking sector balance sheets are also looking healthier. The Financial Services Agency recently announced that the major banks met the government's targeted reduction in non-performing loans for the period to March 2005. Further, the pace of decline in underlying bank lending has slowed to only 0.3 per cent over the year to June, compared with almost 3 per cent in mid 2002. ", " Domestic corporate goods prices increased by 1.4 per cent over the year to June due to high oil and commodity prices. Nevertheless, there is still mild deflation in prices at the consumer level. The core CPI, which excludes fresh food prices, fell by 0.2 per cent over the year to June and would have declined further if energy products were also excluded. Another factor contributing to falling consumer prices in recent months has been a decline in electricity and telephone charges following deregulation. ", " The rapid expansion in the Chinese economy continued in the first half of 2005, with real GDP reported to have increased by 9½ per cent over the year to the June quarter. The shift in the mix of growth away from investment seems not to have continued; after slowing over the first half of 2004, growth in urban fixed investment has picked up to 29 per cent over the year to June, well above the official target for 2005 of <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span>. Retail sales grew by 13 per cent over the year to June. ", " Industrial production grew by 17 per cent over the year to June, compared with 14 per cent over 2004. Exports have continued to grow rapidly, to be 30 per cent higher over the year to June, while import growth remains sluggish by recent standards, at around 16 per cent over the same period (Graph 7). This has resulted in a widening trade surplus that is likely to result in a sizeable current account surplus in 2005. ", " The growth rates of money and credit have remained relatively strong, at 16 and 13 per cent respectively over the year to June. Growth in consumer prices remains well contained at 1.6 per cent over the year to June; excluding food, consumer price inflation was 1.5 per cent. Price pressure remains more evident at the producer level, with producer price inflation at 5.2 per cent over the year to June. Growth in property prices, however, eased to 8 per cent over the year to the June quarter following official measures to curb speculative activity, and this easing has been most pronounced in the cities that experienced the most rapid growth in property prices, such as Shanghai. On 21 July, the renminbi was revalued by 2.1 per cent against the US dollar and its value will henceforth be managed with reference to an undisclosed basket of currencies (for further details see the ‘<a href=\"#international-and-foreign-exchange-markets\">International and Foreign Exchange Markets</a>’ chapter in this <em>Statement)</em>. ", " Growth in the rest of east Asia has continued to moderate somewhat, but remains generally firm. Real GDP for the region increased by 3.8 per cent over the year to the March quarter. Growth in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines has been boosted by robust domestic demand and buoyant commodity markets, while in Hong Kong the economy is benefiting from increasing integration with China (Graph 8). Growth was slower in Singapore, Taiwan and Korea, reflecting ongoing inventory adjustments associated with the slowdown in growth of the global ITC sector (for further details see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A</a>: Developments in the ITC Sector’). However, growth appears to have picked up in the June quarter in Singapore and Korea. ", " Export growth has slowed over the past year, but appears to have stabilised at an annual rate of just over <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span>. Exports in south-east Asia have been boosted by high commodity demand. In recent months, ITC exports from Asia have started to improve, recording growth of around 10 per cent in the three months to June. Industrial production has levelled out, after falling in early 2005, to be 2.0 per cent higher over the year to May. ", " Domestic demand growth has been firm across most of the region, with retail sales remaining buoyant, supported by improving labour markets, low interest rates and rising asset prices. Growth has been somewhat weaker in Thailand and Korea. Confidence in Thailand has been affected by several factors, including the tsunami, unrest in the south and a drought. The Thai government has recently undertaken expansionary policies focused on construction in the tsunami-affected areas and on infrastructure more broadly. Growth in Korea has been subdued, but the recovery of domestic demand is progressing, as the repair of household balance sheets appears to be nearing its end. Consumption increased for the fourth consecutive quarter in June, and employment grew by 1.9 per cent over the year to June. ", " High crude oil and other commodity prices continue to boost headline consumer prices in the region, although there is significant variation in inflation rates across countries. While annual inflation has been very low in Singapore and Hong Kong, price increases have been larger in Thailand and Malaysia, boosted in both cases by reductions in fuel subsidies. Inflationary pressures prompted the Bank of Thailand to increase its policy rate by <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 basis points</span> in both June and July to a level of 2.75 per cent, and Taiwan's central bank also continued to remove its monetary policy accommodation. Inflation in Indonesia has remained above 7 per cent and was <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.8 per cent</span> over the year to July. Bank Indonesia has been tightening monetary policy, and in early July adopted a formal inflation-targeting policy framework. On 21 July, Malaysia moved to a managed float of the ringgit against a basket of currencies. ", " In India, real GDP increased by 7.1 per cent over the year to the March quarter. The manufacturing and services sectors made the strongest contributions to growth, while agricultural output increased only modestly. Growth in industrial production was 10.8 per cent over the year to May, having recovered from a sharp dip earlier in the year that was associated with coal shortages. Export growth has eased significantly, to 19 per cent over the year to June compared with over 40 per cent a year earlier, but imports have continued to grow strongly, rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">30 per cent</span> over the year to June. Wholesale price inflation has been moderating over the past year and was <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.1 per cent</span> in June. ", " In New Zealand, economic growth has eased from the rapid pace recorded in early 2004. Real GDP increased by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter, to be 2.5 per cent higher over the year. Domestic final demand expanded by 2.0 per cent in the quarter, as residential construction bounced back after declining in the previous two quarters, and consumption and business investment growth remained firm. Net exports subtracted from growth in the quarter, as export volumes fell by 2½ per cent. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has held the official cash rate at 6.75 per cent since March. CPI inflation was 0.9 per cent in the June quarter, leaving the year-ended rate unchanged at 2.8 per cent. ", " Economic conditions in the euro area have deteriorated, as domestic demand has failed to compensate for the weakening external impetus. Euro-wide GDP grew by 1.4 per cent over the year to the March quarter, and while quarterly growth picked up to 0.5 per cent, it was entirely attributable to a fall in imports, with no growth in domestic demand (Table 2). German GDP was estimated to have grown by 1.0 per cent in the March quarter, but this quarterly result may have been overstated by working-day adjustments. Growth slowed in France, and GDP contracted in Italy and the Netherlands. Of the major euro area economies, only Spain is growing steadily, with activity underpinned by strong house price gains and an investment boom. ", " Recent indicators suggest euro area growth lost further momentum in the second quarter. The surge in industrial orders at the end of 2004 has now been largely unwound. After a temporary bounce in April, production fell by 0.3 per cent in May to be unchanged from its level a year earlier, and the manufacturing PMI was below the break-even 50 level during the June quarter. Year-ended export growth has moderated from more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> in mid 2004 to 6 per cent in May, as exporters have faced an appreciating euro and rising input costs. Across the euro area, the decline in production and exports has depressed business confidence, which has dropped to below-average levels (Graph 9). ", " Indicators from the household sector remain subdued, weighed down by low confidence, uncertainty about the course of reforms and a sluggish labour market. Euro-wide consumption growth slowed in the March quarter, and consumption declined in Germany, with weak confidence and reductions to unemployment benefits offsetting the potential boost from income tax cuts. Recent retail sales data remained weak in Germany and Italy, and retail sales growth has eased in France. The euro-wide unemployment rate remained high, at 8.7 per cent in June. ", " While higher energy costs have lifted producer price inflation, the European Commission survey indicates that firms have not fully passed these input cost increases on to consumers. Year-ended consumer price inflation has fluctuated around the ECB's 2 per cent reference rate since the start of the year, and was 2.2 per cent in July, with underlying inflation lower at 1.4 per cent in June. The ECB has continued to hold the repo rate steady at <span class=\"no-wrap\">2 per cent</span>. ", " The pace of growth of the UK economy has slowed, as the cooling housing market dampens consumer spending and external demand has eased. Preliminary data suggest GDP growth was 0.4 per cent in the June quarter and eased to 1.7 per cent over the year, compared with 3.7 per cent a year earlier. House prices in the UK remained broadly unchanged during the first half of 2005, compared with year-ended growth of around 20 per cent a year ago, and the value of housing loan approvals in June was 15 per cent below its late 2003 peak (Graph 10). While consumer confidence has eased in recent months, it remains above average levels. This may reflect the strength of the labour market; the unemployment rate remains low and average earnings growth is still around trend at <span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> in year-ended terms. ", " Inflation remains well contained, with consumer price inflation at 2 per cent over the year to June and underlying inflation at 1.4 per cent over the same period. The Bank of England has held the repo rate at 4.75 per cent since August 2004. ", " Broadly speaking, global foreign exchange markets have been quiet over the past three months, apart from the activity around the announcement by Chinese authorities on 21 July of changes to their exchange rate regime. The renminbi will now be pegged to a basket of currencies, rather than solely to the US dollar. At the end of each day, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) now announces the exchange rate of the renminbi against a number of currencies in the basket for the following trading day. Daily fluctuations in the renminbi will then be contained to a narrow trading band, e.g. ±0.3 per cent against the US dollar. This exchange rate regime shares a number of similarities with that in place in Australia prior to the floating of the Australian dollar in December 1983. ", " At the time of the announcement, the renminbi was revalued by 2.1 per cent against the US dollar (Graph 11). Since then the reference rate to the US dollar has moved marginally both upward and downward on a daily basis. The non-deliverable forward market for the renminbi implies that the market is expecting a further 4½ per cent appreciation against the US dollar over the next year. However, recent statements from the PBoC have stressed that no further major movement in the exchange rate is in prospect. ", " One hour after the Chinese announcement, Malaysia announced that it too was abandoning its peg to the <span class=\"no-wrap\">US dollar</span> which had been in place since the Asian crisis. It has moved to a managed float against a basket of currencies similar to the regime in place in Singapore. Prior to these developments, in late May the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced a trading band for the Hong Kong dollar of 7.75 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.85 per US dollar</span>. This was intended to address concerns over trading in the Hong Kong dollar as a speculative vehicle for the renminbi. Previously, the HKMA imposed a strict limit of 7.80 on the extent to which the currency could depreciate, but had no explicit boundary on the extent of appreciation. ", " The Japanese yen, Korean won, Thai baht and Singaporean dollar all appreciated by around 2 per cent against the US dollar immediately following the announcement by the PBoC (Graph 12). The Malaysian ringgit appreciated by a smaller amount in the first few days of its new regime. ", " Prior to the Chinese developments, the US dollar continued the appreciation that had been occurring since the start of the year, reflecting the ongoing tightening of monetary policy in the US and the publication of strong data on the US economy (Graph 13). Despite some initial volatility around the time of the Chinese announcement, the US dollar has subsequently remained relatively stable. In trade-weighted terms it is around 2½ per cent higher so far this year. ", " Developments in expectations about the future path of short-term interest rates have also had an important influence on foreign exchange markets in some countries over the past three months (Table 3). Reflecting heightened expectations of an easing in monetary policy (see below), the British pound has declined against the US dollar since early June. Similarly, the New Zealand dollar fell as expectations about further monetary policy tightening were scaled back. In contrast, the Canadian dollar appreciated noticeably, reflecting expectations of rate increases in the near term. ", " In Latin America, most currencies have appreciated against the US dollar, notwithstanding a temporary sharp fall in the Brazilian real following allegations of corruption against the government. ", " On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar has appreciated since the last <em>Statement</em>, as international investors have remained favourably disposed to the currency, largely because of the strong gains that are taking place in Australia's terms of trade. During the period the trade-weighted index reached its highest point since early 2004 and is towards the top end of its post-float range (Graph 14). ", " Against the US dollar, which as noted was on an upward trend through much of the period, the Australian dollar slipped a little in net terms. Apart from two weeks in July where it fell below US75 cents, it has generally stayed in the US75–80 cent range in which it has been trading since late 2004. ", " Against other currencies, the Australian dollar recorded some big moves (Graph 15). It rose by around 4 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> against the euro and the yen, and 6 per cent against the UK pound, to reach multi-year highs. It also appreciated noticeably against the NZ dollar as expectations were scaled back of any further tightening in monetary policy there. The Australian dollar was affected temporarily by the Chinese exchange rate announcement in July, moving higher against the US dollar and other non-Asian currencies, but depreciating against Asian currencies. Most of these developments were unwound within a few days. ", " The favourable investor sentiment towards the Australian dollar is illustrated by the fact that speculative positions in the Australian dollar against the US dollar on the Chicago Futures Exchange remain net long, one of only two currencies for which this is the case (the Canadian dollar is the other). The net long positions were, however, smaller than earlier in 2005 (Graph 16). ", " Volatility in the Australian dollar has increased since the last <em>Statement</em>, including around the time of the Chinese exchange rate announcement (Graph 17). However, estimates of volatility that market makers are pricing into options (so-called implied volatility) have not moved as significantly, suggesting that markets are unconvinced that the lift in volatility is likely to be sustained. ", " With official reserve assets at relatively comfortable levels and the Australian dollar mostly trading in a range of US75 to US80 cents since late 2004, the Bank has been opportunistic in adding further to its reserve holdings at attractive prices. Over the past quarter the Bank added a net $500 million to net reserves, with the largest purchases in June when the Australian dollar moved above US77 cents. Overall, net reserves increased from <span class=\"no-wrap\">$26 billion</span> at the end of April to $26½ billion at the end of July. The Bank's holdings of foreign exchange under swap agreements increased by around $5 billion over the three months to $30¾ billion, as the Bank continued to make use of swaps to help with domestic liquidity management. ", " The US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by a further 25 basis points, to 3.25 per cent, at its June meeting (Graph 18). The Fed has now raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at every meeting since it commenced tightening in June 2004, for a total increase of 225 basis points. Over the past three months, markets have brought forward their expectations of future tightening following indications that the US economy remains strong and the testimony to Congress by Chairman Greenspan. Currently market pricing anticipates the fed funds rate reaching 4 per cent by the end of the year, with little tightening priced in beyond that. A noticeable feature of the current tightening cycle, however, has been that the market has consistently underestimated the extent of the Fed's policy moves. Following each tightening since June 2004, the market has typically priced in a probability that the Fed would tighten at only about 75 per cent of meetings over the subsequent six months. As noted, in the event, the Fed has tightened at every meeting. ", " The European Central Bank (ECB) left its policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent over the past three months, as it has done since June 2003 (Graph 19). Through May and June, markets were pricing in the possibility of an interest rate cut by the end of the year, reflecting disappointing growth prospects in the euro area. However, recent comments from ECB officials downplaying the possibility of a rate reduction have seen these expectations revert to unchanged policy for the foreseeable future. ", " Similarly, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has not changed monetary policy for several years, with interest rates remaining at zero. It has instead sought to boost the liquidity of the banking system by supplying excess reserves to banks. With the banking system and the economy on the mend, the BoJ is no longer as concerned to maintain excess liquidity and in May foreshadowed that it would allow banks' reserves to fall if demand for them declined. This change is largely technical in nature and has little implication for the overall stance of monetary policy. ", " While policy rates in the UK have remained unchanged over the past three months, four of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England (BoE) voted for an interest rate cut at the latest meeting, reflecting weaker economic data and contained inflationary pressures. Currently, the market expects the BoE to reduce interest rates by 50 basis points over the coming months, to 4.25 per cent. Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden cut official rates in June by a larger-than-anticipated 50 basis points to 1.5 per cent, while Norway raised its official rate by 25 basis points to 2 per cent at its June meeting. ", " In other industrialised countries, policy settings in Canada and New Zealand have remained unchanged over the <em>Statement</em> period. However, expectations about future policy moves have changed in both countries. Reflecting comments by the Bank of Canada that a reduction in current monetary stimulus will be required in the near-term, markets currently expect rates to rise by 25 basis points, to 2.75 per cent, later in the year. In New Zealand there has been a notable scaling back in expectations for further rate rises. ", " In emerging markets, China introduced further administrative measures to address price pressures in the housing market, including a prohibition on the resale of unfinished properties until construction is complete, a sales tax on residential properties sold within two years of purchase, and the removal of land-use rights for sites that have remained idle for more than two years. Interest rates on foreign-currency-denominated deposits were also raised to stem speculative pressure on the renminbi at the same time as the exchange rate regime was changed. ", " Indonesia's central bank implemented a change in its monetary policy regime, shifting from a money supply target to an interest rate target. It has also adopted a formal inflation target of 6 per cent for the current year, and <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> for 2006. In other emerging markets, Poland, Turkey and Hungary eased policy rates, citing reduced inflation concerns, while Thailand, Taiwan, Chile and Brazil tightened monetary policy due to rising inflationary pressures. ", " Over the past three months, yields on US 10-year bonds have risen from a little under 4 per cent to over <span class=\"no-wrap\">4¼ per cent</span> following data indicating that US economic growth remains strong (Graph 20). Broadly, however, yields remain in the 4–4½ per cent range they have been in for much of the past year, even though the Fed has raised short-term interest rates by 225 basis points over the period. The small rise in nominal yields in the latest three months was due to an increase in real yields, as indicated by the yield on indexed bonds which is currently around 2 per cent. ", " Euro area yields have remained at low levels over the past three months, reflecting the subdued growth outlook for the region. The spread between German 10-year government bonds and US Treasuries widened to around 100 basis points, to be the widest in five years. After reaching a new post-War low of 3.1 per cent, German yields rose a little following comments from ECB officials dispelling the possibility of an easing in monetary policy. Japanese government yields rose reflecting better-than-expected economic data and renewed optimism about the economic outlook. ", " Although they have risen a little recently, bond yields in global markets continue to trade at low levels by historical standards. The reasons for this continue to be debated by analysts. As discussed in the May <em>Statement</em>, the explanations that have been advanced to explain the low level of yields include a glut of savings, particularly in the Asian region, the low rates of inflation globally, increased credibility of central banks in controlling inflation which has reduced term premiums, and changes to pension fund arrangements which have encouraged a switch from investment in equities to bonds. ", " The widening in spreads of lower grade US corporate debt that occurred earlier in the year has been largely unwound over the past three months (Graph 21). The move up in US corporate spreads had been driven mainly by the automotive and automotive parts sectors as markets responded to the ratings downgrades of General Motors and Ford, but these concerns have now waned. Emerging market sovereign spreads declined, particularly in Latin America following the successful negotiation of a debt restructure by Argentina. ", " After a relatively lacklustre performance in the first part of 2005, global equity markets have risen strongly since the last <em>Statement</em>, reflecting renewed optimism about the sustainability of the US economic recovery and the outlook for world growth more generally (Graph 22). Equity markets in the US have risen by over 5 per cent over the past three months, with the technology dependent NASDAQ rising to a four-year high aided by better-than-expected earnings reports by key stocks. ", " Notwithstanding the weak economic conditions and outlook in Europe, the corporate sector in that region is achieving good financial outcomes and equity markets in the region have generally outperformed other major markets by a considerable margin over the past three months and over the year as a whole (Table 4). The Euro STOXX index has risen by more than 10 per cent since the last <em>Statement</em>, while in the UK the FTSE has recorded only a slightly smaller rise, notwithstanding a short-lived decline following the London bombings. Japanese equities have also risen solidly. The improved economic outlook for Japan has been generally favourable for equities, although high commodity prices have limited the gains. ", " Share prices in emerging Asia and Latin America have also on average risen strongly since the previous <em>Statement</em>. In Asia, the Indian share market recorded very sharp gains of around 25 per cent, while share prices in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Indonesia also experienced double-digit growth over the period. ", " The one main exception to the strength in global equity markets has been China, where despite the very strong growth in the Chinese economy, concerns about how the government will dispose of its holdings of non-traded shares in state-owned enterprises have depressed the market (Graph 23). China's foreign-currency denominated B Shares, (which are available to both foreign and domestic investors) have fared particularly poorly, declining by around 15 per cent over the past three months. However China's local currency denominated A Shares (which are restricted to local investors and approved foreign investors) have fallen somewhat less, declining by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> over the same period. ", " Growth in domestic expenditure has slowed over the past few quarters, but still continues at a solid rate. Gross national expenditure (GNE) increased by 1 per cent in the March quarter and by 3½ per cent over the year, compared with 6¼ per cent over the previous four quarters (Table 5). This slowing in demand partly reflected a softening in household consumption, perhaps a result of balance sheet consolidation by some households. The downturn in dwelling construction was also an important driver of the slowing, as was the fall in spending on equipment investment in the March quarter after strong growth in this component in earlier quarters. ", " Net exports continued to subtract from growth in the March quarter, but to a lesser extent than in 2004, as exports grew solidly and growth in imports moderated a little. Overall, real GDP is estimated to have risen by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.7 per cent</span> in the March quarter, and by a little less than 2 per cent over the year. Growth in the non-farm sector was somewhat stronger, at 2½ per cent, with total production restrained by a 16 per cent drop in farm GDP. The terms of trade continue to impart a significant stimulus to income, such that real gross domestic income increased by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter and by 3½ per cent over the year. ", " The economy seems likely to remain on a moderate growth path through 2005. The large gains in the terms of trade should continue to support domestic spending, and the recent rainfalls suggest that farm production is unlikely to fall to the extent that was earlier feared. Growth in household consumption may persist at more moderate rates than seen over recent years, but it should be supported by favourable labour market conditions and consumer sentiment, as well as the boost to incomes from recent Budget initiatives. Further, recent data have tended to confirm the expectation that the downturn in housing construction will be much milder than in past cycles. Similarly, while some indicators point to an easing in business investment growth, sentiment and profitability in the business sector remain positive, and capacity utilisation levels are high. A slowing in domestic demand growth to more sustainable rates, coupled with signs of a recovery in exports, should reduce the drag on growth from net exports. ", " Household consumption has slowed from the unsustainable rates seen in 2003 and early 2004, but its pace of growth has been fairly solid so far in 2005. In the March quarter, consumer spending rose by 0.8 per cent to be 3½ per cent higher over the year, which compares with the peak annual growth rate of more than 6 per cent in early 2004. Expenditure on goods increased by 1½ per cent in the quarter, while growth in spending on services slowed further. More recently, the volume of retail sales rose by a modest 0.2 per cent in the June quarter, partly reflecting a dip in sales at the start of the quarter, as warmer than usual weather depressed sales by department stores and clothing &amp; soft goods retailers; higher petrol prices are also likely to have weighed on consumer spending in the quarter (Graph 24). Motor vehicle sales fell by 1.9 per cent in the June quarter, but this follows the boost to sales from the tariff cut at the beginning of the year, and the level of sales remains high. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute measure of consumer sentiment has eased since the start of 2005, though it is still above long-run average levels. ", " Household income growth has moderated relative to the rates of a year or two ago, but continued strength in the labour market, the tax cuts on 1 July and other fiscal measures in the May Budget all suggest that incomes and consumer spending will remain well-supported in the period ahead. There are nonetheless a few signs that some households are becoming more financially cautious, after a long period in which debt and debt-servicing costs rose rapidly (Graph 25). The household saving ratio increased slightly over the year to the March quarter, after declining for many years. Although debt growth continues to outpace that of income, it has slowed to its lowest quarterly rate in more than six years. Some indicators of financial stress – such as loan arrears – have risen a little, though they remain low relative to historical experience. The household sector switched to injecting equity into housing in the quarter after four years of equity withdrawal (Graph 26). As was the case during the upswing in equity withdrawal, not all of this turnaround is likely to be reflected in consumption spending, as households may have also used these funds for other purposes such as the purchase of financial assets. ", " Following falls in building approvals from late 2003 and in commencements from mid 2004, the downturn in residential building has continued into 2005. Dwelling investment recorded a further decline in the March quarter, contracting by ½ per cent to be nearly 4 per cent lower over the year. Both new dwelling construction and alterations and additions activity fell in the quarter, and industry surveys, such as that by the Master Builders Association, suggest that further modest falls in residential building construction are likely in coming quarters. In the current cycle, both building approvals and commencements have fallen by around 15 per cent from their peaks, while new dwelling construction to date has fallen by only 6 per cent. Nevertheless, the large amount of work in the pipeline should continue to provide support to construction in the short term. This is consistent with the relatively optimistic responses of builders to industry surveys about their own near-term prospects. ", " Forward indicators of housing construction have generally stabilised over recent months. The downturn in building approvals looks to have largely run its course, supporting earlier expectations for a relatively mild downturn in dwelling activity by historical standards. After remaining flat during late 2004, the number of building approvals for houses picked up in the three months to June, to reach similar levels to those seen a year earlier (Graph 27). In recent months, the number of loan approvals for new construction has increased and the Housing Industry Association's measure of new home sales (which are commitments to build) has picked up, driven by strength in Western Australia and Victoria. Indicators of construction in New South Wales, however, generally remain subdued. In most states, incentives offered by state governments appear to have attracted re-entry of first-home buyers. Approvals in the volatile medium-density sector stabilised in the first half of 2005, but remained around <span class=\"no-wrap\">10 per cent</span> lower than the average in 2004. The value of approvals for alterations and additions remains weak, and is well below the peak in July 2004. ", " Lending for housing remains above its 2004 average, but has softened in recent months, perhaps in part a response to the rising debt-service burden. The value of monthly housing loan approvals has fallen steadily since its 2005 peak of $14.1 billion in February, to $13 billion in May (Graph 28). Both the owner-occupier and investor components have fallen, but the decline has been most marked in the investor component. Housing credit growth continues to moderate, running at an annualised rate of 10.9 per cent in the six months to June, around half the peak rates seen in late 2003. ", " The various measures of nationwide house prices suggest little change in prices in the March and June quarters. House prices in Sydney and Melbourne are either unchanged or slightly weaker and continue to weigh on the nationwide measure. Prices have been broadly flat in the other capitals, with the exception of Perth, where they continue to rise (for more detail, see ‘<a href=\"#box-b\">Box B: Recent Developments in Housing Prices</a>’). Recent auction results also suggest subdued demand. Across all capital cities, auction clearance rates have been broadly the same as, or a little higher than, at the same time last year, but they remain significantly weaker than their recent historical averages. Anecdotal reports suggest that the small increases in auction clearance rates in some cities reflect greater recognition by vendors of the softer market conditions relative to the boom conditions of 2003. Auction volumes in Melbourne and Sydney remain similar to this time last year, but weaker than seen in previous years. ", " Recent data point to firmer conditions in rental housing markets. Vacancy rates in all state capitals have been trending down and in the March quarter stood around or below their average levels since the start of the 1980s. Data from the Consumer Price Index point to continued modest growth in rents; however, data from the REIA and state tenancy authorities suggest a pick-up in median weekly rents for three-bedroom houses over the year to the March quarter, and modest increases in rents for two-bedroom apartments. Despite strengthening conditions in rental markets and subdued house prices, rental yields remain very low. ", " The business sector overall continues to experience generally favourable conditions, although the various surveys still point to an easing in conditions since late 2004 (Graph 29). The June quarter NAB survey of the non-farm sector reported that business conditions were steady in the quarter and remain consistent with solid production growth. Capacity utilisation remains at high levels, particularly in the mining sector, while a large number of firms continue to cite the availability of suitable labour as a key constraint on output (Graph 30). The June quarter ACCI Survey of Investor Confidence, which also covers the non-farm sector, likewise reported that business conditions have eased, but remain at above-average levels, while expected conditions for respondents' own businesses remain around long-run levels. Similar trends have been seen in the Sensis survey of small and medium businesses, though assessments of current and future conditions are generally more subdued. Lack of work and sales have become more of a concern among respondents, consistent with some slowing in domestic demand, though the ability to find quality staff remains a significant issue. Consistent with business surveys, capacity constraints continue to be reported in liaison and are affecting the ability of firms to expand production in some industries. However, as the housing cycle matures, capacity constraints are reported to have eased in the residential construction industry. ", " In line with trends in the wider economy, the manufacturing sector has also reported weaker conditions compared with late 2004, but the surveys suggest broadly unchanged conditions in the June quarter. According to the latest ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers, actual business conditions in the manufacturing sector improved slightly in the June quarter 2005. Both actual and expected business conditions remained above long-run levels, but were down on the high levels seen towards the end of last year, while business confidence was more subdued. The latest quarterly AIG survey of manufacturing was somewhat more pessimistic, suggesting that activity in the sector weakened slightly in the June quarter, with key indicators at or below long-run levels. More recently, the AIG Performance of Manufacturing Index fell sharply in July to be well below its long-run average. ", " Following protracted dry conditions, prospects for the farm sector have improved in recent months. National forecasts made prior to recent rains predicted a below-average wheat crop, but more recent forecasts by state departments of agriculture and private-sector agencies now suggest that it will be close to the average of the past five years. Encouragingly, the Bureau of Meteorology suggests that the risk of <span lang=\"es\">El Niño</span> conditions emerging later this year has fallen sharply in recent months. However, risks to the outlook appear to be on the downside, given that yields tend to be much lower when planting is late, and because the extent of rain prevented planting in some cases. Furthermore, while the rains have improved the outlook for both grain and livestock production, they have done little to alleviate the critical shortage of stored water. Consequently, much of eastern Australia remains drought-declared. ", " Corporate profitability remains strong, with above-average growth around the turn of the year leaving gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations 8.3 per cent higher over the year to the March quarter. This reflects the fact that profits of mining firms have been growing particularly strongly, benefiting from robust world demand and strong commodity prices (Graph 31). The recent large increases in bulk commodity prices will continue to affect revenues and profits over the coming year. Meanwhile, profit growth in the domestically focused sectors has slowed over the past year, largely reflecting the moderation in domestic demand and rising costs. The profitability of the unincorporated sector weakened in the quarter, to be 1.5 per cent lower over the year, mainly resulting from subdued conditions in the farm sector. ", " Businesses continue to have ample access to external financing. Business credit has been strong, growing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">11½ per</span> cent over the year to June, while non-intermediated debt outstanding increased by around 18 per cent. Meanwhile, net equity raisings have generally been above their five-year average over the past six months, though some occasional large equity buybacks have partly offset this. These buybacks most likely reflect the recent strong profitability of many firms, which has resulted in them accumulating surplus cash reserves. ", " Buoyed by strong profitability and high capacity utilisation, business investment has enjoyed a strong upswing over the past three years (Graph 32). Most recently, investment declined in the March quarter 2005, but this follows rapid growth in the December quarter and the level of investment is still more than 10 per cent higher than a year earlier. Machinery and equipment spending fell sharply in the quarter as imports of civil aircraft fell from their high December quarter level. In contrast, non-residential construction activity grew solidly, with further strong growth in engineering construction more than offsetting a modest decline in the building component. ", " The favourable conditions underpinning recent growth in business investment remain in place, including a positive external funding environment, with sharply higher commodity prices adding further support to profitability. Nevertheless, survey indicators of firms' investment intentions point to some divergence in the outlook for the different components of investment, with a marked easing in the pace of real equipment investment growth compared with previous years, as the investment cycle matures, and continued strength in engineering construction. ", " While it is only a preliminary indicator of actual spending at this stage, the latest capital expenditure (Capex) survey points to a levelling out in machinery and equipment investment in 2005/06, following strong growth in 2004/05. Within the total, equipment spending intentions for the manufacturing sector point to a solid rise, consistent with the above-average level of spending suggested by the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers. Industry bodies also report a notable increase in the volume of farm equipment purchased in recent months, and the latest Rabobank survey suggests that investment intentions for farm equipment (which are not covered in the Capex survey) are close to their pre-drought levels. ", " Forward-looking indicators of non-residential construction point to further growth in coming quarters. Growth in engineering construction activity is expected to be supported by work currently underway on a number of large road construction and resource-related projects, such as the EastLink motorway in Melbourne ($2.5 billion) and Alcan's alumina refinery expansion in the Northern Territory ($1.9 billion). In contrast, the near-term outlook for building activity is weaker, with the recent level of work approved running a little below the current high level of construction. ", " The Australian Government Budget for 2005/06, delivered in May, showed a considerable increase in the expected budget surplus in both underlying cash and accrual terms (Graph 33). This upward revision reflects a larger revenue base in 2004/05 – owing to stronger than expected employment growth through 2004 – and higher forecast company taxation revenue, partly driven by the stronger outlook for the terms of trade. These effects more than offset a range of new policy measures announced in the Budget, including further personal income tax cuts, an increase in assistance through the Family Tax Benefit, a range of measures aimed at improving workforce participation, and higher spending on defence and national security. The budget aggregates imply that the fiscal position of the Australian Government will be little changed in 2005/06 and therefore will have a broadly neutral effect on the growth in demand. State government budgets in aggregate are estimated to have a mildly expansionary impact, underpinned by increased infrastructure investment. ", " Strong labour market conditions persisted in the June quarter. Employment rose by 3.4 per cent over the year, bringing total employment to just over 10 million in June (Graph 34). Full-time employment continued to accelerate, increasing by 3.3 per cent over the year. The employment expansion over the first six months of 2005 was accompanied by a rise in the participation rate of three-quarters of a percentage point, while the unemployment rate fell from 5.1 per cent to 5.0 per cent. ", " There has been some convergence in labour market conditions across the mainland states since the beginning of 2005 (Table 6). Employment growth in New South Wales, which has persistently lagged the other states, increased to 1.7 per cent over the year to the June quarter, buoyed by a recovery in the business services sector. Employment growth in Queensland moderated to 5.6 per cent, but remains at the top of the range of state outcomes, closely followed by growth in Western Australia. In addition, the states with the highest unemployment rates mid last year have experienced the largest falls over the past year. ", " Employment in most industries continued to expand over the year to the June quarter, with employment growth of more than 5 per cent in the mining, retail and construction industries. In addition, the contribution from service industries strengthened, as the recovery in business services employment continued and employment in most household services industries rebounded. Outcomes in the education, manufacturing and rural sectors weighed on aggregate employment growth. ", " Forward-looking labour demand indicators moderated over the June quarter, but generally remain at high levels suggesting further, but more moderate, near-term gains in employment. The NAB and ACCI-Westpac measures of employment intentions remain above long-run averages, although the ACCI-Westpac measure eased again in the June quarter (Graph 35). The ABS measure of vacancies decreased slightly in the June quarter, but as a proportion of the labour force it is still considerably higher than a year ago. According to the ANZ measures, the number of internet-based vacancies has eased only slightly from its peak in late 2004, while print-based vacancies in June were below levels seen a year ago. Liaison reports suggest that skill shortages in specialised occupations are still acute. Shortages are becoming more widespread across industries and occupations, but remain most pronounced among skilled workers in the non-residential construction and resources sectors, and in parts of the business services sector. ", " After several years of lacklustre performance, growth in the volume of Australia's exports has recently shown some signs of recovery, led by an increase in resource exports, while growth in import volumes has slowed somewhat in the first half of 2005. At the same time, Australia has continued to benefit from favourable movements in external prices, and the terms of trade are estimated to have increased by a further 5½ per cent in the June quarter. As a result, Australia's trade deficit is likely to have narrowed considerably in the June quarter to around 2¼ per cent of GDP which, if confirmed, would be the smallest deficit recorded for nearly three years (Graph 36). Assuming the net income deficit has remained unchanged as a share of GDP during the June quarter, this would imply a decline in the current account deficit to around 6¼ per cent of GDP, from more than 7 per cent in the March quarter. ", " Export earnings increased by 14 per cent over the year to the June quarter, due to strong growth in prices and a modest recovery in volumes. The pick-up in volumes has been concentrated in resource exports, as several mining-related projects have come on-line, although manufactured exports also posted solid growth supported by robust global demand (Graph 37). In contrast, rural and services exports have both fallen over the year. ", " Rural export earnings declined by 13 per cent over the year to the June quarter, with a fall in cereals exports more than offsetting strength in meat export earnings. Nonetheless, there are signs that rural exports are beginning to stabilise: the value of rural exports increased by around 5½ per cent in the June quarter, and recent rainfall in southern and eastern Australia has improved the outlook for rural production. Further, the discovery of another case of BSE in the US may increase demand for Australian beef. ", " Resource export earnings increased by 40 per cent over the year to mid 2005, reflecting growth in commodity prices, especially for iron ore and coal. Earnings have also been supported by expansions of capacity in the production of commodities such as iron ore, LNG and other petroleum products. These trends were particularly evident in the June quarter, with the value of resource exports increasing by 25 per cent (further discussed in the commodity prices section below). As noted in the February <em>Statement</em>, the outlook for resource export volumes is favourable: external demand remains firm; there are a large number of new projects due to commence production; and some easing of transport infrastructure constraints appears to be underway. ", " The value of manufactured exports increased by 7½ per cent over the year to mid 2005. Growth was particularly strong in the June quarter, but this appears to reflect some special factors. After increasing in the March quarter, the volume of services exports appears to have fallen back in the June quarter. Looking through the volatility, services exports are broadly unchanged from their level of 2001. Recent weakness in travel services exports has reflected a decrease in the average expenditure of visitors over the past year, which has more than offset an increase in the number of visitor arrivals. Nonetheless, the outlook for tourism-related services exports appears positive, with trading partner growth expected to remain firm. ", " The growth in import volumes has slowed moderately this year, reflecting the slowing in the growth of domestic spending. Import volumes grew by 10 per cent over the year to the March quarter, with contributions from all major goods categories as well as services (Graph 38). More recently, the value of imports increased by 4 per cent in the June quarter, although this growth appears to have been concentrated in the volatile fuels &amp; lubricants and civilian aircraft components. Imports of consumption goods have levelled out following the stimulus last quarter when tariffs on imports of passenger motor vehicles and textiles, clothing &amp; footwear were reduced. ", " The net income deficit (NID) widened slightly in the March quarter, to reach $8.4 billion or 3.9 per cent of <span class=\"no-wrap\">GDP (Graph 39)</span>. Over the year, the NID increased by $2.6 billion (1 per cent of GDP), predominantly reflecting higher payments to foreign holders of both Australian debt and equity. The rise in payments on Australia's foreign debt liabilities over the year was broadly in line with increases in the stock of debt, while higher payments on foreign equity holdings reflected strong earnings growth in the sectors where foreign ownership is more prevalent, particularly the mining sector. Australia's stock of net foreign liabilities increased by 14 per cent over the year to the March quarter, to reach 65 per cent of GDP, mainly due to increases in net foreign debt liabilities. ", " Buoyant global demand conditions and large increases in contract prices for Australia's iron ore and coal exports have pushed the RBA index of commodity prices (ICP) to its highest level in the 23 year history of the index. In SDR terms, the ICP is estimated to have increased by 4 per cent over the three months to July and by 2<span class=\"no-wrap\">4 per cent</span> relative to its level a year earlier (Graph 40 and Table 7). In Australian dollar terms, commodity prices increased by 2½ per cent over the three months to July, to be 16 per cent higher over the year. ", " As noted in the May <em>Statement</em>, contracts for exports of iron ore and coking coal were recently negotiated with US dollar price increases of around 70 per cent and 120 per cent respectively, effective from the start of April. Over the three months to June, preliminary data suggest iron ore and coking coal prices increased by 57 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">54 per cent</span> in US dollar terms, and these prices could rise further in the coming months. In contrast, the price increase for steaming coal exports has been more modest, following large gains last year. ", " The rural price index increased by 2 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to July, with wheat prices increasing over the period (Graph 41). Beef export prices fell slightly over the three months to July, although prices have picked up recently following the discovery of a second case of BSE in the US. ", " Base metals prices fell by 1 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to July, but remain at high levels. Nickel prices declined as demand for stainless steel fell back, while aluminium prices have been weighed down by strength in Chinese aluminium production. However, copper prices strengthened over the three months to July, reaching a record high in July as copper inventories held at the warehouses of the London Metal Exchange fell to thirty-year lows and strikes at various copper production facilities added to uncertainty in the market. ", " The terms of trade increased by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter and are estimated to have increased by around 5½ per cent in the June quarter, following the increases in iron ore and coal prices (Graph 42). This brings the total increase in the terms of trade over the past three years to around 25 per cent and their level to the highest point since 1974. ", " Oil prices increased over the three months to July, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price setting a daily record above US$61 per barrel in early August (Graph 43). The increase appeared to reflect a continuation of the shortage of excess production capacity that has weighed on the oil market for the last year. Additional recent factors include the potential for supply reductions arising from hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, political unrest in Nigeria and a threatened strike in Norway, as well as concerns over refining capacity constraints. The price rise occurred despite an increase in OPEC production quotas of ½ million barrels per day and higher levels of crude oil inventories in the US. ", " Short-term market rates have been fairly steady over the past few months at levels just above the cash rate target of 5½ per cent (Graph 44). This suggests there has been little change in expectations of the cash rate since the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>, with markets continuing to expect that monetary policy will be unchanged for the next six months or so. ", " Long-term bond yields are also little changed in net terms since the previous <em>Statement</em>, at around 5.3 per cent. They did, however, show some variation during the period, largely in response to developments in overseas markets. Yields on 10-year government bonds rose a little in early May, before falling by around 40 basis points to 5.0 per cent by mid June. The subsequent rise in yields has been a little less than in the US, causing the spread between Australian and US 10-year bond yields to narrow to around 100 basis points. ", " Yields on inflation-linked bonds, at 2.6 per cent, are also unchanged in net terms since early May after falling to 2.5 per cent by mid June, their lowest recorded level (Graph 45). In contrast, indexed bond yields in the US rose over the same period. ", " With nominal yields on government bonds around 20 basis points below the cash rate, the domestic yield curve remains inverted. An inverted yield curve normally arises when a monetary policy tightening cycle is thought to be around its peak. While the yield curve could be signalling such market expectations on this occasion, it may also be that local bond yields have been unduly influenced by the factors that have resulted in unusually low bond yields globally. As a consequence, it remains difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the expected stance of monetary policy from the shape of the yield curve at this time. ", " There has been little net change in the market's perceptions of corporate credit risk during the past three months. Both spreads between corporate bond yields and swap rates, and the premia on credit default swaps, remain low by historical standards (Graph 46). As with the low level of bond yields, there is a good deal of debate in global markets about whether the current levels of corporate spreads adequately reflect credit risks. Default rates on bonds have recently been low and the outlook for the corporate sector remains favourable. On the other hand, there is also evidence that spreads may have been driven down by the continued search for yield in the global, low interest rate environment. ", " This compression of spreads has also been evident in the yields on highly-rated residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). From 2003 to mid 2005 the spreads at which AAA-rated tranches of RMBS were issued recorded a net fall of around 15 basis points (Graph 47). Spreads on AAA-rated corporate bonds have also declined over this period. ", " Intermediaries' variable indicator lending rates have remained broadly unchanged since the last <em>Statement</em>, consistent with there having been no change in the cash rate. There have, however, been some recent increases in the discounts available on some large mortgages. Interest rates on fixed-rate housing loans fell slightly, reflecting earlier reductions in the cost of funding fixed-rate loans (Graph 48 and Table 8). ", " Demand by borrowers for fixed-rate housing loans peaked in March – probably reflecting the increase in the cash rate in that month – and has since eased, presumably as borrowers have wound back their expectations of further monetary policy tightening. In May, the latest month for which data are available, around 11 per cent of new owner-occupier housing loans were taken out at fixed rates, still a little above the average for the past five years. ", " Small business fixed rates, which tend to be adjusted more often than housing fixed rates, fell by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">20 basis points</span> between April and June, but have since retraced a little, to be 10 basis points below their level as at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> (Graph 49). Data on the composition of banks' outstanding business loans by type of interest rate indicate a further decline in the use of fixed-rate loans in the March quarter. Among loans with outstanding balances less than $500,000, 30 per cent were at fixed rates as at the end of March, down from around 45 per cent five years earlier, while for larger loans the fixed-rate share was below 15 per cent. ", " At the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>, the Australian share market had fallen to its lowest level for the year so far – around 3 per cent lower than at end December 2004. Since then, the market has more than retraced these falls, with the ASX 200 increasing by 10 per cent to reach record highs in late July. Over this period, the Australian market has performed a little more strongly than global equity markets (Graph 50). ", " Resources companies have performed strongly over the past few months, with their share price gains driven by the strength in commodity prices and the positive outlook for global economic growth. Although the consumer discretionary sector fell sharply in the first part of the year, in response to evidence of slowing retail sales and a large number of profit warnings, it has kept pace with the market as a whole since early May (Graph 51). ", " A higher-than-usual number of profit warnings have also been made by companies outside the consumer discretionary sector – mainly materials, real estate, and industrials (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a>). However, these companies represent only a small proportion of the market and analysts' aggregate earnings expectations have been little changed in recent months (Graph 52). Ahead of the upcoming reporting season, average earnings per share for companies in the ASX 200 is expected to have increased by around 20 per cent in 2004/05, with 11 per cent growth expected in 2005/06. ", " Actual earnings reported in the year to date have continued at high levels and, despite equity prices having moved noticeably higher in recent months, the price-earnings (P/E) ratio has increased only slightly. At <span class=\"no-wrap\">around 16½</span>, the ratio is a little above its long-term average. The recent price increases have also seen the dividend yield fall slightly to 3.5 per cent compared with 3.7 per cent in April (Graph 53). ", " Margin lending for the purchase of shares and managed funds rose by 7 per cent in the June quarter, to <span class=\"no-wrap\">$18 billion (Graph 54)</span>. Growth over the year, at 30 per cent, was the fastest since early 2002, and contributed around one-quarter of the 14 per cent growth in total personal credit over this period. The growth in margin debt over the year was due to a rise in the number of borrowers and an increase in the average size of outstanding loans, which rose by around 18 per cent, to $118,000. As is typical in the June quarter, a higher proportion, <span class=\"no-wrap\">60 per cent</span>, of new loans was taken out at fixed rates with interest pre-paid, thereby enabling investors to bring forward tax deductions. ", " Despite the recent strong growth, indicators of the riskiness of investors' margin loan positions, such as average leverage and the percentage of credit limits used, remain low. Reflecting this and general strength in the share market, the average frequency of margin calls was also low. ", " Australian non-government entities issued a record $50 billion of bonds in the June quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 9</span> and <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 55)</span>. The strength in issuance was broad-based; gross issuance in both the domestic and offshore markets was 70 per cent higher than the respective post-2001 quarterly averages, with non-financial corporates, financial institutions and asset-backed vehicles all recording above-average issuance. ", " Around four-fifths of non-financial corporates' issuance was into offshore markets, mostly the US private placement market. The funds appear to have been mainly used to refinance existing bank debt and maturing corporate bonds. A larger-than-usual proportion of issuance by asset-backed vehicles was into the domestic market (though foreign interest in these securities remained strong). In contrast, financial institutions continued to heavily favour offshore markets when issuing bonds in their own name. ", " There have been few announcements of new hybrid securities since the previous <em>Statement</em>. Contributing to this is the fact that many banks are close to their Tier 1 limits for hybrid capital. Issuance by non-financial corporates was quite strong in the early part of the year. ", " Net equity raisings in the June quarter were around their post-2001 quarterly average (Graph 56). IPO activity was strong, with 49 companies raising a total of $2.5 billion. Companies in the financials sector – mostly listed investment funds and property trusts – accounted for 70 per cent of the value of IPO capital raised. Other equity raisings were a little below average and there was also a somewhat higher-than-usual amount of buybacks in the quarter. Non-financial corporates accounted for almost all of the buybacks, led by large off-market buybacks by Rio Tinto and Coles Myer. ", " Financial conditions are at present reasonably accommodative. The overnight cash rate remains close to its average level of the past decade in both real and nominal terms, and advertised indicator interest rates for housing and business lending are also close to average levels. The cash rate is at present slightly above longer-term bond yields, which is often considered to be a sign that the market views current policy settings as relatively tight. However, as has been the case for some time now, Australian bond yields are to a large extent being influenced by unusually low US bond yields, which themselves are at odds with rising short-term interest rates and data suggesting solid growth in the US economy. ", " Policy may in fact be more accommodative than would be suggested by some of these standard benchmarks. Although indicator interest rates on business lending are near historical average levels, broader measures of the actual cost of borrowing, which incorporate margins and discounts, remain low. Similarly, the increased tendency for lenders to offer discounts means that actual interest rates paid on new housing loans are lower than the cash rate suggests (Graph 57). Although up-to-date figures on the extent of home-loan rate discounting are not available, there is evidence suggesting that the size and availability of these discounts have increased of late. The recent upswing in refinancing activity also implies that a greater proportion of all mortgage borrowers are taking advantage of these discount offers. ", " Credit continues to grow faster than nominal income, suggesting that interest rates are not overly constraining demand for credit. Total credit increased at an annualised rate of 11½ per cent over the six months to June <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 10</span>, <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 58)</span>. The annualised growth of business credit was 12½ per cent over the same period, continuing the upward trend that has been evident over the past few years. Coupled with the persistent strength in capital market raisings, this suggests that businesses' access to external finance remains unimpeded. In contrast, the six-month-ended annualised rate of household credit growth continued its downward trend that began in late 2003, reaching 10¾ per cent in June. The downward trend in household credit growth largely reflects developments in housing credit. Growth in the smaller non-housing personal component has also moderated from its recent peak in January 2005, to an annualised rate of 10½ per cent over the six months to June. This is consistent with the decline in personal loan approvals, and mainly reflects falls in fixed-term lending, though the revolving component has also contributed. ", " The Australian dollar is around 13 per cent above its post-float average, measured in quarterly average real <span class=\"no-wrap\">trade-weighted</span> terms. While the relatively high real exchange rate is likely to be constraining activity for some exporting and import-competing firms, the current level of the exchange rate is lower than might have been suggested by its past relationship with the terms of trade (Graph 59). ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter, to be 2.5 per cent higher over <span class=\"no-wrap\">the year (Graph 60, Table 11)</span>. Petrol prices made the most significant contribution to the overall increase in both quarterly and year-ended terms; they increased by over 7 per cent in the quarter and by 10½ per cent over the year, reflecting movements in world oil prices. Other significant contributions to CPI inflation in the June quarter were made by hospital and medical services prices, largely due to the increase in health insurance premiums, and house purchase costs. The cost of domestic holiday travel and accommodation declined in the quarter, in part reflecting unusually high prices in the March quarter associated with the early timing of Easter; fruit prices also fell significantly. ", " The Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation was also around 2½ per cent over the year to the June quarter, based on a range of indicators including statistical measures of inflation calculated from the seasonally adjusted price distribution (for more detail, see ‘<a href=\"#box-d\">Box D: Measures of Underlying Inflation</a>’ and Table 11). ", " The gap between tradables and non-tradables price inflation has continued to narrow (Graph 61). Tradables prices increased by 1.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter, although they were broadly flat excluding food and petrol prices. The dampening impact on tradables prices of the appreciation of the exchange rate over 2002 and 2003 appears to have largely passed. Non-tradables price inflation remained firm at <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.5 per cent</span> over the year, but its pace has continued to ease. This partly reflects developments in house purchase costs, which have a large weight in the index. While house purchase costs increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">5 per cent</span> over the year, the pace of growth has moderated since the peak of over 6 per cent in late 2003, in line with developments in dwelling construction activity. ", " Producer price data indicate that price increases in the first half of 2005 were more moderate than those seen in the second half of 2004, particularly at the final stage of production (Graph 62, Table 12). The significant increase in world oil prices in the June quarter dominated the movements in producer prices in that quarter, accounting for roughly half of the quarterly price increase at each stage of production. ", " Prices at the final stage of production increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, to be 3.4 per cent higher over the year. Abstracting from the direct effects of oil, the prices of domestically produced final goods increased by 0.6 per cent in the quarter, primarily due to a 1.1 per cent increase in building construction prices. Although still large, the increase in construction prices was the smallest seen for several years, suggesting that price pressures in the construction industry are moderating. The prices of final imported goods fell marginally in the June quarter, due to falls in the prices of capital goods such as electronic equipment and motor vehicles &amp; parts. ", " Most measures of aggregate wage growth showed some pick-up in wage pressures in the March quarter, and there was tentative evidence that these pressures were more broadly based than in previous quarters. These outcomes are consistent with the strong labour market developments in 2004 and the first half of 2005, and with information obtained through the Bank's liaison program. ", " The wage price index (WPI) grew by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter, to be 3.9 per cent higher over the year <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 63)</span>. The average annualised wage increase (AAWI) for federal enterprise bargaining agreements certified in the March quarter was 4.3 per cent, while the AAWI for federal agreements current in the quarter was unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Other official labour cost data based on wage bills, such as average weekly ordinary-time earnings and average earnings from the national accounts, also showed that wage growth strengthened in the March quarter. In contrast, the NAB quarterly business survey reported that year-ended growth in actual labour costs was steady in the June quarter. ", " Official wage statistics and liaison contacts suggest that recent wage pressures have been concentrated in certain sectors. The WPI indicated that firm wage growth continued in education and in industries facing strong demand, such as construction and mining, and feedback from the Bank's liaison program shows large wage pressures in non-residential construction and business services. Furthermore, there was also some evidence that these pressures have broadened to other sectors, with the WPI recording a pick-up in wage growth in a number of other industries. ", " Business surveys continue to suggest that firms have been experiencing difficulty finding suitable labour, though this situation has eased a little recently (Graph 64). Liaison contacts report that forms of non-wage remuneration, such as bonus payments, larger employer superannuation contributions, earlier promotions and more flexible working arrangements, have been increasingly used to attract and retain staff in recent months. Staff training costs are also reported to have increased. ", " Unit labour costs, which measure total labour costs per unit of output, grew by 1.6 per cent in the March quarter to be 4.1 per cent higher over the year, which is above the average pace of growth of the past five years. The growth in unit labour costs mostly reflects a reported slowing in labour productivity, as output growth eased at the same time as employment growth was strong. Looking ahead, the effects of the increased unit labour costs on CPI inflation will depend on whether firms absorb these costs or pass them on to consumers. ", " Business surveys generally suggest near-term inflationary pressures are contained. In the ACCI-Westpac June quarter survey, the net balance of manufacturing firms expecting to raise prices over the coming months remained at a low level. The NAB survey reported that, while inflation in final prices across all industries is expected to increase in the September quarter, retail price inflation is expected to remain steady. ", " Private-sector expectations for year-ended CPI inflation over the next two years are contained in a relatively narrow range between 2½ and 3 per cent. Both market economists and union officials, surveyed after the release of the June quarter CPI, expect inflation to pick up over the year to June 2006; the median expectation of both groups is 2¾ per cent (Table 13). Thereafter, the median expectation of market economists is for CPI inflation to ease back to 2½ per cent over the year to June 2007. The median expectation for union officials is for year-ended inflation to rise to 3 per cent by the end of 2006 and to then stabilise around this level. Consumers' expectations of inflation over the year ahead, as reported in the Melbourne Institute survey, stand at <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.7 per cent</span>. While slightly higher than its average over the past five years, this series has shown little correlation with either current or future inflation in recent years. Finally, financial market participants' medium-term inflation expectations, calculated as the difference between nominal and indexed bond yields, have remained broadly steady since the last <em>Statement</em>, averaging <span class=\"no-wrap\">2.6 per cent</span> over the past three months. ", " CPI inflation was 2.5 per cent over the year to the June quarter and, based on a range of indicators, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation was running at a similar rate. Quarterly inflation outcomes have been relatively stable recently, with a modest slowing in inflation of non-tradables roughly offset by the gradual pick-up in tradables inflation. Looking forward, it is likely that the dampening effect of the 2002 and 2003 exchange rate appreciation on tradables inflation has mostly passed, and recent wage outcomes have been firm. At the same time, the slowing in the pace of domestic demand growth should contain overall price pressures. These developments suggest that underlying inflation is evolving as foreshadowed in the May <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, with underlying inflation still expected to increase gradually, reaching 3 per cent in the second half of 2006. However, based on the easing of demand growth apparent so far this year, this is likely to be the peak, with underlying inflation not expected to increase beyond 3 per cent in 2007. In the near term, headline CPI inflation is likely to be above underlying inflation reflecting the pass-through of the current strength in oil prices, which are assumed to remain broadly unchanged over the forecast horizon. ", " The risks to the projection of underlying inflation appear to be balanced. On the one hand, if the current strength of the labour market were to persist, there is an upside risk that labour cost growth could pick up faster than is currently assumed. In addition, oil prices have increased significantly recently and are expected to remain at high levels, which could lead to second-round price effects and an upward adjustment in inflation expectations. On the other hand, the slower pace of domestic demand compared with last year's rate has increased the likelihood that further upstream price pressures, should they eventuate, will be absorbed into profit margins rather than be passed on to final consumer prices. ", " Developments in the global information, technology &amp; communication (ITC) goods sector are an important driver of activity, particularly in east Asia, which has become the global manufacturing base for ITC products. Demand for ITC goods surged during 2003 and early 2004, but has eased noticeably since then. The outlook for the sector has nonetheless improved in the past few months, and activity is expected to rebound sometime in the second half of this year. ", " The latest cyclical upturn in the ITC sector reached its peak around mid 2004, when growth in world semiconductor sales, a commonly used indicator of the current state of the ITC cycle, reached its highest rate since late 2000. The upswing was consistent with the pick-up in world economic activity, which has become increasingly correlated with the ITC cycle since the late 1990s (Graph A1). This increased correlation highlights the growing importance of ITC goods to both the business and household sectors. ", " Semiconductor sales have been flat since mid 2004, such that the year-ended growth rate slowed from about 40 per cent to 1 per cent in June 2005. Most industry analysts expect that the slowdown will be short-lived, and milder than the 2001 downturn, with a recovery expected sometime in the second half of this year. This expectation partly reflects that inventories have not been built up to the extent seen in 2000–2001, and also that demand has been more balanced between households and businesses. More than half the semiconductors sold in 2004 were for consumer goods. ", " The positive outlook is also based on expectations that continued strong world growth will underpin demand, especially demand from the US where investment in ITC goods has been rising rapidly. In line with this, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Tech Pulse Index, which is a broad measure of the health of the US ITC industry, is growing at a fast pace. The US semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio, a closely watched indicator of future semiconductor production, has also risen sharply in recent months, although it is still below 1, implying that orders are falling short of current shipments (Graph A2). Investors also seem to have become more optimistic about the prospects for the ITC industry, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of share prices and the broader NASDAQ Composite Index both at their highest levels in over a year. ", " Economic growth in east Asia is particularly sensitive to developments in the global ITC sector, because of the high share of ITC goods in its exports. ITC goods account for one-third of total merchandise exports from the region as a whole, and more than half of the exports from Malaysia and the Philippines. The ITC shares of China's and Korea's exports have risen significantly over the past five years to be more than <span class=\"no-wrap\">35 per cent</span> in 2004; China is now the largest ITC exporter in the region. The softening in ITC demand has accordingly contributed noticeably to slower economic growth in the region since mid 2004, and production of ITC goods has remained subdued in recent months. While considerable progress has been made in reducing inventories, the adjustment may still have further to run. However, growth is expected to pick up as companies work off excess inventories, and there are already signs of recovery in the rebound in growth of ITC exports since late 2004 (Graph A3). ", " It is now around 1½ years since the sharp cooling in the boom in Australian house prices. This box outlines some new data that have been compiled to provide a better measure of median house prices. It then surveys price developments since the market peak, both nationwide and in the major capitals, and their impact on the broader economy. ", " Analysis of short-term developments in Australian house prices in recent years has been hampered by two major problems.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> The first has been <em>data timeliness</em>. From an economic standpoint, it is desirable for house price data to be based on the period in which the price was determined (i.e. at contract exchange) rather than when the transaction was subsequently settled. In the absence of a reporting requirement at the time of sale, it has been necessary to rely on data collected by state governments after settlement has <span class=\"no-wrap\">occurred.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup></span> This is usually several months after the transaction was agreed to, with information becoming available only very gradually. Furthermore, it has become apparent that the early samples are often quite unrepresentative and could provide a biased estimate of price developments in the eventual full sample of sales. ", " The second problem is the more general one of <em>compositional change</em>. Most of the house price series used in Australia are based on city-wide median prices.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 3\">[3]</a></sup> However, measures of median (or mean) prices are dependent on the sample of transactions in the period in question. There is evidence of substantial shifts in sample composition in some cities, with some quarters having a high proportion of sales in higher-priced suburbs and other quarters having more sales in lower-priced suburbs. For example, in Sydney, nearly three-quarters of the variation in quarterly median prices can be attributed to compositional shifts between higher and lower-priced suburbs, rather than reflecting pure price changes. ", " To overcome these problems, the Bank commissioned Australian Property Monitors (APM) to put together some new data on median house prices in major capitals stratified by market segment. To counter the problem of limited availability of data in the months immediately after the close of the most recent quarter, the data from state governments have been augmented with APM's own collection of data on auction and private treaty sales. This has the effect of significantly increasing the sample size for the most recent quarter: for the June quarter 2005, the sample size is more than doubled for Melbourne where the problem of slow reporting is most pronounced. ", " To address the more general problem of compositional change, sales in each quarter in each of the capital cities were sorted into ten different groups (five for Canberra) based on the longer-term median sales price for the suburb in which the property was located. Stratifying sales into groups in this way ensures that each group consists of a much more homogenous set of houses than the city-wide sample of all sales. Median prices in each of these individual groups can then be combined to provide an estimate of price developments in the overall market that is far less affected by compositional change than a conventional city-wide median measure. ", " The combination of the use of data on additional sales, and the stratification of all sales into groups, results in a measure of median house prices for each city that is substantially less volatile than a conventional median and subject to much less seasonality (Graph B1). It is also considerably less subject to revision, even when initial estimates are made soon after the end of a quarter. ", " The resulting new median price series confirm that there has been a marked cooling in nationwide house price growth over the past 18 months (Table B1 and Graph B2). In the 18 months prior to the December quarter of 2003, average nationwide prices rose by nearly 30 per cent, but they have been flat in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 months</span> since then. ", " This pattern of rapidly rising prices followed by a noticeable slowdown in house price growth is evident, albeit to varying degrees, in each of the capitals. Indeed, it is also evident in every group of suburbs in every capital. Average city-wide prices have fallen or remained unchanged in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra over the past 18 months. There has been only modest growth in Brisbane over this period, which is a very sharp slowdown from the prior period when prices rose by around 60 per cent. Growth in Adelaide and Perth has also slowed, but in contrast to the other capitals, prices continued to rise at a solid rate over the most recent 18 months, especially in Perth which has clearly benefited from the strength of the resources sector. ", " Composition-adjusted measures of apartment prices in Sydney and Melbourne, which together account for around 70 per cent of the total capital-city apartment stock, have followed a broadly similar pattern to house prices. Apartment prices rose solidly in the 18 months to the December quarter 2003, but have fallen over the past 18 months. ", " The divergent experience in house prices over the past 18 months appears to be partly related to the extent and timing of the prior build-up in prices. The boom started first in Sydney and Melbourne, with these capitals showing significant growth from 1996. Cumulative growth in house prices from late 1995 to late 2003 was strongest in these two capitals and in Canberra, with prices increasing by around 12 to <span class=\"no-wrap\">13 per cent</span> per year on average in this period. These are also the three cities where house prices have been weakest since late 2003. By contrast, the boom in Perth started later and the cumulative price gain until late 2003 was noticeably less than in other capitals, with prices rising by 9 per cent per year on average over this period. So it may not be surprising that price growth has been strongest in Perth in the subsequent period. ", " Although it is difficult to reach conclusive judgements on the extent of possible overvaluations in house prices, two measures that are sometimes used to shed light on this issue are the ratios of house prices to labour incomes and to rents. In each case, these ratios suggest that housing valuations may have been most stretched in late 2003 in Sydney and Melbourne. For example, the ratio of capital city house prices to (state-wide) annual earnings had risen sharply in these two cities, to levels well above those in the other capitals (Graph B3).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"r4\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 4\">[4]</a></sup> Similarly, gross rental yields had also fallen to particularly low levels in <span class=\"no-wrap\">these cities (Graph B4)</span>. Hence the price weakness in the two largest cities over the past 18 months appears to partly reflect an unwinding of earlier unsustainable movements in prices. ", " Given the importance of housing in the macroeconomy, it is not surprising that the sharp slowing in the growth of house prices has been associated with a slowing in the growth of domestic demand. The earlier long boom in house prices was accompanied by a sharp rise in residential building activity. However, this was reversed with the cooling of the price boom, with the number of nationwide private residential building approvals falling by 11 per cent between the December quarter 2003 and the June quarter 2005, despite picking up in the first half of 2005. House price developments appear to have also had broader effects on spending by households. Whereas nationwide real retail sales had risen by nearly 10 per cent in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">18 months</span> to the December quarter 2003, growth slowed to 4½ per cent over the period to June 2005. Although the state-level data for building approvals and retail trade data are fairly volatile, state developments do tend to be correlated with house price developments (Table B2). For example, activity in Western Australia has remained stronger than the nationwide average while activity in NSW and the ACT has been relatively weak, consistent with developments in house prices. ", " Of course, developments in house prices have not been the only cause of the different outcomes experienced by state economies over the recent period. Nor has the impact been completely from house prices to economic developments, as opposed to vice versa. However, the state-level data are consistent with developments in house prices having had major direct and indirect effects on the Australian economy and having contributed to the recent slowing in the growth of domestic demand. As the Bank has noted in other contexts, this slowing in demand is part of a consolidation of household balance sheets and was unavoidable given the sharp run-up in household borrowing that accompanied the rapid increase in house prices. The correction in the housing market appears so far to have proceeded reasonably smoothly, and the prospect of an excessive and unwelcome slowing in domestic demand has been reduced by the boost to national incomes coming from the favourable terms of trade. ", " As discussed in the May <em>Statement</em>,<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"r5\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> profits of listed companies have increased strongly in recent years. Profit growth was particularly strong in the first half of 2004/05, with listed companies' aggregate underlying profits being 33 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year. This compares with average annual growth in underlying profits of 11 per cent since 1997. ", " In the first six months of 2005, 130 listed companies issued warnings that profits in 2004/05 as a whole would most likely be less than previously expected. (There have also been a few warnings made since then.) This is around 8 per cent of all companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, a share which is quite high by recent historical standards (top panel of Graph C1). Part of the increase in the number of companies issuing warnings is probably a result of increased pressure to improve transparency and provide fairly explicit earnings forecasts to the general public. It is also perhaps an attempt by companies to rein in expectations of a continuation of the recent very strong pace of profit growth. Moreover, the companies that have issued profit warnings tend to have been small. As a result, they comprise around 7 per cent of total market capitalisation, which is not high by recent historical standards (bottom panel of Graph C1). ", " Of companies giving warnings, 59 per cent cited factors which could be considered company-specific (such as write-offs of capital expenditure, restructuring costs, staff redundancies, the loss of a major customer or contract to a competitor, and interruptions in production or distribution) (Table C1). The next most commonly cited reason was difficult trading conditions, in some cases driven by weaker residential construction activity. ", " Of companies issuing warnings for the 2004/05 financial year, almost two thirds by number (79 out of 130) and 40 per cent by market capitalisation expect negative earnings growth – that is, a lower level of earnings <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table C2)</span>. The remaining companies are expecting positive, but lower-than-initially forecast, growth in earnings in 2004/05. Many of these will probably still report strong earnings growth, with aggregate earnings for these companies expected to be almost 23 per cent higher than in 2003/04, virtually the same as the growth rate for the broader market. This suggests many of the profit warnings were merely a scaling back of extremely strong expectations. ", " As noted above, the profit downgrades were concentrated amongst companies that tended to be a bit smaller than average. As well, some companies have indicated that profits will be stronger than previously expected. Reflecting this, forecasts for growth in aggregate earnings in 2004/05 have been revised down only slightly in the last couple of months, to around 22 per cent for companies in the ASX 200. Growth in 2005/06 is expected to be around 15 per cent. ", " Australia's inflation target is expressed in terms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). With inflation low and relatively stable, CPI inflation has been a reasonable guide to trend inflationary pressures in recent years. However, the CPI is still subject to a degree of short-term volatility, which sometimes makes it difficult to interpret quarterly movements in measured inflation. Accordingly, the Bank continues to incorporate a selection of underlying inflation measures, which are less affected by short-term volatility, into its analysis of the economy. These include exclusion-based measures (such as the CPI excluding volatile items) and statistical measures (such as the trimmed mean and weighted median).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"r6\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> Recent research has shown that, while existing statistical measures perform satisfactorily as measures of underlying inflation, they can be enhanced, at the margin, by technical modifications to better account for seasonality, as outlined in <span class=\"no-wrap\">Roberts (2005)</span>. This Box introduces four underlying inflation measures that have been modified along these lines, and explains how they augment the existing set of underlying inflation measures published by the Bank. ", " The trimmed mean and weighted median measures published by the Bank have been calculated each quarter using disaggregated quarterly price changes and expenditure weights drawn from the CPI. Year-ended rates have then been calculated by compounding the quarterly movements. There are a couple of alternatives to this approach that provide slightly different estimates of underlying inflation when CPI components display seasonality in the timing of their price changes. One is to calculate the quarterly trimmed mean and weighted median inflation rates using seasonally adjusted quarterly price changes; another is to calculate year-ended underlying rates directly using year-ended price changes. ", " To understand the issues raised by seasonality at the CPI component level, it is helpful to consider the example of the trimmed mean. The trimmed mean is calculated as the weighted mean of the central <span class=\"no-wrap\">70 per cent</span> of the distribution of quarterly price changes when the latter are arranged in order of magnitude. Goods and services in the CPI that display seasonally large increases once a year often fall into the top 15 per cent of the distribution in the quarters when these large price changes occur, and are therefore removed in those quarters. However, it is much less likely that they would fall into the lower <span class=\"no-wrap\">15 per cent</span> of the distribution in the quarters when they tend to have only small price changes. The tendency to trim high outcomes but not low ones will result, on average, in a slightly lower inflation rate for statistical measures such as the trimmed mean than for the published CPI. ", " Seasonally adjusting prices at the disaggregated component level can eliminate bias from such effects by smoothing seasonal increases over the course of a year. Calculating the trimmed mean directly on an annual basis achieves a similar effect, because large seasonal quarterly movements in particular components tend to wash out of year-ended price changes. Both approaches reduce the chance that a strong seasonal price movement will regularly be trimmed from the distribution of price changes. For example, the pharmaceuticals component is one of the items most frequently removed by the trimmed mean based on unadjusted quarterly price changes, owing to a large positive movement once each year resulting from the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. But when prices are seasonally adjusted, or annual price changes are used, this component is removed far less frequently. ", " Graph D1 shows the trimmed mean and weighted median based on unadjusted quarterly price changes, seasonally adjusted quarterly price changes and year-ended price changes. It is apparent that the different measures are highly correlated, but the measures based on seasonally adjusted quarterly price changes and year-ended price changes tend to be slightly higher than the unadjusted measures. Over time, on average, the unadjusted measures record slightly lower inflation than the CPI. By comparison, there is no evidence that growth in the four alternative underlying inflation measures is substantially different on average from CPI inflation. ", " All of the statistical underlying inflation measures considered in this Box have been found in recent research to perform satisfactorily, on various criteria, as measures of underlying inflation. The fact that the measures based on seasonally adjusted or annual price changes have been unbiased with respect to CPI inflation suggests that they may be conceptually superior as measures of underlying inflation. In practice, however, the calculation of these types of measures is complicated by the need to seasonally adjust data, which involves potential revisions to the series as estimates of seasonality are updated. Furthermore, there is the added complication of periodic compositional change, following the five-yearly revisions to the CPI basket. Accordingly, it is likely that both the traditional and the new measures will be useful in making ongoing assessments of inflationary pressures.

Most regions of the world are experiencing good economic growth this year, with the United States and China in particular performing strongly. There has been a notable improvement in conditions in Japan, where spending by businesses and consumers has strengthened and there has been good progress in winding back the balance sheet excesses that had hampered growth in the past. Elsewhere, solid growth is being recorded in the east Asian region and in the emerging economies of Eastern Europe and Latin America, with the euro area the only significant weak spot at present. Overall the world economy is likely to record a further year of above-average growth in 2005, and most observers expect this to continue next year. ", " A lot of attention over the past couple of years has focused on the upward trend in oil prices and its effects on the global economy. While periodic disruptions to supply have at times contributed to this trend, the main cause has been the strength of world demand. In these circumstances, higher oil prices do not appear to have had a significant contractionary effect on the world economy, and observers have not generally been scaling back their expectations of future world growth during the period when oil prices have been rising. The main macroeconomic effects to date can be seen in higher headline inflation figures around the world, most notably in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">United States</span>. As yet, there has been little evidence of any significant second-round inflationary effects, and at this stage core inflation rates in most advanced countries remain contained. ", " The increase in world oil prices has occurred as part of a more general rise in global commodity prices over recent years. World prices of coal, iron ore and a range of other resources have risen sharply as a result of strong growth in global demand, with the rapidly expanding Chinese economy playing an important part. These trends are to Australia's advantage, providing a substantial boost to the country's terms of trade and hence having an expansionary influence on domestic incomes and spending. Indeed, over the past three years, the Australian economy has experienced its largest cumulative increase in the terms of trade since the early 1970s. ", " These favourable international conditions are helping to support growth of the economy at a time when domestic factors have been exerting a modest dampening effect on household spending. The net result is that growth of the economy overall has remained quite solid, while there has been a significant shift in the composition of demand and output. Australian households for a while now have been in a process of adjustment after a period of unsustainably rapid growth in their borrowing and spending, and the more cautious approach they are now showing has been reflected in a reduction in the growth of consumer spending and debt. Nevertheless, growth in household incomes and spending continues to be supported by strong growth in employment and real wages, and by recent tax cuts. Another factor that has been dampening household spending recently has been the downturn in the housing construction cycle, though this has been quite mild in comparison with previous cycles. ", " In contrast to the household sector, business investment spending has been expanding rapidly. One important factor contributing to this has been the high level of commodity prices, which has stimulated investment in the mining sector and in resource-related manufacturing and infrastructure projects. Nonetheless, the growth in investment has been quite broadly based, with forward indicators of investment intentions pointing to further solid growth. This is not surprising in an environment where businesses, with the exception of trade-exposed manufacturers, are generally experiencing good trading conditions, high levels of capacity utilisation and strong profitability, a situation which has also been reflected in a strong share market. ", " Favourable external conditions and high commodity prices have also contributed to a narrowing of Australia's trade and current account deficits this year. Although much of the improvement has been a direct result of higher export prices, there has also been some pickup in export volumes, while the growth in import volumes has eased a little in response to the slower trend in domestic demand. The farm sector has seen some improvement in conditions in recent months, so that farm output this year now appears likely to be around its average of recent years, compared with the well-below-average outcomes that had seemed likely earlier in the year. ", " Drawing these trends together, the economy over the past year or so has been experiencing a welcome change in the composition of growth, after a period in which the expansion had been mainly driven by growth in household spending. Over the same period, growth in demand overall has shifted to a more sustainable pace after the rapid growth seen previously. Economic indicators over recent months have confirmed that these trends are continuing, while suggesting that the chance of a more pronounced slowing has lessened. Current indications are that the economy is still operating at a relatively high level of capacity utilisation and that labour market conditions remain tight, with many businesses continuing to report considerable difficulty in attracting suitable labour. ", " Consumer price inflation picked up in the September quarter, with the CPI increasing by 0.9 per cent in the quarter and by 3 per cent over the past year, the largest annual increase since March 2003. The CPI increase was heavily affected by rising petrol prices, and underlying measures of consumer price inflation constructed by the Bank remained around 2½ per cent over the year. These results were broadly in line with the outlook presented in the previous <em>Statement</em>. ", " The fact that the headline CPI figure has moved to the top of the range that the Bank seeks to achieve on average does not of itself call for a monetary policy response, but needs to be placed in the context of the medium-term monetary policy framework. While Australia's inflation target is specified in terms of the overall CPI rather than underlying measures, the policy framework allows flexibility to look through volatility caused by temporary shocks to particular prices. Hence the focus of monetary policy is on whether, looking beyond any such temporary influences, inflation appears likely to be contained to an acceptable level in the medium term. In making this assessment, underlying inflation measures can serve as a useful summary indicator of current trends. ", " At present the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation is likely to increase gradually over the coming year, reflecting several forces. The effects of the earlier period of exchange rate appreciation in restraining import prices appear to have largely passed through, and prices of tradable goods in the CPI have begun to drift up. Tight labour market conditions are contributing to a gradual pick-up in wage growth, and business costs are also being pushed up by higher prices of fuel and other commodities. Producer prices data for the September quarter indicate that input costs have continued to grow quite quickly, though they are no longer accelerating as they were in the second half of last year. However, given the shift in the growth of demand to a more sustainable pace and the prospect of a mild easing in labour market conditions, the rise in inflation is expected to be relatively modest, with underlying inflation levelling out at around 3 per cent in the second half of 2006. Assuming no further increase in international oil prices, this would mean headline CPI inflation remaining close to 3 per cent over that period. Of course, if oil prices instead were to continue rising, CPI inflation would be higher and, should such a situation persist, it would increase the likelihood of significant second-round price effects and increases in inflation expectations. ", " Financial conditions at present do not appear to be inhibiting growth in demand and output. The cash rate has been unchanged since March at a level that is close to recent averages, and interest rates for business and household borrowers remain somewhat below average, reflecting the continued compression of interest rate margins for these borrowers over recent years. Credit growth has remained relatively stable at an annual rate of around 13 per cent, which should be ample to fund growth in private spending. However, the composition of credit growth has continued to shift. Growth in credit to the household sector has eased back from the exceptionally rapid pace seen a couple of years ago, reflecting the cooling in the Australian housing market and the more cautious approach to spending and balance-sheet expansion that households now seem to have adopted. At the same time, credit growth to businesses has been picking up after a number of years in which it had been unusually low. ", " In summary, the economic situation reviewed by the Board at its recent meetings has been one in which international conditions appeared likely to remain favourable to growth in Australia, while the domestic economy was continuing to operate at a relatively high level of capacity utilisation. Growth in demand and output remained solid, but had eased back from the peaks seen in recent years. The Board's assessment at the time of its September and October meetings was that these trends were likely to be consistent with demand growth over the period ahead being broadly in line with the growth of the economy's productive capacity. On that basis, while underlying inflation was forecast to rise modestly over the year ahead, inflationary trends overall were expected to remain consistent with the target over the medium term. ", " At its November meeting, the Board's judgment was that the September quarter inflation data did not significantly change that expectation. Nevertheless, the Board recognises that, with inflation likely to be close <span class=\"no-wrap\">to 3 per cent</span> for some time, policy will need to be responsive to any sign that demand and inflation pressures are stronger than currently expected. The Board will continue to monitor unfolding economic developments and make such adjustments to policy as may be required to promote sustainable growth of the economy with low inflation. ", " The global economy continues to expand at a good pace. In its latest <em>World Economic Outlook</em>, the IMF forecasts world GDP growth of 4¼ per cent in both 2005 and 2006 (Table 1). While this is lower than in 2004, it is well above the historical average (Graph 1). In addition to ongoing strong growth in the US and China, the economic situation in Japan has improved markedly since the start of the year, and growth also appears to be picking up in the rest of east Asia, in line with the emerging recovery in global ITC demand. High commodity prices and expansionary financial conditions continue to support solid growth in other emerging economies. The euro area remains a key area of weakness in the global economy, weighed down by low confidence and high unemployment. ", " Developments in the oil market have remained a major source of uncertainty about the outlook. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on US supply capacity briefly pushed the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil over <span class=\"no-wrap\">US$70 per barrel</span> in late August. Prices have since eased to around US$60 per barrel in early November; this is little changed relative to three months earlier (Graph 2). It is noteworthy that the higher price of oil has had little impact on core inflation outcomes for the major economies and global growth forecasts. Although headline inflation measures have increased significantly in the main industrialised economies, core measures excluding petrol have so far shown little upward movement stemming from second-round effects on other prices (Graph 3). The most recent IMF forecast for world growth in 2005 is virtually unchanged from the forecast published in <span class=\"no-wrap\">April 2004</span>, despite the projected level of oil prices for the year being double that for the earlier forecast. Similarly, a 40 per cent rise since April in the projected oil price for 2006 has not appreciably affected the IMF's forecast for growth in that year. ", " One reason why forecasts of global growth have not been scaled back is that the current high level of oil prices largely reflects strong demand; global oil supply has been rising overall, rather than contracting as occurred during the 1970s oil shocks (for more detail, see ‘<a href=\"#box-a\">Box A: Oil Price and Supply Developments</a>’). This strength of global demand is also evidenced by the increases seen in other commodity prices. Furthermore, the major oil producers have spent more of their oil revenue than usual on imports, especially from Europe and Asia, thereby moderating the geographical redistribution of demand that results from higher oil prices. ", " The US economy maintained its robust expansion into the second half of 2005, posting growth of 0.9 per cent in the September quarter and 3.6 per cent over the year (Graph 4), driven by ongoing strong consumption growth. While the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have resulted in some near-term weakness in the US economy, its underlying momentum remains strong. In the medium term, reconstruction activity should contribute to growth. ", " Consumption increased by 1 per cent in the September quarter and by 3.8 per cent over the year. This result reflected strength early in the quarter, with spending underpinned by the ongoing recovery in the labour market, rising asset prices and the resulting high level of consumer confidence. In nominal terms, house prices increased by 3.2 per cent in the June quarter and by 13.4 per cent over the year; this is the fastest growth in 25 years and the fastest real growth on record. Spending was more subdued later in the quarter, however, as motor vehicle discounting was scaled back and consumer sentiment fell sharply following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the associated spike in petrol prices. ", " Labour market conditions remained firm in the first part of the September quarter: non-farm payrolls grew <span class=\"no-wrap\">by 1.8 per cent</span> over the year to August, and the unemployment rate fell steadily to be 4.9 per cent in the month of August (Graph 5). However, the displacement of workers by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has resulted in some weaker labour market indicators more recently. Non-farm payrolls fell by 35,000 in September; the unemployment rate edged higher to 5.1 per cent; and initial jobless claims surged well above 400,000 in early September, although this has since unwound. Nonetheless, some of these outcomes were not as weak as many observers expected, and the employment indices in the ISM surveys remained at solid levels in September. ", " Business investment increased by 1.5 per cent in the September quarter, to be 7.8 per cent higher over the year. While this was slower than the rapid rate of almost 11 per cent recorded over 2004, conditions are supportive of further solid growth. Corporate profits continued to grow strongly in the June quarter, rising by <span class=\"no-wrap\">16 per cent</span> over the year, to be at the highest share of GDP since the late 1960s (Graph 6). External financing conditions also remain favourable and business sentiment measures are consistent with solid growth, despite some recent volatility. Core capital goods orders fell in September, but are 5½ per cent higher over the year, suggesting ongoing strong growth in equipment investment. ", " Headline CPI inflation rose to 4.7 per cent over the year to September, as petrol prices spiked following disruptions to production and refining caused by the hurricanes (Graph 7). Nevertheless, underlying annual inflation remained contained at around 2 per cent over the same period, according to the core measures of the CPI and the chain price index for personal consumption expenditure. However, the persistence of high energy prices and the pick-up in growth of unit labour costs, to 4.3 per cent over the year to the June quarter, point to ongoing inflationary pressure. The Federal Reserve has raised rates three times since the release of the last <em>Statement</em>, bringing the federal funds rate to 4 per cent. ", " Confidence in the Japanese recovery has increased, with real GDP growing by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, to be 2.2 per cent higher over the year (Graph 8). Business activity continues to expand, underpinned by healthier balance sheets, while the firmer labour market is stimulating household spending. With business and consumer sentiment at high levels, prospects for sustained growth appear favourable. ", " The business sector remains a key driver of the upswing, supported by rising demand and better financing conditions. Investment grew by 3.6 per cent in the June quarter, to be 7.6 per cent higher over the year. Forward indicators of investment are also positive: firms revised up their investment intentions in the September quarter Tankan survey, machinery orders have increased by 13.7 per cent over the year to August, and capacity utilisation remains at a high level in the manufacturing sector. Merchandise export growth has risen and should pick up further as the ITC sector recovers. Business sentiment indicators improved over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">September quarter</span> and are above long-run average levels. Corporate profits after interest were up <span class=\"no-wrap\">by 14.5 per cent</span> over the year to the June quarter, as firms appear to have worked off the excess debt and labour of the 1990s (Graph 9). Consistent with corporates' improved financial position, year-ended growth of underlying bank lending has turned positive for the first time since October 1998. ", " The outlook for the household sector has also firmed. Consumption increased by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter and consumer sentiment remains above long-run average levels. The faster pace of spending is being underpinned by improvements in the labour market, with cash earnings rising by 0.2 per cent over the year to September <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 10)</span>. Employment continues to expand at a solid pace, up by ½ per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year to September</span>, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in around seven years at 4.2 per cent. The job offers-to-applicants ratio, a forward indicator of employment growth, has increased to its highest level <span class=\"no-wrap\">in 13 years</span>, and employment intentions from business surveys point to continued hiring by firms. ", " Domestic corporate goods prices have increased by 1.7 per cent over the year to September, driven by high oil and commodity prices, but moderate consumer price deflation persists. The core CPI, which excludes fresh food prices, fell by 0.1 per cent over the year to September, with regulatory changes to electricity and telecommunications contributing to falling consumer prices over the past year. Asset prices have improved, with land prices increasing in the Tokyo area for the first time in 15 years and equity prices rising to their highest level in over four years. ", " The Chinese economy has carried significant momentum into the second half of 2005, with real GDP increasing by 9½ per cent over the year to the September quarter. Year-ended growth of nominal industrial production also remains strong at 16½ per cent in September. While the mix of GDP growth appears better balanced than <span class=\"no-wrap\">in early 2004</span>, growth is still highly dependent on investment spending. The value of urban fixed asset investment increased by almost 30 per cent over the year to September, considerably faster than the pace of retail sales growth, which nevertheless remains strong at around 13 per cent. Year-ended growth of the money stock also picked up noticeably, to nearly 18 per cent in September, above the official target of 15 per cent for 2005, while credit grew by around 14 per cent over the same period. Export growth slowed to 26 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year to September</span>, while growth of imports picked up to a fairly similar rate. Although the trade surplus has narrowed in recent months, it remains large by historical standards, so a significant widening of the current account surplus is likely in 2005. ", " Inflationary pressures remain contained despite strong output growth and rising commodity prices. Consumer price inflation eased to 0.9 per cent over the year to September, as the effect of last year's run-up in food prices faded; consumers have been relatively insulated from rising fuel costs by government regulation of petrol prices. Prices continue to rise more rapidly at the producer level, but the pace has slowed, to 4½ per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">year to September</span>. ", " Growth in the rest of east Asia appears to be picking up, after easing in 2004. Real GDP expanded by 1.4 per cent in the June quarter to be 4.3 per cent higher over the year (Graph 11). Quarterly GDP growth was particularly strong in Hong Kong and Singapore; Hong Kong continues to benefit from increasing integration with China, while activity in Singapore was boosted by its biomedical industry. Real GDP rebounded in Thailand as tourism improved following tsunami-related falls in the March quarter, and the recovery in Korea continued to gain traction. September quarter data from Singapore and Korea show further gains in year-ended GDP growth. ", " More recent indicators are also consistent with firmer growth in the region, due in part to recovering demand for ITC products. After a flat patch earlier in the year, growth of aggregate industrial production rebounded to <span class=\"no-wrap\">7.2 per cent</span> over the year to August, and merchandise export growth picked up to 15.2 per cent over the same period. Progress has been made in reducing ITC inventories, and ITC exports have accelerated to show growth of around 20 per cent over the year to August. World semiconductor sales increased by nearly 9 per cent in the September quarter, and sales from non-Japan Asia have been growing at a stronger rate than the total. The US semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio, an indicator of future production, has risen to be above one in August and September, implying that orders are running above current shipments. ", " Domestic demand remains firm across most of the region. Aggregate investment growth picked up in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">June quarter</span>, spurred by relatively high rates of capacity utilisation. Solid consumption growth has been encouraged by favourable financial and labour market conditions. The unemployment rate continues to trend down in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. Growth of domestic demand in Korea had lagged behind the rest of the region in the past few years, as households repaired their balance sheets, but conditions have recently been improving. Consumption increased for the fifth consecutive quarter in September, to be 3.9 per cent higher over the year. The credit card delinquency ratio is now back below the levels seen prior to the credit card crisis, and household demand for credit has begun to increase. ", " High oil prices continue to put pressure on headline consumer price inflation across the region, and in some cases this has been amplified by reductions in fuel subsidies. Adverse weather conditions have also boosted food prices in some countries. Aggregate consumer price inflation picked up to 3.9 per cent over the year to September, from a low of 2.9 per cent earlier in the year. Although interest rates remain relatively low, monetary policy has been tightened across the region in the past three months. Indonesia experienced a short bout of financial market turbulence in August, as higher oil prices raised concerns about the budgetary cost of fuel subsidies and falling foreign reserves. In early October, the Indonesian government announced a reduction in fuel subsidies, which raised average fuel prices by 126 per cent. As a result, Indonesian consumer price inflation jumped to almost 18 per cent over the year to October, from 9.1 per cent over the year to September. In response to both the market turbulence and inflationary pressures, Bank Indonesia has increased interest rates by a total of <span class=\"no-wrap\">375 basis</span> points since early August. ", " Strengthening growth in the Indian economy is providing a significant boost to the global expansion. In purchasing power parity terms, India is now the world's fourth-largest economy, and accounted for 6 per cent of <span class=\"no-wrap\">world GDP in 2004</span>. Real GDP expanded by 2.4 per cent in the June quarter and by 8.2 per cent over the year, which is well above India's average growth rate of 5½ per cent over the past 30 years (Graph 12). The manufacturing and services sectors contributed strongly to growth, while agricultural output was weaker, following last year's below-average monsoon season. More recently, industrial production grew by 7.4 per cent over the year to August, and both imports and exports grew strongly over the year to the September quarter, despite some monthly volatility. Wholesale price inflation picked up to 4.0 per cent over the year to September, in part reflecting the government's recent decision to raise administered fuel prices. The Reserve Bank of India raised interest rates by 25 basis points in October to 5.25 per cent. ", " In New Zealand, economic growth has eased from the rapid pace of 2004, but remains firm. Real GDP surprised on the upside in the June quarter, increasing by 1.1 per cent in the quarter and by 2.6 per cent over the year, on strong domestic demand. While consumption and dwelling investment growth eased, business investment growth picked up in response to high profitability and capacity utilisation. The labour market remains tight, with the unemployment rate at 3.7 per cent in the June quarter. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised the official cash rate by 25 basis points to 7 per cent in late October. Annual consumer price inflation rose to <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.4 per cent</span> in the September quarter, which is above the RBNZ's target band of 1–3 per cent. ", " Conditions in the euro area remained weak in the June quarter, as domestic demand faltered. Euro area real GDP grew by only 0.3 per cent in the June quarter, and was 1.1 per cent higher over the year (Table 2). Growth in domestic demand in the quarter was subdued, with a run-up in inventories the main contributor to output growth. Growth has slowed in most countries over the past year: consumption fell in Germany and France, leading to negligible growth in both countries in the June quarter, while stronger growth in Italy and the Netherlands might simply have been a bounce-back from weak first-quarter results. The exception is Spain, where solid growth has continued, driven by ongoing increases in house prices and investment. ", " More recent indicators suggest household consumption remained subdued in the third quarter, with consumers pessimistic about prospects for recovery and concerned about ongoing political uncertainty; euro area retail sales grew by 1.6 per cent over the year to August, and fell in Germany. However, conditions in the labour market are gradually improving; the euro area unemployment rate fell to 8.6 per cent in August, from 8.9 per cent at the end of 2004. ", " There have been some tentative signs of improvement in recent data for the business sector. Industrial production picked up in August to be 2.5 per cent higher in year-ended terms, and the upward trajectory of the manufacturing PMI since May is suggestive of further growth in the near future. Export orders were 4.4 per cent higher over the year to August, which points to strengthening exports and production. But among the larger countries, the strength in industrial production has so far been concentrated in Germany, with production weaker in France and Italy. Nevertheless, business confidence has strengthened since its trough in May, and was above long-run average levels in October. ", " Headline inflation was 2.5 per cent over the year to October, due in large part to high petrol prices (Graph 13). The effect of energy prices on underlying inflation has been muted to date, with core inflation of only <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.3 per cent</span> over the year to September. Nevertheless, the ECB is expressing greater concern about the potential for second-round effects of oil prices on inflation and wages. ", " The UK economy has slowed sharply since mid 2004, with domestic demand decelerating in response to higher interest rates and the cooling housing market. According to preliminary data, GDP grew by 0.4 per cent in the September quarter, to be 1.6 per cent higher over the year. This slowing is also reflected in the labour market; the claimant count unemployment rate rose to 2.8 per cent in September from a low of 2.6 per cent at the start of the year. However, the housing market appears to have stabilised, and house prices rose by around 3 per cent over the year to September. Furthermore, conditions in the business sector appear to be improving, with manufacturing production having recovered somewhat since its sharp fall earlier in the year. The manufacturing PMI has risen sharply since May, suggesting the recovery in production will continue, and other indicators of business confidence imply that there is some cautious optimism amongst firms. ", " After around 18 months in which the headline inflation rate was below the 2 per cent target adopted in December 2003, hikes in oil prices have lifted it to 2.5 per cent over the year to September; underlying inflation rose to 1.6 per cent over the same period. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee reduced the repo rate in August, from 4¾ per cent to 4½ per cent, citing subdued output growth. ", " The US Federal Reserve has continued to tighten monetary policy over recent months. Since mid 2004 it has increased the policy rate by 25 basis points at each of its twelve meetings, a cumulative tightening of <span class=\"no-wrap\">300 basis points (Graph 14)</span>. This has lifted the Fed funds rate to 4 per cent, which is still a little below the average over the past decade. Market expectations about the pace of future tightening have fluctuated over the past three months, mainly due to uncertainty caused by hurricanes. Following Hurricane Katrina, markets significantly scaled back their expectations such that only one further tightening by the Fed was anticipated. However, after it became clear that the Fed did not expect any ongoing threat to economic growth, whereas higher energy costs had the potential to add to inflation pressures, markets once again priced in more tightening. This has been reinforced by the release of data showing that the US economy remains strong as well as further comments by FOMC members highlighting the risks to the inflation outlook. Markets are currently expecting the Federal Reserve to raise rates by a further 75 basis points over the next six months, but rates are expected to plateau beyond that. ", " The European Central Bank (ECB) has not changed monetary policy since June 2003, but recent comments from ECB officials have highlighted growing concerns about the effect on inflationary expectations of high oil prices. Consequently, markets have factored in the possibility of a 25 basis point increase in the policy rate early in 2006. Similarly, although the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has not changed the stance of monetary policy for a long period, some market participants have interpreted recent BoJ comments that deflation is expected to end next year as a signal that it may soon start to move away from the quantitative easing policy (Table 3). ", " The Bank of Canada increased its policy rate by 25 basis points at both its September and October meetings <span class=\"no-wrap\">to 3 per cent</span>, reflecting increased inflationary pressures. Markets are expecting rates to be increased a further <span class=\"no-wrap\">50 basis points</span> over coming months. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand increased its policy rate by 25 basis points to 7 per cent at its late October meeting, against a background of rising inflation, a strong economy and continuing rises in house prices. ", " In contrast, the official policy rate in the UK was reduced by 25 basis points to 4.5 per cent in August. The policy rate was not changed at the subsequent two meetings, and markets expect the Bank of England to keep it steady over the coming six months. Elsewhere in Europe, rates have remained unchanged in Sweden and Switzerland over the past three months. ", " In emerging markets, Indonesia's central bank has increased its interest rate target by a cumulative <span class=\"no-wrap\">375 basis</span> points, to 12¼ per cent, in five steps since the new monetary framework was introduced in July. The increases were aimed at stemming speculative pressure against the rupiah as well as combating mounting inflationary pressures. Central banks in the Czech Republic, Chile, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and India also tightened monetary policy, citing increased inflationary pressures. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) increased the interest rates that Chinese banks can pay on US and Hong Kong dollar denominated deposits in both August and October by a total of 87.5 basis points. This was an attempt to ease upward speculative pressure on the renminbi. In other emerging markets, Hungary, Poland, Mexico and Brazil lowered policy rates, as inflation concerns eased. ", " Yields on US 10-year government bonds have continued to fluctuate broadly within the 4 to 4½ per cent range which has generally prevailed over the past year. Yields fell to the bottom of the range in early September on fears that Hurricane Katrina would have a significant dampening impact on economic growth. Over the past two months, however, yields have risen back to be just above 4½ per cent following the publication of robust economic data, as well as comments from the Federal Reserve that the disruption to economic activity from the hurricane was likely to be temporary and that monetary policy remains expansionary. The recent fluctuations in the nominal yield have been due primarily to variations in real yields, with inflation expectations remaining relatively stable (Graph 15). ", " The German 10-year bond yield fell to a new post-war low of around 3 per cent in September, in part due to political uncertainty surrounding the German election (Graph 16). Yields have since risen from these lows as comments from ECB speakers have highlighted the risk that high oil prices will flow through to inflation. Nonetheless, with the economic outlook more favourable in the US, the spread between German and US 10-year bond yields has widened further; yields in the two countries had been fairly similar up to mid 2004. Yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds increased over the past three months as optimism about the economic outlook and prospects for further economic reform increased following Prime Minister Koizumi's clear election win. ", " Bond yields on emerging-market and corporate debt remain near historically low levels. Emerging-market spreads have been little changed over the past three months, with the exception of Indonesia where spreads on sovereign debt widened significantly reflecting concerns about the impact of higher oil prices on the fiscal position <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 17)</span>. Despite renewed pressure on the automotive sector after a US auto parts supplier filed for bankruptcy, US corporate spreads to Treasuries have increased only marginally over the past three months. ", " The performance of the major global equity markets has diverged over the past three months (Graph 18, <span class=\"no-wrap\">Table 4)</span>. US share prices have fallen slightly on concerns about the impact of higher oil prices on consumer spending and fears that inflationary pressures are building. Stocks related to discretionary consumer spending, including auto-related and home furnishings stocks, have been particularly weak. In contrast Japanese equity prices have increased significantly over this period, with the TOPIX up by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">24 per cent</span>. A more positive economic outlook, as well as heightened expectations of further reform after the Koizumi government won an absolute majority in the recent elections, has supported the gains, although concerns that growth in global consumption may slow if oil prices remain high tempered the overall rise. European equity prices also increased strongly in the first part of the period, but fell back more recently on concerns about oil prices and inflationary pressures, and are broadly unchanged over the three months. ", " In emerging markets, average share prices in Latin America have risen by around 10 per cent since the previous <em>Statement</em>, with particularly strong gains in Brazil and Mexico. They have also increased in South Korea and India with share prices up around 35 per cent over the year to date in the former and around 20 per cent in the latter. In contrast, share prices fell in Taiwan and Indonesia, reversing some of the strong growth seen earlier this year. ", " The US dollar has appreciated against most of the major currencies over the past three months (Table 5, <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 19)</span>. The dollar has been particularly strong against the yen, appreciating by 4 per cent to its highest level since September 2003 (Graph 20). This was despite favourable political and economic news in Japan. Against the euro, the dollar has appreciated by around 2 per cent and is up 12 per cent since its low point in late 2004. On a major currency trade-weighted basis the US dollar has appreciated 1 per cent over the past three months to be 8 per cent higher over the year to date. This rise has been limited in part by the strength of the Canadian dollar, which reached a 13-year high against the US dollar due to strength in commodity prices and policy tightening by the Bank of Canada. ", " The Chinese renminbi has remained fairly stable against the US dollar following its 2.1 per cent revaluation in July, appreciating by just 0.3 per cent since then (Graph 21). Expectations for further appreciation indicated by the non-deliverable forward (NDF) market have been scaled back slightly to 3½ per cent over the next year. <span class=\"no-wrap\">In late September</span> the Chinese authorities widened the trading band for the renminbi against <span class=\"no-wrap\">non-US dollar</span> currencies to ±3 per cent around the daily fixing rate, from ±1½ per cent previously. The band against the US dollar was retained at ±0.3 per cent. ", " The Indonesian rupiah weakened noticeably in late August as the interaction of rising oil prices and government fuel subsidies heightened concerns about the fiscal position. However, the currency recovered over subsequent months after official interest rates were raised and fuel subsidies were reduced (Graph 22). The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reiterated the policy it adopted in April 2004 of allowing a modest and gradual appreciation of the Singapore dollar against a basket of currencies. Other east Asian currencies have generally depreciated modestly against the US dollar over the past three months. ", " The Australian dollar has depreciated over recent months against the US dollar and is slightly lower on <span class=\"no-wrap\">a trade-weighted basis (Graph 23)</span>. The fall against the US dollar was partly offset by rises against some <span class=\"no-wrap\">Asian currencies</span> including the yen (Graph 24). Against the US dollar, the exchange rate is currently just below the lower end of the trading range of US75 cents to US80 cents that has prevailed since late last year, and is around the middle of the year's range on a trade-weighted basis. Over this period, the exchange rate of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Australian dollar</span> has been affected by countervailing forces: the interest rate differential relative to the US has narrowed, putting downward pressure on the currency, and A$ Eurobond issuance has declined noticeably; but commodity markets have strengthened, which has been supportive for the currency. ", " Investor sentiment towards the Australian dollar remains favourable, with speculators continuing to hold net long positions against the US dollar on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (Graph 25). The Australian and Canadian dollars are the only major currencies in which speculative positioning remains long against the US dollar. Volatility in the Australian dollar is below its post-float average, following a brief spike around the time of Hurricane Katrina <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 26)</span>. ", " The Bank has continued to accumulate foreign exchange reserves over the past few months, buying foreign exchange when the exchange rate was toward the upper end of its recent trading range. Overall, net reserves have increased to $27¾ billion, from $26½ billion at the end of July. The Bank's holdings of foreign exchange under swap arrangements, which are largely determined by domestic liquidity management operations, declined by A$3¼ billion over the past three months to A$27 billion. ", " Domestic expenditure recorded solid growth over the first half of 2005, after slowing over 2004 from the rapid rates registered in the two preceding years. In the June quarter, business investment, public demand and dwelling investment all increased strongly, while household consumption continued to grow at a moderate pace. Net exports again declined in the quarter, although by less than in earlier quarters. Overall, real GDP was estimated to have increased by 1.3 per cent in the June quarter and by 2.6 per cent over the year (Table 6). ", " The outlook for growth remains favourable, reflecting in particular the stimulus coming from the strong terms of trade. Conditions in the business sector are positive, with profitability and capacity utilisation at high levels, and activity data for the housing sector continue to suggest a mild downturn by historical standards. Household consumption growth is likely to remain moderate, with the impact of higher petrol prices and the levelling-out in house prices partly offsetting the support to household income from the favourable labour market conditions and recent tax cuts. Slower growth in domestic demand, together with a gradual recovery in exports, should see the drag from net exports continue to ease. Rural exports in particular are expected to pick up gradually following the improvement in farm sector conditions in recent months. ", " Consumption grew by 0.7 per cent in both the March and June quarters, and by 3.0 per cent over the year, down from a peak annual rate of around 6½ per cent in early 2004. In the June quarter, expenditure on household services increased solidly, while spending on goods was unchanged. More recently, the volume of retail sales was up by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter and sales of motor vehicles increased by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.8 per cent</span> (Graph 27). Nonetheless, consumer sentiment has fallen in recent months, with the <span class=\"no-wrap\">Westpac-Melbourne Institute</span> measure a little below its long-run average in October. The decline in sentiment has been attributed mostly to higher petrol prices, although concerns about the impact of terrorist attacks and natural disasters abroad have also been noted. The large impact of higher petrol prices on sentiment is perhaps surprising, given that petrol represented only around 3 per cent of household consumption expenditure in <span class=\"no-wrap\">2004/05 (see <a href=\"#box-c\">Box C</a> for</span> further discussion of oil usage in the Australian economy). ", " Household consumption growth over the past year has been in line with income growth, leaving the saving rate broadly unchanged. Household credit growth has continued to outpace growth in both income and assets. The growth in household borrowing contributed to an increase in debt-servicing costs, which rose to 9.8 per cent of disposable income in the June quarter (Graph 28). In addition, revised aggregate data suggest that the household sector is still withdrawing equity from the housing stock, although at a much slower pace than the peak in 2003. ", " After a fall of 5 per cent over the three quarters to March quarter 2005, dwelling investment increased <span class=\"no-wrap\">by 3.3 per cent</span> in the June quarter, with increased spending on both new construction and alterations and additions. The strength in the June quarter came despite an earlier fall in commencements, and partly reflected a pull-forward in activity ahead of changes to Victoria's environmental legislation effective 1 July. Looking through the volatility, housing indicators remain weakest in New South Wales and Victoria, while conditions in other states have been firm (Graph 29). ", " Forward-looking indicators of housing activity point to some near-term easing in construction. The number of building approvals declined by 12 per cent in the September quarter, with falls in approvals for both houses and medium-density dwellings (Graph 30). The Housing Industry Association new home sales series – which are commitments to build – has also recently declined. Nonetheless, with further large amounts of work yet to be done, especially in the more buoyant states, the current downturn in house building activity is likely to be shallow by the standards of previous cycles. ", " The value of housing loan approvals fell by 1.8 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, as a decline in demand by investors more than offset increased demand by <span class=\"no-wrap\">owner-occupiers</span> (Graph 31). However, at around $13 billion, the monthly value of loan approvals was still above its average level in 2004. The value of loan approvals for owner-occupiers was 12 per cent above the level of a year earlier, mostly due to an increase in loans for the purchase of existing dwellings, and remains around its <span class=\"no-wrap\">late 2003</span> level. In contrast, the value of loan approvals for investors was down around 4 per cent over the year and by around one-third from its late 2003 peak. Housing credit growth has also moderated in recent months, recording an annualised rate of 12.1 per cent for the six months to September, consistent with the current more subdued level of loan approvals. ", " Average nationwide house prices appear to have remained fairly stable in recent quarters (Graph 32, Table 7). The APM composition-adjusted measure suggests that nationwide prices fell modestly in the September quarter but were broadly unchanged over the year. Most measures continue to suggest that house prices in Sydney have softened over the past year. House prices in Perth appear to have risen strongly over the same period, while the different measures suggest reasonably flat or slightly higher prices in other capitals. ", " Recent auctions data are consistent with conditions in the housing market remaining subdued. Over the past few months, clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne have fluctuated around levels considerably lower than their averages over the past five years, and auction volumes remain low. However, auctions account for a relatively small share of total properties sold. ", " Conditions in the business sector remain favourable, as indicated by strong profits and solid investment activity. Nonetheless, surveys have tended to show some deterioration in business conditions compared with those <span class=\"no-wrap\">last year</span>, especially in the manufacturing sector. The NAB survey of the non-farm sector indicated that business conditions softened modestly in the September quarter, although they remained well above long-run average levels (Graph 33). Capacity utilisation eased slightly in the quarter but also remained at high levels, particularly in the mining and infrastructure sectors (Graph 34). Firms cited the lack of availability of suitable labour as a significant constraint on increasing their output. Other surveys of the non-farm economy provide a more mixed picture of developments. The ACCI Survey of Investor Confidence reported that actual and expected business conditions picked up in the September quarter, while the Sensis survey of small and medium-sized businesses suggested a modest weakening in conditions. ", " The manufacturing sector has for some time reported a weaker business climate. The ACCI-Westpac survey indicated that business conditions deteriorated in the September quarter, although they remained a little above long-run average levels. The latest AIG quarterly survey indicated a more subdued level of activity in the manufacturing sector, with the AIG Performance of Manufacturing Index indicating that weak conditions continued into October. ", " Prospects for the farm sector continue to brighten. Recent forecasts suggest the national wheat crop will be slightly above its average of the past five years. The earlier downside risks to the outlook, owing to late planting and dry conditions, have diminished with recent rains in major growing areas. While these rains have improved the outlook for grain production, they are yet to significantly alleviate the shortage of stored water, and many parts of eastern Australia remain drought-declared. ", " The strong upswing in business investment seen in recent years continued in the first half of 2005, with real business investment increasing by 15 per cent over the year to the June quarter, underpinned by high capacity utilisation, healthy profits and falling prices for imported capital goods (Graph 35). Business investment growth in the June quarter was driven by spending on both machinery &amp; equipment and non-residential building. Growth in capital spending in recent quarters has been particularly rapid in mining – consistent with surging profits due to the high level of commodity prices – but there has also been broad-based strength in other sectors. ", " Conditions remain supportive of further growth in business investment, with sound prospects for the domestic and world economies and a favourable funding environment. The latest capital expenditure (Capex) survey suggests a solid increase in firms' intentions for real machinery &amp; equipment investment in 2005/06, reflecting a pick-up in spending in the transport &amp; storage, finance &amp; insurance, and manufacturing sectors. The Rabobank survey suggests that investment intentions for farm equipment (which are not covered in the Capex survey) have recovered to their pre-drought levels. ", " Forward-looking indicators of non-residential construction also suggest a high level of activity in coming quarters <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 36)</span>. Even though the level of engineering construction activity has more than doubled over the past four years, activity is expected to be supported by the near-record amount of this work yet to be done. The outlook for the non-residential building component is not as strong, with the average volume of work approved so far in 2005 around the current level of activity. ", " Corporate profitability has strengthened further, with a strong June quarter outcome underpinning a <span class=\"no-wrap\">10.4 per cent</span> increase in the gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations over the year. This result primarily reflected a large increase in the profits of mining companies, which have benefited from solid world demand and the large increase in commodity prices (Graph 37). Profit growth has been substantially weaker in the non-mining non-financial sectors, and as a share of GDP these profits have declined over the past year, although from a high level. Businesses across a range of sectors have recently noted that tight labour market conditions and high fuel and raw material prices have begun to affect their profit margins. ", " Businesses continue to have ample access to financing, with both external and internal funding as a share of GDP well above their historical averages. Business credit increased by an annualised rate of 15.5 per cent in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">six months to September</span>. ", " The labour market remained strong in the September quarter, despite a decline in employment in the month of September for the first time in over a year. In four-quarter-ended terms total employment grew <span class=\"no-wrap\">by 3.6 per cent</span>, with part-time employment increasing by 4.7 per cent and full-time employment <span class=\"no-wrap\">by 3.2 per cent (Graph 38)</span>. The participation rate was unchanged from the June quarter, at 64.6 per cent, while the unemployment rate fell to 5.0 per cent in the quarter, although it ticked up to 5.1 per cent in <span class=\"no-wrap\">the month of September</span>. ", " Most industries experienced sizeable employment gains over the year to the September quarter, with strong contributions to growth from the retail, construction and business services sectors. Only three industries experienced falling employment: manufacturing, personal &amp; other services, and wholesale trade. ", " In the September quarter, employment increased in all states except Victoria (Table 8). The Western Australian labour market posted the strongest performance, with annual employment growth around 7 per cent and an unemployment rate below 4½ per cent. While New South Wales recorded the weakest year-ended growth in employment, the pace has been picking up and is now well above its long-term average. While the performance of the Western Australian labour market has clearly been stronger than other states, the range of unemployment rates across the states has tended to narrow over recent quarters, pointing to some convergence in state labour market conditions. ", " While forward-looking indicators of labour demand moderated in the September quarter, they generally remained at high levels (Graph 39). The ACCI-Westpac and NAB measures of firms' hiring intentions have been above long-run average levels for some time. The ABS measure of vacancies fell by 3.9 per cent in the three months to August, but as a proportion of the labour force remained around <span class=\"no-wrap\">25 per cent</span> higher than its decade average. The pace of year-ended growth in the ANZ internet-based job advertisements series eased in the quarter from its recent high level, while the number of print-based vacancies continued to fall. Liaison reports indicate that skill shortages remain acute across a broad range of occupations. ", " The trade deficit has narrowed recently, to around 2 per cent of GDP in the June quarter (Graph 40). More recent data suggest the trade deficit was broadly unchanged in the September quarter. The narrowing in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">first half of 2005</span> was mainly driven by the sharply higher terms of trade, but there were also some tentative signs of a stronger contribution from volumes. Growth in import volumes has eased in line with the moderation in domestic demand growth, while export volumes have been picking up gradually, driven by the resource and manufactured components. The net income deficit narrowed in the first half of 2005. It was nonetheless much higher than a year or so earlier, largely because of the boost from strong profits of mining companies with foreign ownership. Reflecting these developments, the current account deficit fell significantly in the June quarter, to an initial estimate of 5.7 per cent of GDP, down from a peak of 7.2 per cent of GDP at the end of 2004. ", " Export earnings increased sharply over the year to the September quarter, largely reflecting rapid growth in export prices, especially for resource commodities (Graph 41). Resource export earnings increased by almost <span class=\"no-wrap\">40                          per cent</span> over the year to the June quarter, buoyed in particular by rising prices for Australia's two largest commodity exports, coal and iron ore. There was also an 8½ per cent increase in volumes over this period, following expansions in production capacity. Resource export earnings continued to increase in the September quarter, though this appears to reflect further price rises. Export volumes are likely to have been held back in the quarter by some temporary disruptions to port loading capacity and LNG production. The outlook for resource exports remains positive, with expansions in productive and infrastructure capacity underway. ", " The volume of rural exports fell in 2004/05 overall, as the smaller winter crop led to a large decline in cereals exports. There was a modest recovery in exports in the June quarter, with volumes increasing by 3 per cent, but there was no further improvement in the September quarter. The more favourable weather conditions in recent months have resulted in a better outlook for crop exports, although at least initially, they are likely to encourage herd rebuilding and thereby reduce meat exports. Overall, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecasts a fall in total rural exports in 2005/06. Beef exports could also be affected from early 2006 if the lifting of BSE-related bans increases competition in the Japanese market from US beef. ", " The volume of manufactured exports increased strongly in the June quarter, following moderate growth over the previous year. Although lumpy one-off items accounted for some of this strength, there also appears to have been some underlying growth. Monthly data suggest that both manufactured export earnings and volumes fell slightly in the September quarter, as these lumpy exports unwound. Although trading partner growth remains firm, which would suggest a positive outlook for manufactured exports, liaison with firms continues to highlight difficulty in maintaining international competitiveness. ", " After falling in the June quarter, the volume of services exports appears to have stabilised in the September quarter, notwithstanding the pick-up in short-term visitor arrivals. Services exports remain slightly below their 2001 level; for travel services, this has at least partly reflected declining average visitor expenditure, as visitor arrivals have been well above 2001 levels for some time. Looking forward, continued favourable growth among Australia's trading partners should support demand for exports of both travel-related and other services. ", " Growth in import volumes has eased during 2005 from the rapid rates seen in 2004. Import volumes grew at an average quarterly rate of 2.2 per cent in the first half of 2005, down from an average of 3.3 per cent per <span class=\"no-wrap\">quarter in 2004 (Graph 42)</span>. This slowing is consistent with the easing in growth of domestic demand over the past year and a half and the relative stability of the exchange rate over this period, after a period of significant appreciation, and was evident in imports of all major categories. There appears to have been a further slowing in the September quarter, with volumes estimated to have fallen slightly. ", " The net income deficit (NID) increased sharply over the second half of 2004, mainly because of a marked increase in earnings on foreign direct investment in Australia, in line with the exceptionally strong growth in mining profits. It has since narrowed over the first half of 2005, to be $7.6 billion or 3.4 per cent of GDP in the June quarter, but this was still around 19 per cent higher than a year earlier (Graph 43). A large proportion of the equity earnings that drove these fluctuations were retained by Australia-based companies and did not result in actual payment flows. However, the standard balance of payments methodology includes retained earnings on direct equity investments in the NID, as well as distributed income from this and other forms of foreign investment. Excluding undistributed and reinvested earnings, the NID has been broadly flat at around 3 per cent of GDP since <span class=\"no-wrap\">early 2003</span> (see ‘<a href=\"#box-c\">Box C: Australia's Net Income Deficit</a>’, May 2005 <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>). ", " Favourable global economic conditions and higher contract prices for Australia's coal and iron ore exports contributed to a 30 per cent increase in the RBA index of commodity prices (ICP) over the year to October in SDR terms <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Table 9)</span>. The series is now at its highest level since it began in 1982. The index rose by 2.7 per cent over the three months to October, reflecting solid increases in base metals and rural commodity prices. In Australian dollar terms, commodity prices rose by 2.1 per cent over the <span class=\"no-wrap\">three months to October</span>, and were up by <span class=\"no-wrap\">23 per cent</span> over the year. ", " As noted in previous <em>Statements</em>, contracts for the export of iron ore and hard coking coal were negotiated with US dollar price increases of about 70 per cent and 120 per cent respectively, effective from the start of April, with a more modest increase in steaming coal prices. Data to September indicate that essentially all of the increase in iron ore and steaming coal contract prices has now passed through to export prices, but not all of the rise in coking coal contract prices has been reflected in the average price received by exporters. The latter is reportedly partly due to some delay in fulfilling obligations under the previous year's contracts, so a further small increase in coking coal export prices is expected in the near term. ", " The RBA index of base metals prices increased by 6 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to October, reaching its highest level since 1989. Copper and aluminium prices showed particular strength, supported by strong global demand and strikes at some large overseas copper mines. The gold price also rose strongly over this period, primarily reflecting market concerns about US inflation, although market commentary suggested that concern about terrorist activity also contributed. ", " Average rural commodity prices increased by around 5 per cent in SDR terms over the three months to October, largely owing to solid growth in the price of wheat, as forecasts of global supply in 2005/06 were pared back. Sugar and cotton prices also rose in response to stronger demand for ethanol and cotton textiles, as high oil prices have been boosting the cost of petrol and petroleum-based synthetic fibres that compete with these products. ", " The recent large increases in iron ore and coal export prices underpinned a 5.8 per cent increase in the terms of trade in the June quarter (Graph 44). This took them to their highest level since 1974, having increased by around 26 per cent over the past three years. Given the rise in commodity prices since June, the terms of trade are likely to have experienced a further modest rise in the September quarter. ", " In real trade-weighted terms, the Australian dollar was around 13 per cent above its post-float average in early November, and has been broadly stable around this level since early 2004 (Graph 45). At its current level, the exchange rate is restraining activity in some trade-exposed businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector. However, for the economy as a whole, the benefits from the increased terms of trade are offsetting the contractionary effects of the current level of the exchange rate. ", " Conditions in domestic money and bond markets have followed those in US markets over recent months as investors have continued to assess the outlook for domestic growth and inflation against the backdrop of higher oil prices and other overseas developments. ", " Short-term interest rates fell through most of August, particularly late in the month on news of Hurricane Katrina <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 46)</span>. By early September, these rates indicated that markets were pricing in some chance of easier monetary policy in the first half of 2006. The falls, however, were mainly in response to a sharp move lower in US short-term yields at the time and were quickly unwound as US yields began their retracement in early September. Local short-term yields continued to edge a little higher over subsequent weeks on the back of generally positive economic news and expectations that monetary policy may need to be tightened at some point, to counter a build-up of inflationary pressures. ", " Bond yields have moved in a similar but more pronounced fashion to short-term rates (Graph 47). From mid August to early September, long-term bond yields fell by around 30 basis points, mainly on concerns that rising energy costs may slow the pace of global, and hence domestic, growth. Concerns about the broad consequences of the hurricanes around the Gulf of Mexico added to the falls. Yields subsequently rose as these concerns diminished and domestic data releases generally maintained a healthy tone. Yields on 10-year bonds are currently around 5.5 per cent, a little higher than at the time of the last <em>Statement</em>. Yields on inflation-linked bonds fell to their lowest recorded level, of 2.3 per cent, in late August and at 2.5 per cent are still low by historical standards. ", " With local bond yields moving broadly in line with those in the US, the spread between the yields on Australian and US <span class=\"no-wrap\">10-year</span> bonds has generally remained a bit below 100 basis points over the past few months. At these levels, the spread remains well below its average for the past few years (Graph 48). ", " Despite the net rise in bond yields since the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>, they are still low by historical standards and the yield curve remains unusually flat (Graph 49). As mentioned in previous <em>Statements</em>, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the stance of monetary policy from the current level of bond yields because of the strong influence of US bond yields, which are unusually low. A clearer measure of the markets' expectations for the cash rate over the next year or so can be gauged from overnight indexed swaps. ", " Spreads on corporate bonds remain at very low levels, suggesting there has been little change in market participants' perceptions of corporate credit risk. Spreads to swap rates on AAA-rated conventional bonds have tightened a little over recent months, and are currently around 10 basis points lower than a year ago (Graph 50). AAA-rated tranches of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) are being issued at near-record low spreads, with demand from domestic and offshore investors remaining strong. Recent issues have come onto the market at spreads of around 15–20 basis points, compared with around 30–35 basis points a couple of years ago. ", " There has also been little movement in credit risk perceptions of lower-rated corporate borrowers over recent months, despite the rise in corporate spreads in the US following several prominent companies moving into bankruptcy. Spreads between corporate bonds and swap rates, and the premia on credit default swaps, have remained near historical lows (Graph 51). One factor explaining these tight spreads is the strength in demand for Australian corporate debt coming from offshore investors. In the first half of 2005, these investors increased their holdings of domestic non-government debt by $9 billion to $38 billion, which is 22 per cent of total outstandings. In contrast, over the past year or so, domestic bonds fund managers have shifted their allocations towards government bonds and cash. <a href=\"#box-b\">Box B</a> discusses some recent trends in the portfolio decisions of these fund managers. ", " Most intermediaries' variable indicator lending rates have remained constant since the time of the previous <em>Statement</em>. However, competitive pressures remain: a few mortgage originators have reduced the indicator rates on their standard and basic variable-rate housing loans by up to 15 basis points in recent months; and discounts to indicator rates on housing loans appear to have become larger and more widespread. Although variable indicator rates on housing loans were unchanged over 2004, the average actual rate paid on new housing loans is estimated to have declined by around 15 basis points over that period (Graph 52). The discounts advertised by lenders in recent months suggest that this widening of the spread between indicator and actual rates has continued in 2005. ", " Businesses have also benefited from increased competition among lenders. Since 2002, the average interest rate paid by businesses on variable-rate loans has increased by around 50 basis points compared with an increase in the cash rate of 125 basis points. As a result, the average business interest rate has been below its decade average for several years (Graph 52). The relatively low level of business interest rates is consistent with the relatively low spreads on corporate bonds. ", " Interest rates on fixed-rate housing loans have fallen in the past couple of months, following a period of six months in which they were fairly stable. On average, the major banks' 3-year rate, the most popular term for fixed-rate loans, has fallen by 30 basis points, to 6.55 per cent (Graph 53 and Table 10). These moves appear to be in response to the decline in funding costs that occurred earlier in the year and reduced demand for fixed-rate loans. From June to August, the latest month for which there are data, a little under 10 per cent of new <span class=\"no-wrap\">owner-occupier</span> housing loans were taken out at fixed rates, down from a peak of nearly 15 per cent in March this year. More recently, lenders' funding costs for fixed-rate loans have increased in line with the rise in bond yields. As is usual, small business fixed rates have followed these movements fairly closely, rising <span class=\"no-wrap\">by 30 basis points</span> since the end of August, to be at their highest levels since early 2005. ", " After reaching successive record highs in August and September, domestic share prices fell sharply in the <span class=\"no-wrap\">first part of October</span>. The ASX 200 has recorded a net decline of 5 per cent since its peak on 29 September, leaving the sharemarket a little higher than at the time of the previous <em>Statement</em> (Graph 54). The net fall in the ASX 200 since late September has been sharper than that in overseas equity markets, in large part because the share prices of resource companies, which have a relatively large weight in the Australian index, have fallen by around 8 per cent. Nonetheless, resource companies' share prices are still more than 30 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year (Graph 55). ", " The Australian sharemarket as a whole is around 10 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year and <span class=\"no-wrap\">65 per cent</span> higher than its low in March 2003. Broadly speaking, these price increases have been well supported by increases in company earnings: the market's current valuation, as measured by the aggregate P/E ratio based on historical earnings, is a bit below its average for the past decade, and around its average for much longer periods of time. The aggregate P/E ratio for global equity markets (excluding Australia) is well below its average for the past decade. This reflects a correction to the run-up in global sharemarkets in the second half of the 90s, at a time when earnings per share were quite flat (Graph 56). In short, the convergence of Australian and global P/E ratios largely reflects a downward correction in overseas markets over the past five years rather than the Australian market having become overly expensive. ", " The forward P/E ratio – which is based on analysts' earnings estimates for the next 12 months – and the dividend yield are also around their 10-year averages. ", " Total credit growth has remained in a relatively tight range since early 2004, albeit with some tentative evidence of slowing in recent months, and stood at an annualised rate of 13.2 per cent in the six months to September (Table 11 and <span class=\"no-wrap\">Graph 57)</span>. The gradual moderation in household credit growth over the past 18 months has been offset by a tendency towards stronger growth in business credit. ", " Household credit grew at an annualised rate of 11.9 per cent in the six months to September, below the average growth rate seen over the past decade and almost 10 percentage points lower than the peak rate at the <span class=\"no-wrap\">end of 2003</span>. While this moderation largely reflected the softening in housing credit growth, especially in lending to investors, growth in personal credit has also slowed from the high rates recorded around the turn of the year. ", " Within personal credit, growth in margin lending for the purchase of shares and managed funds moderated a little in the September quarter but was still strong, consistent with the strength in the share market over that period <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 58)</span>. Growth over the year, at 30 per cent, remained around the fastest annual pace since early 2002. Against the trend of the past year, growth in margin debt in the September quarter was mainly due to an increase in the average loan size, to $126,000, with the number of borrowers remaining broadly unchanged. ", " The majority of new margin loans taken out in the September quarter were at variable interest rates, with the fixed-rate share falling to a more normal level of 20 per cent from 60 per cent in the June quarter. (The higher share of fixed-rate loans in the June quarter was mainly due to investors pre-paying their interest to bring forward tax deductions.) The average frequency of margin calls in the September quarter was little changed from its historically low level, reflecting the absence of significant price falls during the quarter and relatively low gearing levels. The latter, together with the relatively low percentage of credit limits being used, suggest that, on average, investors are taking a more conservative approach to their margin borrowing than in the past. ", " Growth in business credit has remained strong, at an annualised rate of 15.5 per cent in the six months to September. Contributing to this has been the strength in syndicated loan approvals, which totalled $37 billion in the period, compared with $28 billion in the previous six months (Graph 59). By value, around a third of the syndicated loan approvals in the six months to September were used for merger and acquisition activities and another third were used for general corporate purposes. ", " On the liability side of intermediaries' balance sheets, the growth rate of broad money has moderated a little in recent months, to an annualised rate of 9.3 per cent over the six months to September. The continued positive gap between the rates of growth of total credit and broad money predominantly reflects intermediaries' increased reliance on funding sources not included in broad money, such as bonds and asset-backed securities. ", " Following record issuance of $50 billion by Australian non-government entities in the June quarter, gross bond issuance in the September quarter was more subdued, at just under $40 billion (Table 12). This moderation was mainly due to a decline in financial and non-financial corporates' issuance into offshore markets. Issuance into the domestic market by these entities, as well as by asset-backed vehicles, remained strong, with almost $20 billion raised in the latest quarter. The recent strength of issuance by non-residents into the domestic market has also been maintained, with $9 billion raised in the September quarter. A noteworthy trend within this has been an increased number of large deals ($1 billion and over) being offered by single issuers, mainly large banks, which have been comfortably absorbed by the domestic market. ", " Net equity raisings for the September quarter totalled around $4 billion, slightly below the <span class=\"no-wrap\">post-2001</span> average (Graph 60). The bulk of raisings were by financials companies. IPOs were dominated by firms within the real estate or diversified financials industries. Other equity raisings were dominated by dividend reinvestment plans, again mainly among financials companies. ", " Despite the strength of the sharemarket this year, non-financials' equity raisings have been modest. But, as noted in the chapter on ‘<a href=\"#domestic-economic-conditions\">Domestic Economic Conditions</a>’, these businesses remain well funded in total. ", " The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.9 per cent in the September quarter, to be 3.0 per cent higher over the year (Graph 61, Table 13). Based on a range of underlying inflation measures, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation was around 2½ per cent over the year to the September quarter. A significant factor explaining the difference between CPI and underlying inflation was the effect of petrol prices, which rose <span class=\"no-wrap\">by 11.6 per cent</span> in the September quarter and by almost 20 per cent over the year, reflecting movements in world oil prices. (See ‘<a href=\"#box-c\">Box C: Oil Usage in the Australian Economy</a>’ for details of expenditure on oil by both households and businesses.) ", " Ongoing strength in house purchase costs also made a significant contribution to CPI inflation in the September quarter, as did price rises for domestic holiday travel &amp; accommodation, and property rates &amp; charges. These increases were offset to some extent by a seasonal fall in the price of pharmaceuticals and a fall in the price of a new component of the CPI – deposit &amp; loan facilities – which appeared to be partly the result of the removal of state debits taxes. The introduction of the deposit &amp; loan facilities price series, and a number of other changes to the CPI, are discussed in ‘<a href=\"#box-d\">Box D: The Introduction of the 15th Series Consumer Price Index</a>’. ", " The gap between tradables and non-tradables price inflation has continued to narrow. The price of tradables rose by 1.2 per cent in the quarter, driven by increases in the prices of petrol and food. Excluding these items the increase in tradables prices was modest, but the year-ended rate became positive for the first time in nearly two years, as the disinflationary effects of the appreciation of the exchange rate in 2002 and 2003 have now largely passed (Graph 62). The price of non-tradables rose by 0.8 per cent in the quarter to be 3.4 per cent higher than a year ago; the year-ended rate has eased from the high rates prevailing in early 2004, mainly reflecting some moderation in the growth of housing costs. ", " Producer price data indicate that upstream inflation pressures remained firm over the year to the September quarter <span class=\"no-wrap\">(Graph 63, Table 14)</span>. The direct effects of high world oil prices continued to make a significant contribution to growth in producer prices, but even excluding these effects, there were sizeable increases in prices at all stages of production. ", " Prices at the final stage of production increased by 1.5 per cent in the September quarter, to be 3.4 per cent higher over the year. Aside from the higher price of oil, building construction costs again made the largest contribution to the quarterly rise, partly reflecting the rising cost of labour input. Price falls were recorded for a smaller number of goods than in the June quarter, and their dampening effect on overall price movements was less. In particular, the prices of imported equipment, which had previously fallen and reduced pressure on prices at the final stage of production, rose in the September quarter. ", " Most measures of aggregate wage growth indicate that wage pressures picked up a little and became more broadly based in the first half of 2005. These outcomes are consistent with the ongoing strength in the labour market and with information obtained through the Bank's business liaison program. ", " The Wage Price Index (WPI) provided the clearest indication of a pick-up in wage pressures, growing by <span class=\"no-wrap\">1.1 per cent</span> in the June quarter, to be 4.0 per cent higher over the year (Graph 64). While the average annualised wage increase (AAWI) for federal enterprise agreements certified in the June quarter fell to 3.8 per cent, this appeared to have been held down by changes in the industry composition of agreements. Agreements renegotiated in the quarter delivered higher wage outcomes than those they replaced, and the AAWI for all current federal agreements was unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Other official labour cost data, such as average weekly ordinary-time earnings and average earnings from the national accounts, indicated that firm wage growth continued in the June quarter. In addition, the NAB quarterly business survey reported that there was a slight pick-up in the year-ended growth of actual labour costs in the September quarter. ", " On balance, aggregate data suggest that wage pressures remain stronger in the public than the private sector. Within the private sector, the WPI indicates that the construction and mining industries continue to experience significant wage pressures, consistent with the strength of demand in these sectors. However, according to liaison, wage pressures are also pronounced in the business services sector and are becoming more broad-based across industries. ", " Business surveys continue to show that firms have been experiencing difficulty finding suitable labour (Graph 65). In addition, the Bank's liaison with firms indicates that there has been a widespread increase in rates of staff turnover. Consequently, firms are more actively using non-wage remuneration – such as bonus payments, more flexible work arrangements and more generous leave provisions – to attract and retain employees. They are also increasing the frequency of their salary reviews and rates of promotion. In this climate of labour shortages and increased staff turnover, firms are reporting an increase in staff training costs. ", " Unit labour costs, which measure total labour costs per unit of output, are estimated to have grown by <span class=\"no-wrap\">0.6 per cent</span> in the June quarter to be 4.2 per cent higher over the year. Although wage growth has been firm, the strength in unit labour costs mostly reflects a fall in estimated labour productivity over the year to June, which has been more pronounced than the typical cyclical slowdown. ", " Business surveys suggest that both near-term inflationary pressures and expectations of future price growth currently remain contained, though the persistence of high oil prices raises the risk that these expectations could become dislodged. Both the ACCI-Westpac survey of manufacturers and the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey reported a fall in the net balance of firms increasing selling prices in the September quarter and expecting to increase prices over the coming months. The NAB survey reported that, in aggregate, final product price inflation fell slightly in the September quarter, although there was a pick-up in retail price inflation. Both economy-wide and retail price inflation were expected to remain broadly steady in the December quarter. ", " The Bank's survey of market economists, conducted following the release of the September quarter CPI, indicates that the median forecast for CPI inflation over the year to June 2006 increased to 3 per cent (Table 15). The median expectation over the year to June 2007 remains unchanged at 2½ per cent. Union officials expect inflation to be somewhat higher; the median expectation is for year-ended inflation to rise to just under <span class=\"no-wrap\">3½ per cent</span> by June 2006 and then to stabilise around this level. ", " The median inflation expectation of consumers, as reported in the Melbourne Institute survey, was 5.2 per cent in October. While this series is now well above its average over the past five years, it has shown little correlation with either current or future inflation in recent years. The medium-term inflation expectations of financial market participants, which are calculated as the difference between nominal and indexed bond yields, have edged slightly higher since the last <cite>Statement on Monetary Policy</cite>, averaging 2.8 per cent over the past three months. ", " The CPI increase of 3 per cent over the year to the September quarter was noticeably higher than outcomes in recent quarters, and owed largely to the sharp rise in petrol prices. Nonetheless, higher fuel prices and rising input costs have so far had only limited effects on general price inflation at the consumer level. That is, to the extent that they are forcing up some prices in the economy, it appears that these increases have not been passed on to consumers or they have been offset by slower rises or declines in other prices. Overall, based on a range of indicators, the Bank's assessment is that underlying inflation has remained well contained at around 2½ per cent over the past year. Indeed, quarterly underlying inflation outcomes have been remarkably stable for about the past two years. However, wage data for the first half of 2005 suggest that the strength in the labour market has resulted in a pick-up in wage pressures at an aggregate level. ", " The Bank's forecast for inflation is based on the assumption that oil prices remain around the late-October average level of US$62 per barrel. The forecasts envisage solid growth in domestic production (GDP growth of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3–3½ per cent</span> over the forecast period) and a slowing in the growth in domestic expenditure towards that of production. Given this background, underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually over the year ahead, reflecting the current upward drift in the growth of labour costs. There will also be a greater contribution from import prices owing to stronger global inflation for raw materials and the waning of the effects of the <span class=\"no-wrap\">2002–2003</span> currency appreciation. However, the effect of these pressures on inflation is expected to be more muted than might otherwise have been the case, given the moderation in domestic demand growth, the prospect of a mild easing in labour market conditions, and the scope for firms to absorb some portion of rising costs in margins (which remain reasonably healthy both in aggregate and in some key sectors). Based on these factors, underlying inflation is expected to increase to around 3 per cent by mid 2006, but not to rise beyond this level in the medium term. Higher petrol prices will keep headline CPI inflation above underlying inflation for the next few quarters, but assuming no further rises in petrol prices, the two inflation measures would be expected to converge from late 2006. ", " One risk to the inflation outlook is that there could be no easing in labour market conditions, and hence further upward pressure on wages and other labour costs. Oil prices present another risk, given the prominence of petrol prices for households, and their potential to raise consumers' inflation expectations. Increases in transport costs and prices of petroleum-derived products could also flow through into wider second-round price increases by firms. These risks would increase if oil prices were to rise above current levels. But, as highlighted in the <a href=\"#box-c\">Box on oil usage</a>, with oil expenditures representing only 2½ to 3 per cent of GDP, the current oil price increase is a much smaller cost shock to the Australian economy than was the case in the late 1970s. Furthermore, risks to the inflation outlook are tempered by the experience of the past decade or so, which suggests that expectations about low inflation have become well entrenched in the broader community, and that markets for many goods and services are subject to a higher level of competition from both domestic and external sources. ", " Benchmark oil prices have more than doubled over the past two years, and have risen by around <span class=\"no-wrap\">40 per cent</span> since the end of 2004. Disruptions to extraction and refining facilities resulting from hurricanes in the US Gulf Coast region led to a spike in prices in late August and early September, with prices briefly exceeding US$70 before retracing to around US$60 by early November. ", " Aside from the hurricane-related volatility, the significant increase in oil prices over recent years has generally been viewed as driven by strong global demand, rather than restraints on supply. Between late 2003, when prices began rising sharply, and July this year (the latest period for which world oil supply data are available) world oil production rose by 6.0 per cent, or 4.1 million barrels per day (bpd) (Graph A1). OPEC producers accounted for 3.3 million bpd of this increase, boosting their production by 12 per cent over this period. Despite this supply expansion, benchmark oil prices roughly doubled in US$ terms over the same period. ", " These developments contrast with those in earlier episodes, such as the OPEC oil shocks of the 1970s, when supply declined and the increase in prices was substantially larger and more sudden. Over the period September to November 1973, OPEC nations cut production by around 12 per cent, reducing overall world supply by about 7 per cent (Graph A2). Similarly, OPEC oil supply fell by around 9 per cent over the period October 1978 to February 1979, leading to a decline in total supply of 4 per cent. Subsequent sharp increases in prices, such as that seen in late 1990 prior to the first Gulf War, were also associated with falls in production. ", " An additional perspective on the current shock is provided by developments in futures prices for oil. Over the past decade or so, swings in spot oil prices have typically been viewed as temporary, so longer-term futures prices normally reacted little to them. In contrast, the strength in demand that has recently driven prices higher is generally expected to be sustained, especially given that more than one-third of the increase in demand has come from China and other fast-growing parts of Asia. Six-year futures prices have therefore risen sharply, from US$37 per barrel in late 2004 to US$55 in early November. Futures prices are now around 110 per cent higher than at the end of 2003, similar to the increase in spot prices. ", " Fund managers are one of the main categories of investors in the Australian bond market. These institutions hold roughly a quarter of bonds outstanding in Australia, that is, around $70 billion. Insurance companies and offshore investors each hold a similar share, while banks and other deposit-taking institutions hold a further sixth of outstandings. This box examines how fund managers have allocated their bond portfolios over recent years.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " The composition of fund managers' domestic bond portfolios was relatively stable over the course of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2002 and 2003;</span> there was a small increase in the allocation to non-government bonds – mainly at the expense of cash – and there was some switching between Commonwealth and state government debt. In early 2004 these institutions reduced their allocations to Commonwealth securities and switched to nongovernment bonds (in the face of strong demand from offshore institutions for Commonwealth securities) (Graph B1). ", " Over the past year, as spreads between non-government bonds and government bonds narrowed, fund managers have steadily rebalanced their portfolios towards Commonwealth Government bonds and away from non-government bonds. Growth in funds under management has meant that fund managers have still been net buyers of non-government bonds over this period, but to a lesser extent than banks and non-residents. ", " Consistent with this development, fund managers have also been progressively rebalancing their non-government portfolios towards bonds with higher credit ratings (Graph B2). During the second half of 2004, fund managers reduced their exposures to BBB-rated and sub-investment grade debt, and increased their exposure to A-rated debt. In 2005, they continued to reduce their exposure to BBB-rated and sub-investment grade debt, and switched out of A-rated debt and into AA-rated debt, as the relative pick-up on A-rated debt continued to decline. Over the whole period, AAA-rated bonds have typically comprised about half of bond managers' non-government bond portfolios. Residential mortgage-backed securities have likely accounted for the bulk of these bonds. ", " Market commentary has suggested that fund managers' decision to reduce the credit risk in their bond portfolios did not reflect concerns that default rates would increase noticeably in coming months – corporate earnings remain strong, debt levels are low, and upgrades continue to outpace downgrades. Instead, it appears that fund managers have taken the view that high levels of global liquidity have depressed spreads to levels that no longer adequately compensate investors for the risk that they are accepting, even if that risk is not very high. ", " In addition to credit risk, fund managers are concerned with interest rate risk – the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the value of their bond holdings. From mid 2003 to mid 2005, fund managers reduced the duration of their bond portfolios relative to their benchmark (which in most cases is the UBS Composite Index) (Graph B3). This broadly coincided with the inversion of the Australian yield curve, and probably reflected a view amongst fund managers that longer-dated bonds were expensive given the likely stance of monetary policy over coming years. Since August, bond yields have risen (prices fallen) and fund managers have lengthened their duration. ", " Average capital city petrol prices rose from around $1.00 per litre to $1.19 per litre over the year to the September quarter, as a result of a sharp run-up in global crude oil prices. Increases in petrol prices have a direct impact on the CPI and boosted the annual inflation rate significantly in the September quarter. This Box provides some further discussion of the impact of higher oil prices on the Australian economy, focusing on oil usage. Overall, the data suggest that the recent strength in oil prices should represent less of a shock to the aggregate price level than some earlier global oil shocks. ", " While the sharp increase in petrol prices has attracted a lot of attention, petrol accounts for a relatively modest share of spending by Australian households. Automotive fuel has a base-period weight of <span class=\"no-wrap\">3.8 per cent</span> in the new 15th series of the CPI. In the broader national accounts measure of household consumption expenditure, automotive fuel accounted for a little less than 3 per cent of total household spending in 2004/05. The household expenditure survey (HES) suggests there are only modest differences in the share of petrol in consumption across different income levels. ", " With an average weekly petrol consumption of around 35 litres per household, the price increase of nearly 20 cents per litre over the year to the September quarter would have added nearly $7 to the average weekly household fuel bill (taking it to about $42 per week), assuming no change in the volume of petrol purchased.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> However, one response of households to higher prices has apparently been to look for ways to reduce their fuel consumption, such as cutting back on discretionary driving or changing to more fuel-efficient vehicles. The June quarter national accounts point to some reduction in the amount of fuel consumed by households in recent quarters, and sales of small cars have picked up significantly recently.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> ", " Households are not the only consumers of petrol: petrol and other oil-derived products are also used by businesses as inputs into the production process. In addition, part of the amount spent by users on fuel represents taxes, which are a transfer within the economy. The broadest measure of the importance of oil in the economy is the ratio of total oil usage to GDP. For the economy as a whole, the importance of oil has steadily declined over the past 25 years as firms and households have become more efficient users of oil, largely in response to rises in oil prices in the late 1970s, reflecting the introduction of import parity pricing and the subsequent second OPEC oil shock. In addition, energy-intensive sectors now make up a smaller share of the economy as the services sector has expanded. As a consequence, oil intensity, defined as the number of barrels of oil consumed per unit of real GDP, is now around 40 per cent lower than at the end of the 1970s (Graph C1). Expenditure on oil consumption has fallen from a short-lived peak of 5–6 per cent of GDP around 1980 to 2–2½ per cent in recent years (Graph C2).<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"r4\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 3\">[3]</a></sup> If oil prices were to remain at current levels with no change in oil consumption, this ratio would rise to around 3 per cent in 2005/06. This represents a substantially smaller cost shock to the Australian economy than occurred in the late 1970s. ", " The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) regularly reviews the content of the CPI so that it accurately reflects the prices of goods and services acquired by households. In the September quarter 2005, it introduced the 15th series of the CPI. This series contains several significant changes. In particular, the weights on all the expenditure components of the CPI have been updated in line with the 2003/04 Household Expenditure Survey, financial services prices have been included for the first time, and prices for personal computers are now directly estimated.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"r5\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 1\">[1]</a></sup> ", " The update to the CPI weighting scheme is standard practice for the ABS every five years or so. The weights are updated with a view to accounting for such things as the introduction of new goods and services and minimising the substitution bias inherent in a price index like the CPI. This bias arises because the CPI is constructed for a fixed basket of goods and services and does not allow for the fact that consumers are likely to change the bundle of products they purchase between weighting periods, increasing their purchases of products for which relative prices have fallen, and reducing their purchases of products for which relative prices have risen. Graph D1 compares the base-period weights for the 10 expenditure groups (excluding the new Financial &amp; Insurance Services group) with those in the previous series of the CPI, which were based on household expenditure in 1998/99. There has been an increase in the expenditure shares for housing, communication, health, education and recreation since the introduction of the 14th series CPI in 2000. In contrast, there has been a fall in the expenditure shares for transportation, food, clothing &amp; footwear, household contents &amp; services, and alcohol &amp; tobacco. ", " While the quantity of each product within the CPI basket remains constant until the next re-weighting of the CPI, relative price movements can cause changes in the <em>effective</em> weights of goods and services in the calculation of the CPI. For example, petrol prices rose more quickly than the overall CPI between the <span class=\"no-wrap\">June quarter</span> 2000 and the June quarter 2005. The increase in the relative price of petrol implies that the effective weight on automotive fuel increased over the period of the 14th series CPI. Therefore, the change in effective weights between the June quarter and the September quarter 2005 were in some cases quite different to the change in the base-period weights. The most significant increases in effective weights have been for audio visual &amp; computing equipment, telecommunication, and motor vehicles (Graph D2). In contrast, the most significant decreases have been for automotive fuel, beer, and takeaway meals &amp; fast foods. The effective weight of automotive fuel has fallen from 4.6 per cent in the June quarter to <span class=\"no-wrap\">4.1 per cent</span> in the September quarter (abstracting from the effect on weights of introducing financial services in the 15th series); including financial services, it has fallen from 4.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent. According to the ABS, the fall in this weight partly reflects reduced usage of petrol due to improvements in the fuel efficiency of passenger vehicles. ", " The other significant development in moving to the 15th series of the CPI is the inclusion of the new <em>financial services price index</em> (FSPI), which measures the cost of services consumed by households due to the acquisition, holding and disposal of financial and real assets. The FSPI comprises two component indices. The <em>deposit &amp; loan facilities price index</em>, which has been given a base-period weight of 4.5 per cent in the CPI, covers facilities provided to households by deposit-taking institutions. It is designed to measure both the direct fees and indirect costs for households engaged in borrowing and lending transactions. The <em>other                                          financial services price index</em>, which has a base-period weight of 3.3 per cent in the CPI, aims to measure the price of services provided by stockbrokers and real-estate agencies when households transact in shares and property, plus any government charges on property transfers such as stamp duties. ", " The indirect cost component of the deposit &amp; loan facilities price index is measured by ‘interest <span class=\"no-wrap\">rate margins’ – the difference</span> between lending and deposit rates faced by households. For example, if lending rates were to increase relative to deposit rates, this would increase the implicit ‘price’ of financial services for households.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"r6\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 2\">[2]</a></sup> As financial institutions tend to adjust their lending rates more quickly than their deposit rates in response to changes in the cash rate, interest rate margins (and hence the deposit &amp; loan facilities price index) will, to some extent, be correlated with movements in the cash rate.<sup class=\"footnote-reference\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"r7\" aria-label=\"Go to footnote 3\">[3]</a></sup> ", " While financial services prices have not previously appeared in the CPI, the ABS has recently made available experimental data for the FSPI and its two component price indices dating back to 1998. These data suggest that the FSPI rose by 2.6 per cent over the year to the September quarter, slightly slower than the headline inflation rate (Graph D3). These data also indicate that movements in the FSPI have been significantly less volatile than price changes for items, such as fruit &amp; vegetables and automotive fuel, that are frequently excluded from measures of underlying inflation. ", " The price series for deposit &amp; loan facilities differs in important ways from the mortgage interest charges component that formed part of the CPI between 1987 and 1998. That item was generally thought to distort the signal about inflationary pressure provided by the CPI. The mortgage interest charges component of the CPI included a gross interest rate, rather than an interest rate margin, which is the case for the new deposit &amp; loan facilities series. Consequently, when interest rates were raised to combat inflationary pressures, the mortgage interest component of the CPI would rise correspondingly, adding to inflation as measured by the total CPI. Given the larger movements in interest rates in that period, that component was one of the most volatile CPI components, with the volatility of quarterly price changes around three times the median volatility of other CPI components. Furthermore, mortgage interest charges accounted for a larger share of the CPI than does the new deposit &amp; loan facilities component. ", " The other important change introduced in the 15th series CPI is the pricing methodology for personal computers. In general, price indices, such as the CPI, should measure ‘pure’ price changes – that is, changes that adjust for the characteristics or quality of individual goods. However, quality adjustments for goods which experience rapid changes in quality, such as computers, are difficult. The international ‘best practice’ has been to develop hedonic price indices that relate changes in a product's price to changes in its underlying characteristics; for example, a computer's processing speed, memory and hard drive space. Until now, the ABS' approach to pricing computers has been to adopt the hedonic price index calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US as a proxy price measure for computers in Australia (after adjusting for factors such as exchange rate movements). From the 15th series onwards, the ABS will instead adopt its own hedonic pricing model. "], "URL": "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2005/nov/1.html"}
