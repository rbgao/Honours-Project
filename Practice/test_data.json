{"Date": ["Sydney – 3 March 2020"], "Text": {"Members Present": ["Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Wendy Craik AM, Ian Harper, Steven Kennedy PSM, Allan Moss AO, Carol Schwartz AO, Catherine Tanna"], "Others Present": ["Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Andrea Brischetto (Deputy Head, Domestic Markets Department)", "Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Ellis Connolly (Deputy Secretary), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Bradley Jones (Head, International Department), Marion Kohler (Head, Domestic Markets Department)"], "Financial Markets": ["Members commenced their discussion by noting that, since the previous meeting, it had become increasingly clear that the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) beyond China would cause a major disruption to economic activity around the world. Many countries were imposing travel restrictions and businesses and individuals were electing not to travel. COVID-19 had also been creating considerable uncertainty worldwide, leading to a significant reduction in risk appetites. This uncertainty meant that there was an increasing probability that people would seek to avoid gatherings, including public transport and perhaps workplaces.", "These developments were evident in the significant changes in global financial markets outside of China in recent weeks. There had been sharp falls in the prices of risky assets and markets were finding it difficult to price the risks, given their unprecedented nature.", "In the advanced economies, equity markets had declined sharply from recent highs, with sectors most exposed to COVID-19 disruptions experiencing particularly large falls. Spreads in corporate bond and money markets had widened, including in Australia, and issuance of corporate debt had slowed in late February after a strong start to the year. However, members noted that while spreads had widened, corporate borrowing costs had not risen much, if at all, because sovereign bond yields had declined to very low levels. In a number of countries, including Australia, sovereign bond yields were at record lows. On the whole, international financial markets were functioning effectively despite the sharp rise in volatility.", "Members then turned to a discussion of international policy responses. Following the sharp adjustment to Chinese asset prices after the extended Lunar New Year break, the authorities in China had introduced a range of measures to forestall a tightening in financial conditions. This included monetary and fiscal easing targeted at supporting smaller firms in particular, with policymakers also indicating a willingness to ease policies. These measures had underpinned a stabilisation of onshore equity and credit markets. Elsewhere in the region, some central banks had also eased monetary policy, and modest fiscal measures were being deployed in some countries. Financial market volatility in the region had increased, but conditions had remained orderly.", "Central banks in the major advanced economies had acknowledged the uncertainty created by the outbreak of COVID-19. Some had signalled a preparedness to provide further monetary policy accommodation if conditions warranted. Market pricing had moved substantially, suggesting that central banks in the advanced economies were expected to ease monetary policy at upcoming policy meetings. The expectation that central banks in the advanced economies would soon respond with easier policy had contributed to yields on long-term sovereign debt declining to historic lows in many markets.", "In foreign exchange markets, the Japanese yen had appreciated as concerns about COVID-19 intensified. Members also noted that the US dollar had appreciated in recent months against most currencies. Regionally, the renminbi had been little changed and exchange rates in emerging Asia had depreciated somewhat, but in the context of broader US dollar strength. Members observed that the Australian dollar was at its lowest level in more than a decade.", "Domestically, members noted that issuance of bank debt had slowed recently, but this partly reflected the substantial volume of funding already to hand and the modest growth in bank credit. Bank funding costs had declined a little over the prior month, with a modest widening in spreads more than offset by sharp declines in risk-free rates. The reductions in the cash rate in the previous year had brought bank funding costs to historic lows, with retail deposit rates having fallen further in recent months.", "Lending rates were also at historic lows. While standard variable mortgage rates had declined by around 60 basis points since mid 2019, the average rate paid on outstanding variable-rate mortgages had drifted down by an additional 10 basis points beyond that. Members noted that, if the downward drift in average rates paid continued at its recent pace, there would be full pass-through of the previous year's reductions in the cash rate to the average mortgage rate by mid 2020.", "Members discussed the factors contributing to this downward drift in average mortgage rates. In particular, ongoing strong competition for new high-quality borrowers had seen new and refinancing borrowers receive lower interest rates than those paid by existing borrowers. Improving transparency would help address this. Some borrowers were also switching from interest-only loans to principal-and-interest loans, which had lower interest rates.", "Members observed that the growth in housing credit for owner-occupiers had increased a little over the previous six months or so, but housing credit was growing more slowly than housing loan commitments, consistent with a rise in mortgage payments over this period. Loan commitments to investors had increased modestly over the same period, while housing credit for investors had stopped declining recently.", "Market pricing suggested that market participants expected the cash rate target to be cut by 25 basis points at the present meeting, and again by June."], "International Economic Conditions": ["Members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that the spread of COVID-19 was expected to affect global growth in 2020 by more than had been factored into the forecasts presented at the previous meeting.", "Actions taken by Chinese authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19 had severely restricted economic activity in China in the March quarter and there continued to be significant uncertainty about the size and persistence of this disruption. While industrial output was typically lower in the March quarter because of the Lunar New Year holiday period, production had remained at holiday levels for much longer than usual. Coal consumption by power plants had also remained around the low levels typical of the Lunar New Year period. Members noted that this had not reduced demand for coal imports, which suggested that there had been a significant decline in China's domestic coal production. Iron ore imports also had not been significantly affected. Business conditions in China in February had deteriorated by much more than expected and supplier delivery times had increased sharply, indicating that there had also been disruptions to supply chains. Retail activity and residential property sales had been subdued.", "Chinese GDP was expected to rebound later in 2020 as businesses seek to make up lost production and a range of stimulus and tax relief measures from the Chinese Government take effect. Some government measures, including direct support for manufacturers of medical equipment, were intended to support containment efforts, while others, such as assistance to affected small businesses, were designed to reduce the adverse economic spillovers from COVID-19.", "Given the disruptions to logistics and other transportation in China, forecasts for global oil demand had been scaled back considerably and oil prices had fallen. This would lead to a decline in headline inflation globally. The prices of other commodities that tend to be responsive to changes in the outlook for global demand, including base metals, had also fallen since the start of 2020. Prices for liquefied natural gas had also declined. Prices of other bulk commodities had been little changed in net terms; iron ore prices had reversed an earlier fall, even as Chinese steel inventories had increased, possibly in anticipation of a pick-up in demand as economic activity rebounded.", "Growth in other Asian economies was also expected to be lower in the March quarter than previously thought, reflecting a combination of lower Chinese domestic demand, less Chinese outbound travel and supply chain disruptions. Early indicators of trade activity in the Asian region in February had declined, following a period where trade, industrial production and manufacturing indicators in the more export-oriented economies had stabilised, amid signs of stabilisation in the global electronics cycle. Overall, growth in Australia's major trading partners was expected to be around ½ percentage point lower in 2020 as a result of COVID-19.", "In the major advanced economies, GDP data for the December quarter had been weaker than expected for Japan and the euro area, while GDP growth in the United States had been relatively resilient. Even though employment growth had eased over 2019 in the major advanced economies, unemployment rates had continued to edge lower. Prior to any supply disruptions related to COVID-19, industrial production in the euro area had continued to decline, particularly in the auto sector. Members noted that, to date, there had been no reports that supply disruptions were contributing to these declines. Some survey measures of business conditions in the United States and Japan had deteriorated sharply in February, but investment intentions and business sentiment in the United States had been more positive."], "Domestic Economic Conditions": ["Members noted that the December quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. Quarterly GDP growth was expected to have remained moderate, reflecting ongoing weak growth in household consumption and a further decline in dwelling investment. The bushfires over the summer months were expected to have affected growth in both the December quarter 2019 and the March quarter 2020, after which recovery efforts were expected to boost growth.", "Members noted that economic activity in the first half of 2020 would be significantly affected by the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Services exports (which comprise around 5 per cent of GDP) were expected to decline by around 10 per cent in the March quarter, mainly because of a steep decline in inbound arrivals, including students, particularly from China. This effect alone was expected to lower Australian GDP growth by around ½ percentage point in the March quarter. Tourism and education exports were expected to remain low in the June quarter, before returning to their previous levels over the second half of the year as the Chinese economy recovers and travel resumes. Members observed that this estimate did not include possible effects on domestic activity of supply chain disruptions and public health safety interventions to reduce the likelihood of transmitting COVID-19.", "Information from the capital expenditure (capex) survey and preliminary data on non-residential construction work done suggested that both non-mining and mining investment had decreased in the December quarter, led by weakness in building and engineering investment. However, mining firms had continued to expect solid growth in investment over the rest of <span class=\"no-wrap\">2019/20</span>. The capex survey had also reported firms' investment intentions for <span class=\"no-wrap\">2020/21</span> for the first time. The responses suggested that mining investment would increase strongly, consistent with the most recent set of forecasts and the messages from liaison with businesses, while non-mining investment was expected to remain subdued.", "National housing price growth had remained robust in February and most capital cities had experienced at least moderate price increases. The strong growth in housing prices had also encouraged more new residential listings, albeit from very low levels. Turnover had increased, which, by itself, was expected to help support other types of spending. Indicators of activity at the earlier stages of residential building had remained consistent with a turnaround in activity in the second half of 2020, especially for detached dwellings. However, data on residential building work done indicated dwelling investment had decreased again in the December quarter, driven by a further decline in the construction of new dwellings.", "Growth in household consumption was expected to have been subdued in the December quarter; retail sales volumes had increased modestly and there had been further declines in motor vehicle sales in the quarter. A few categories of spending that are most correlated with housing activity had picked up in the quarter. The drought had continued to affect food prices and the volume of food sales had declined in the quarter. Members noted that growth in consumption in the first quarter of 2020 could be weaker than expected if the COVID-19 outbreak induced some households to cancel or defer international travel or disrupted supply chains for imported consumer durables. Although there was considerable uncertainty about the size of the net effect on GDP, it was expected to be small based on the available evidence.", "Employment had grown by 1.9 per cent over the year to January, which was stronger than growth in the working-age population. However, the unemployment rate had increased to 5.3 per cent, reversing the small decline in the previous month, and the underemployment rate had increased to 8.6 per cent. The unemployment rate had been around 5¼ per cent for most of the preceding year. Members noted that the labour force data could be volatile from month to month and that it was too soon to know if the modest rise in these measures of spare capacity signalled a change in trend. The wage price index confirmed that growth in wages had remained steady at low rates in the December quarter, consistent with information from liaison with businesses, which suggested that wage outcomes had become increasingly concentrated in the 2–3 per cent range. Wages growth had slowed a little in some industries. These data and reports from liaison with businesses suggested that wages growth was unlikely to pick up in the near future."], "Considerations for Monetary Policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that it was becoming increasingly clear that COVID-19 would cause major disruption to economic activity around the world. The outbreak had occurred in the context of a global economy that was gradually emerging from a soft patch in trade and manufacturing activity. However, following the outbreak, growth in output in China and other economies was expected to be significantly lower in the first half of the year, reflecting a combination of lower domestic demand, less travel and supply chain disruptions. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 outside of China, and intensified efforts to contain its further spread, raised the prospect of a broader and more extended disruption to the global economy. It was too early to tell how persistent these effects would be and at what point economic activity would rebound. In response to the outbreak, policy measures to support growth had been announced in several countries, including China. Inflation remained subdued in most advanced economies, despite low unemployment rates.", "Financial markets had been more volatile as market participants assessed the implications of COVID-19, with the prices of many risky assets falling sharply. The uncertainty generated by the outbreak, and an expectation that central banks would respond with easier policy, had resulted in long-term government bond yields falling to historic lows in many countries, including Australia. The Australian dollar had depreciated to be at its lowest level in more than a decade. Australia's financial markets were operating effectively, and the Bank would continue to ensure that the Australian financial system had sufficient liquidity.", "The advent of COVID-19 around the world was having a significant effect on the Australian economy, particularly in the education, transport and tourism sectors. The uncertainty associated with the outbreak was also likely to affect household spending and business investment in coming months. As a result, GDP growth in the March quarter was likely to be noticeably weaker than previously expected, and it was difficult to predict how long it would take for the economy to return to more usual levels of activity. Once the disruptions passed, GDP growth was expected to pick up, supported by the low level of interest rates, high levels of spending on infrastructure, the lower exchange rate, stronger investment in the resources sector and recoveries in residential construction and household consumption. The Australian Government had also indicated that it would assist areas of the economy most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Given these developments, members considered how best to respond, noting that even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, progress towards full employment and the inflation target had been expected to be only gradual. The COVID-19 outbreak was expected to delay that progress further.", "In discussing a possible monetary policy response, members welcomed indications from the Australian Government that fiscal measures would be taken to support investment, the cash flow of affected businesses and jobs. They also discussed the support that lower interest rates would provide to jobs and economic activity through a lower exchange rate and a boost to aggregate cash flows for households and businesses. Members recognised that the combined monetary and fiscal responses would help the economy deal with the challenges posed by COVID-19.", "As part of their deliberations, members considered a number of scenarios, including one where the COVID-19 outbreak would be contained in the very near future and where there would be a rapid recovery in economic activity. In that scenario, the maximum effect of any additional monetary policy stimulus would be felt in the recovery phase, rather than in the short term, when policy support would most be needed. However, this scenario was considered very unlikely, with the more realistic scenario being that the outbreak would have a significant effect on the Australian economy.", "Members also discussed the risk that a further reduction in interest rates could encourage additional borrowing at a time when there was already a strong upswing in the housing market. In the current context of heightened uncertainty, that risk was not viewed as particularly high relative to the benefits from lower interest rates.", "The Board concluded that it was appropriate to ease monetary policy further in response to the global COVID-19 outbreak to provide additional support to employment and economic activity. Members agreed that it was reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates would be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. Members also agreed on the importance of monitoring the rapidly changing developments closely in subsequent weeks and maintaining contact to assess the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak for the economy. The Board was prepared to ease monetary policy further to support the Australian economy."], "The Decision": ["The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.5 per cent."]}},{"Date": ["Sydney – 2 March 2021"], "Text": {"Members present": [" Philip Lowe (Governor and Chair), Guy Debelle (Deputy Governor), Mark Barnaba AM, Wendy Craik AM, Ian Harper AO, Steven Kennedy PSM, Carol Schwartz AO, Catherine Tanna, Alison Watkins "], "Others participating": ["Luci Ellis (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), David Jacobs (Deputy Head, International Markets and Relations, International Department)", "Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Ellis Connolly (Deputy Secretary), Alexandra Heath (Head, International Department), Bradley Jones (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Marion Kohler (Head, Domestic Markets Department)"], "International economic developments": ["Members commenced their discussion of international developments by reviewing the cross-country experience with <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> vaccine rollouts. Israel's progress in administering vaccines was the most advanced, with a small number of countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, likely to achieve widespread inoculation during the June quarter. Others, including Australia, Japan and countries of the European Union, were likely to achieve high levels of inoculation a little later in the year. However, many emerging market economies were unlikely to have sufficient access to vaccine supplies to achieve widespread inoculation for around a year or more.", "Members noted that the global economy was set to regain momentum over coming months, after a slowdown around the turn of the year induced by a resurgence in coronavirus infections in some countries. That said, the restrictions on activity reintroduced late in 2020 had resulted in less severe effects than those imposed in response to the pandemic earlier in 2020. With widespread inoculation likely to be achieved in a number of advanced economies in coming months and substantial further fiscal support in the United States in prospect, downside risks to the global growth outlook had receded. Members agreed that the prospects for a sustained global economic recovery were better than a few months earlier, although the path ahead was likely to remain bumpy and uneven.", "Members noted that the rebound in the demand for goods globally and the upturn in industrial production, particularly in China and elsewhere in east Asia, had continued to support commodity prices. Iron ore prices remained at high levels and the prices of many other commodities, including oil, coal and base metals, had increased strongly in recent months. The rebound in energy prices had been supported by cold weather in the northern hemisphere and the strong recovery in industrial production; base metals prices had also benefited from the rebound in global industrial activity. Other input costs, such as those for shipping, had also risen sharply in preceding months.", "Members discussed the role that fiscal stimulus around the world had played in supporting the rise in commodity prices and the more recent increase in inflation expectations. It was considered highly likely that the US Congress would pass another significant stimulus bill in the near term. As a result, some forecasters were anticipating that inflation pressures could begin to emerge in the United States within the following couple of years. In contrast, fiscal settings in some economies were expected to turn less accommodative in the second half of 2021.", "Members discussed the prospects for recent increases in commodity and other input costs to translate into a sustained increase in consumer price inflation. This was considered unlikely for as long as substantial spare capacity remained in labour markets and wages growth remained subdued. The international experience prior to the pandemic had underscored that a sustained period of tightness in labour markets would be needed in order to generate increases in wages growth, and, even then, would put only limited upward pressure on consumer price inflation. Even if wages growth did pick up, it was also possible that corporate profit margins in some economies could absorb an increase in labour costs before firms passed such costs through to final consumer prices."], "Domestic economic developments": ["Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that employment had continued to recover to be around ½ per cent below its pre-pandemic level. Full-time employment had also continued to recover. Much of the increase in employment in preceding months had been in Victoria following the easing of pandemic-related restrictions there in the December quarter. Nationally, there had been a sharp decline in total and average hours worked in January, which reflected more people than usual taking annual leave in January following unusually low numbers of people taking leave during 2020. Members welcomed the further decline in the unemployment rate to 6.4 per cent in January. The participation rate had remained high in January and, for most age cohorts, participation rates had been near or above pre-pandemic levels.", "Members noted that the recovery in domestic activity and labour market conditions had continued to be supported by highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The recovery would be further supported by the rollout of the domestic vaccination program. However, in the near term there was some uncertainty relating to the effect that the end of the JobKeeper program would have on labour market conditions. There was limited international experience to draw on in this regard; New Zealand had been the only country to have wound down its wage subsidy program, and very few people had been reliant on it when that program ended. Members also noted that a durable recovery from the pandemic would require a strong and sustained pick-up in business investment.", "Members discussed the near-term outlook for the unemployment rate. The end of the JobKeeper program was seen as unlikely to result in a sustained increase in the unemployment rate. A number of considerations informed this assessment. The number of people working zero hours in Australia had declined significantly in recent months to be close to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, some JobKeeper recipients, including the self-employed, were more likely to suffer a decline in income than lose employment at the end of the program. Information from liaison contacts had suggested that many firms in receipt of JobKeeper subsidies had already reduced the size of their workforces and were not planning on another large round of lay-offs. Against this, it was likely that some jobs that had been maintained because of the wage subsidy provided by JobKeeper would cease when the subsidy ended. Members also took note of the increases in forward-looking indicators of labour demand, such as job advertisements and vacancies. These indicators had suggested that the ongoing recovery in labour market conditions could be broadly sufficient to offset the job losses arising after the end of the JobKeeper program.", "Members noted that wages growth had remained low, at 1.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter. Some earlier wage cuts had been reversed sooner than expected, which had boosted wages growth in the December quarter, but this was concentrated in a limited number of industries. Stripping out the effects of temporary pay cuts and their subsequent reversal in the December quarter, wages growth remained very subdued. Indeed, wages growth remained around historical lows in many industries, consistent with there being spare capacity across the labour market. The share of firms in the Bank's liaison program with wage freezes in place had remained high, and most firms had continued to report limited upward pressure on wages despite anecdotal reports of labour shortages in small segments of the labour market. Public sector wages growth over the year to December was the lowest on record, and was unlikely to pick up noticeably given the caps on wages growth in place. Members agreed that a materially lower unemployment rate would be needed to generate wages growth in excess of 3 per cent, which in turn would be required to ensure inflation was sustainably in the 2 to 3 per cent target range.", "Members discussed the uneven recovery in household spending patterns arising during the pandemic. Expenditure on some goods, such as cars, had increased to a higher level than before the pandemic, catching up from an earlier period of weakness. The consumption of other goods, such as household equipment, had been very strong early in the pandemic, reflecting substitution from services consumption, but was now easing back towards earlier trends. Other types of consumption, including for some services that had been especially constrained by the restrictions on activity, had returned to around or a little below pre-pandemic levels, but were unlikely to expand much further in the near term. Members agreed that careful analysis of the different forms of spending would continue to be required to inform assessments of the sustainability of recent trends.", "Members noted that, following the declines in housing prices observed earlier in the pandemic, momentum in the housing market had picked up and price increases had become more broadly based. Price growth and overall housing conditions had been especially strong in the detached housing sector in outer metropolitan and regional areas. This had partly reflected strong demand from owner-occupiers seeking more space and from first-home buyers. Advertised rents had also picked up across the country. However, conditions in the apartment rental market in Sydney and particularly in Melbourne had remained subdued, with additional supply still being added to the stock of apartments. Members concurred that housing market conditions warranted close monitoring in the period ahead. In particular, it was important that lending standards remain sound in an environment of rising housing prices and low interest rates.", "Alongside lower interest rates, national housing market conditions had been supported by the recovery in the labour market and fiscal policy measures that had boosted household income and incentives for housing construction. Residential building approvals for detached housing had been supported by the Australian Government's HomeBuilder program and other state-based programs, which would boost housing supply. However, approvals were expected to decline from high levels in the period ahead as these stimulus programs were wound down. Once these buildings are completed, there could be a significant decline in construction activity, particularly given very low population growth. Meanwhile, approvals for high-density housing construction had remained weak and there were few signs of a pick-up in the near term.", "Members noted that unusual population trends during the pandemic had materially affected national housing market conditions and other parts of the economy, and would continue to do so for some time. Net overseas migration was expected to be negative into 2022, mostly because of the projected sharp decline in the number of foreign students and other temporary residents. As temporary residents typically live in the larger cities, their absence had especially dampened demand for apartments in Sydney and Melbourne. Members also noted data on domestic migration in Australia showing that the population flow from capital cities to regional areas had picked up. Net domestic migration to Melbourne had also turned sharply negative as fewer people moved there during the pandemic. Members agreed that developments in net overseas and domestic migration would continue to affect conditions in the housing market and the economy more broadly for a considerable period."], "International financial markets": ["Members commenced their discussion of global financial markets by considering the factors behind the recent rise in sovereign bond yields. Longer-term yields on advanced-economy bonds had increased significantly over preceding months, including for Australia. This had reflected growing optimism about the economic outlook associated with the rollout of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> vaccinations, a decline in <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> cases in most economies and upward revisions to the expected size of US fiscal stimulus measures. The more recent rapid rise in yields had been accompanied by an increase in the volatility of yields and a decline in bond market liquidity, particularly in the United States.", "The rise in longer-term government bond yields in advanced economies over preceding months had predominantly reflected an increase in compensation for future inflation. Members noted that the increase in market participants' inflation expectations had been to rates closer to, though no higher than, central banks' targets, following an earlier period where financial market pricing had indicated little prospect of inflation targets being met. More recently, there had also been some increase in real yields in most advanced economies.", "Although central banks had not announced any material changes to their asset purchase plans or guidance on policy rates since the previous meeting, market participants had brought forward their expectations for an increase in policy rates in a number of economies, including Australia. In many advanced economies, the first increases in policy rates were expected to occur as early as late 2022, according to money market interest rates. Members noted that this change appeared to be sooner than implied by market participants' own inflation expectations and the forward guidance from central banks that they would not increase policy rates until inflation had increased to be sustainably consistent with targets.", "Notwithstanding the rise in sovereign bond yields, global financial conditions had remained accommodative. Corporate borrowing costs had remained low and equity prices in advanced economies, including Australia, had increased since the start of the year, despite declines late in February. Equity prices had been supported by better-than-expected earnings results and upward revisions to corporate earnings forecasts over preceding months, consistent with the more positive economic outlook. At the same time, investment flows to emerging markets had remained strong.", "In China, overall funding conditions had remained accommodative. The People's Bank of China had overseen a modest tightening in financial conditions in recent weeks, while having emphasised that this did not signal a material shift in its policy stance. The Chinese renminbi had appreciated slightly against the US dollar since the start of 2021, and had remained around its highest level since 2018.", "Members also discussed the broader topic of China's evolving financial system and its global importance. China's policy response to the pandemic had placed more emphasis on avoiding a further rise in risks in the financial system compared with responses during earlier downturns. The crisis had also placed renewed focus on the authorities' long-running efforts to reconfigure the way the financial system supported the economy, with some elements having gradually become more market-based over recent years. Some investors had incurred losses on investments that they had assumed were guaranteed by the state. Also, there had been more flexibility in interest rates, capital flows and the exchange rate. Notwithstanding an increase in capital inflows, Chinese financial assets had remained a small share of foreign investors' holdings of foreign assets. Consistent with this, China's main influence on international markets continued to be through its large trade flows. Members also discussed how China's role in the global financial system might change in the years ahead. They noted that this would be affected by factors such as China's balance of savings relative to investment, the speed and extent of further easing in constraints on capital flows, and the extent to which the renminbi gained wider use in international trade and finance."], "Domestic financial markets": ["Domestically, yields on longer-term Australian Government Securities (AGS) had also increased significantly, and the spread between 10-year AGS and US Treasury yields had widened to around 25 basis points. Members noted that the decline in liquidity in the AGS market, while noticeable, had not been as significant as that experienced during the period of market dysfunction in March 2020. Yields on shorter-term bonds had remained anchored, although members noted that there had been some upward pressure on Australian 3-year yields late in February. This had required the Bank to purchase bonds in support of the target for the 3-year Australian Government bond yield of around 10 basis points, which was for the April 2024 bond. At the same time, yields on the November 2024 bond had increased along with the increase in longer-term yields. Market participants had brought forward their expectations of an increase in the cash rate, which had also been reflected in the higher yield on the November 2024 bond.", "The Australian dollar had appreciated since November 2020 alongside the significant increase in commodity prices. Members noted that this had followed the earlier depreciation of the Australian dollar, much of which appeared to have reflected anticipation of the Bank's package of policy measures introduced in November 2020. The Australian dollar was assessed as being lower than it would have been otherwise as a result of the Bank's policies.", "The Bank had completed a little over two-thirds of purchases under the initial $100 billion bond purchase program. Bond purchases under this program had been brought forward in the week leading up to the meeting to assist with the smooth functioning of the market. The announcement following the February meeting of an additional $100 billion bond purchase program from mid April 2021 had had little lasting effect on yields, which was consistent with this extension already having been reflected in market pricing.", "Domestically, low funding rates had continued to flow through to banks' funding costs. Some banks had drawn down further 3-year funding under the Term Funding Facility and many had indicated that they planned to draw down their allowances prior to the deadline at the end of June 2021. Also, borrowing rates for households and businesses had declined to new lows. Growth in housing credit had picked up a little further in January to be 4¼ per cent on a 6-month-annualised basis. Housing loan commitments had been strong, driven by demand from owner-occupiers. Lending to businesses had been little changed over the preceding few months, after having decreased over much of the second half of 2020."], "Considerations for monetary policy": ["In considering the policy decision, members observed that the outlook for the global economy had improved over prior months. While the path ahead was likely to remain bumpy and uneven, there were better prospects for a sustained recovery. Global trade had picked up and commodity prices had increased over recent months. Nevertheless, the global outlook remained dependent on responses to the pandemic and the risks of further outbreaks of <span class=\"no-wrap\">COVID-19</span> infection, and on the significant fiscal and monetary support around the world. Inflation remained low and below central bank targets in many economies.", "Financial markets had responded to the positive news on vaccines and the prospect of further significant fiscal stimulus in the United States. Bond yields had increased considerably over February, including in Australia. This increase partly reflected inflation expectations lifting over the medium term to be closer to central bank targets. The changes in bond yields globally had been associated with higher volatility, though with considerably less spillover to other markets than in March and April 2020. The Australian dollar had remained at the upper end of the range of recent years.", "In Australia, the economic recovery was well under way and had been stronger than expected previously. There had been strong growth in employment and a welcome decline in the unemployment rate to 6.4 per cent. The December quarter GDP data were expected to show that the recovery remained on track. An important near-term issue was how households and businesses would adjust to the tapering of some fiscal support measures. Members noted that there may be a temporary pause in the pace of improvement in the labour market, as many firms had already adjusted the size of their workforces.", "Despite these generally positive developments, members agreed that wage and price pressures had been subdued and were expected to remain so for several years. The economy had been operating with considerable spare capacity and the unemployment rate had remained high. Further progress in reducing spare capacity was expected to occur, but it would take some time before the labour market would be tight enough to generate wage increases consistent with achieving the inflation target. There are likely to be relative price shifts due to changes in the balance of supply and demand during the pandemic, and the Board would look through these transitory fluctuations in inflation. While annual CPI inflation was expected to rise temporarily to 3 per cent around the middle of the year as a result of the reversal of some pandemic-related price reductions, in underlying terms inflation was expected to remain below 2 per cent over both 2021 and 2022.", "Members discussed the rate of wages growth that would be needed for inflation to be sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. Assuming ongoing labour-productivity growth and a broadly stable profit share of national income, it was likely that wages growth would need to be sustainably above 3 per cent, which was well above its current level. The experience of other advanced economies over recent years had suggested that it would take a tight labour market and considerable time for higher wages growth to be sustained. The Board's judgement was that wages growth would be unlikely to be consistent with the inflation target earlier than 2024.", "Since the start of 2020, the Bank's balance sheet had increased by around $175 billion and a further substantial increase was in prospect. The Bank had recently purchased bonds to support the 3-year yield target and would continue to do so as necessary. The Bank was prepared to make further adjustments to its purchases in response to market conditions. The Bank had bought a cumulative $74 billion of government bonds issued by the Australian Government and the states and territories under the initial $100 billion bond purchase program. A further $100 billion will be purchased following the completion of the initial program and the Bank is prepared to do more if that is necessary. Authorised deposit-taking institutions had drawn down $91 billion of low-cost funding through the Term Funding Facility and had access to a further $94 billion under the facility. Members noted that the Australian banking system, with its strong capital and liquidity buffers, had remained resilient and was helping to support the economic recovery.", "The Bank's monetary policy settings had continued to help the economy by keeping financing costs very low, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise, supporting the supply of credit to businesses and strengthening household and business balance sheets. Monetary and fiscal policy had supported the recovery in aggregate demand and the pick-up in employment. The Board remained committed to doing what it reasonably could to support the Australian economy, and would maintain stimulatory monetary conditions for as long as necessary. Members concluded that very significant monetary support would be required for some time, as it would be some years before the Bank's goals for inflation and unemployment were achieved.", "Members discussed the operation of the 3-year yield target, to which the Board remained committed. Later in the year, members would need to consider whether to maintain the April 2024 bond as the target bond or shift the focus of the yield target to the November 2024 bond. The Board agreed that it would not consider removing the target completely or changing the target yield of 10 basis points. If the Board were to maintain the April 2024 bond as the target bond, rather than move to the next bond, the maturity of the target would gradually decline until the bond finally matured in April 2024. In considering this issue, members would give close attention to the flow of economic data and the outlook for inflation and employment.", "Members also discussed the effect that low interest rates have on financial and macroeconomic stability. They acknowledged the risks inherent in investors searching for yield in a low interest rate environment, including risks linked to higher leverage and asset prices, particularly in the housing market. Members noted that lending standards remained sound and that it was important that they remain so in an environment of rising housing prices and low interest rates. The Board concluded that there were greater benefits for financial stability from a stronger economy, while acknowledging the importance of closely monitoring risks in asset markets.", "Members affirmed that the cash rate would be maintained at 10 basis points for as long as necessary. They continued to view a negative policy rate as extraordinarily unlikely. The Board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For this to occur, wages growth would need to be materially higher than it is currently. This would require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market. The Board does not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest."], "The decision": ["The Board reaffirmed the existing policy settings, namely:"]}}
